<NAME/>,

I need your help on 2 EASY things -

1)  I have been discussing fixed price baseload gas for United Technologies @ PG&E City Gate for June 2003 through July 2006.  United Technologies is a subsidiary of United Airlines.  What do I need to get from them to satisfy your credit requirments?  And once we get that, I would like to send them a Master Draft to be prepared to transact when/if the time comes.

2)  THIS IS REAL DEAL:  Merced Irrigation District.  They are looking to purchase gas, 2040/d, at PG&E City Gate for March 03 through Dec 2005.  I gave them an indication of $3.85.  I also am having structuring price up a blend and extend to blend the gas we sold to them Mar 01 - Feb 03 @ $7.85.  Where are we with respect to credit with them and what would credit require in order to do either one of these deals?  They were concerned about what credit would require.  

Please let me know as soon as possible!  I haven't bugged you much lately and I don't want to go to credit jail!

Thanks,

<NAME/>

Are you ready for the visitors this weekend?
<NAME/> the weather is great!

Looks like tonight will be really stormy.
Flash flood warning is in place.
Sounds like things should clear up and be beautiful by noon on Saturday.
<NAME/>'s birthday is Monday so we are planning on taking 3-4 kids with us to the lake house.

Have a good day.
Talk with you this weekend.

I saw the memo.   It is true about the startup charges.   It is listed in the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
Is there more that we need to discuss on this deal?

Things are going pretty well -  balance of month trading $43.75 in Entergy and it is going to be 90 degrees all of next week!
I heard that PV is down and its 1,000 degrees in the desert -  you guys must be busy.
<NAME/> Ryan called for mild in the Northeast next week when Earthsat was preaching hot ........   did really well on that deal as I was short balmo  the Cinergy.
He's the man (this week).

I saw Swerzbee and Motley at the K-derby.    That was a good time,  but it was bright sun and hot,  while we were wearing the traditional suit and tie.
There was a trader at the party that weighed about 320.   He was wearing a black wool sportcoat and a khaki colored shirt.    He tried to take his coat off but strangers were dogging him about his sweat rings,  so he put it back on..........poor bastard.

Louisville Slugger factory and museum kicked ass.    They had all the original bats from <NAME/> Cobb,  Babe <NAME/>, etc to current players.
The have been custom making bats since like 1847.    Good trip -  see you there next year!

Group,
EOL is off to a great start and is already becoming an integral part of the real-time market! Each person who has put in substantial extra time entering and reconciling deals deserves congratulations. I do recognize and appreciate the hard work. As always, there is more work to be done. We have had significant difficulty integrating the increased volume of EOL trades into our current business practice. Some members of the group have experienced limited success, others have experienced little to no success. A standardization in our process will benefit the entire group and will allow us to make consistent improvements as time goes on. So going forward.

	1.	All deals will be done under ST-Whourly. If there is lending, parking or a cut that corresponds to another book, we will make that deal for the entire strip (for 	example, W-BOM sells to EPE for HE 7-22--all one deal). We will then sell or buy the appropriate amount of energy from Whourly to that book (this interdesk deal 	will not be routed). We will do the interdesk transaction as one deal and will enter deal strips with pricing for each hour or hours where appropriate and will include 	transmission charges when necessary. In Enpower, use strips wherever possible...try to avoid extending deals in scheduling.

	2. 	All imports and exports will be under the appropriate desk (for example ST-SW exporting from SP-15 to FC MUST be under ST-SW in CAPS).
	This will allow us to put everything under Whourly and have export/import fees paid for by the appropriate desk. Otherwise the Whourly book will be charged for 	wheeling and/or potentially congestion for other desks. When filling a Service customer (such as Wheelabrator or EES) we should pay for the import and export 	fees.

	3.	A "skeleton" of an inc sheet should be developed as soon as possible each day.  Sales/purchases to or from EES should be made for the day and 	immediately input into the service sheet. Likewise...Service deals/Lending/Parking should be put into the sheet for the day where possible.

I would like to implement all of these practices immediately. Effective HE 1 08/29/01, THIS is our new business practice. Spread the word. I am looking for more suggestions for improvements on our process. We will have a meeting on September 4 to discuss group direction and ideas for improvement. This will be an important meeting at 4 PM on Tuesday September 4th. Please plan to attend.

See me at any time with suggestions or comments.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

Thanks for the email and the first draft.

Then if any of our respective commercial folks have any changes we will be that much closer.  Thanks again for all  your help.  Talk to you soon.

Hi <NAME/>,


As we discussed the pricing for December, 2001 will be as follows (all prices are estimates at this time and will follow the direction of the NYMEX):

For <NAME/> to perform full balancing, this means if you nominate 1,000 MMBtu/d and you burn 2,000 MMBtu/d or if you nominate 1,000 MMBtu/d and you burn 500 MMBtu/d..... the price will be  an estimate of $3.10 per MMBtu for December, 2001




For <NAME/> to perform the service, just as we are currently doing for November, 2001, whereby you buy or sell the difference at a Chicago Gas Daily price.....the sales price for a baseload quantity (you select your quantity up to 1,500 MMBtu/D) will be an estimate $2.85 per MMBtu/d.


As I stated above, all the prices listed above are estimates.  As of this date, <NAME/> will need to receive a pre-pay on the above listed deals.

Please call so that we may discuss.

Thanks




P.S.  The burns are as follows:

Date		MMBtu/d

11-12		  581
11-13		1876
11-14		1287
11-15		1180
11-16		1038
11-17		  690

We currently have an accumulated imbalance due TW from PNM of approximately 375,000 mmbtu.  We do not 
need to let this keep growing.  Talked with <NAME/> Thompson (PNM) and we both have agreed that TW is not 
to over deliver to PNM until we can verify the measurements.  We need to keep the total order in balance.
We will work on this next week.

The imbalance becomes part of thecumulative imbalance subject to book-out/cash-out.  The alert day imbalances are treated differently - the alert day imbalances are settled at 200% of the high (weekly) index for overburns on an overage alert day and 50% of the low ( weekly) index for underburns on an underage alert day.

Good luck with the paper...I know how inspired you get when deadlines start approaching, so I'm sure it'll be fabulous.  Sorry about the pulled muscle.  What exactly does that do to the marathon plans?  <NAME/> you be able to compete still, or are you just going to hit all the wine stops now?  

I think you're right about <NAME/>'s move to Dallas. I have a feeling she's actually going to really like being there and working.  I pretty sure the folks are still helping out with living expenses, etc. so she won't have to make too big of an adjustment right off the bat.  

As for me, Seattle could definitely be a destination but it would require a job change.  <NAME/> doesn't have any offices up there.  The closest office is Portland and for obvious and now unavoidable reasons I don't see a move there any time soon.  You are right about not being able to go wrong with a place possessing <NAME/>-like qualities...they are highly desirable.

I will most certainly try to keep the September date open...it would be great to see <NAME/> and Arden.  We had <NAME/> E.'s bachelorette party Saturday night (plus a bridal shower earlier that day).  <NAME/> hosted <NAME/> White's at the apartment the same night.  I got to see and visit with <NAME/> Kenair (sp?), <NAME/> Pitman, <NAME/> Pack among others.  Very interesting.  The two bachelorette parties met up at Black Swan for late night dancing.  Lis was in rare form.  I knew it was bad when she ran up and started hugging me....I think she almost crushed <NAME/> and Kelly.  Anyway, it was actually pretty fun and I've decided I really like <NAME/>'s sister <NAME/>...good sense of humor and not at all be-boppy.  I did manage to trick her into doing the V-I-C-T-O-R-Y cheer at Black Swan though.  I thought it was pretty darn funny myself...she was mortified when she realized I'd got her to do a cheer.

Once again...best of luck banging out your opus.  Talk to you soon.

once, a long time ago, i think you copied some words of wisdom for me from the Importance of Living...if it wasn't you it's not important, because the point is that i recently found them again and reread them today.  i think you should read them too, if not for the first time, then again and with fresh eyes....

"the ancient people who desired to have a clear moral harmony in the world would first order their national life; those who desired to order their national life would first regulate their home life; those who desired to regulate their home life would first cultivate their personal lives; those who desired to cultivate their personal lives would first set their hearts right; those who desired to set their hearts right, would first make their wills sincere; those who desired to make their wills sincere would first arrive at understanding; understanding comes from the exploration of knowledge of things.  when the knowledge of things in gained, then understanding is reached; when understanding is reached, then the will is sincere; when the will is sincere, then the heart is set right; when the heart is set right, then the personal life is cultivated; when the personal life is cultivated, then the home life is regulated; when the home life is regulated the national life is orderly; and when the national life is orderly, then the world is at peace.  from the emperor down to the common man, the cultivation of the personal life is the foundation for all.  it is impossible that when the foundation is disorderly, the superstructure can be orderly.  there has never been a tree whose trunk is slender and whose top branches are heavy and strong.  there is a cause and a sequence in things, and a beginning and end in human affairs.  to know the order of precedence is to have the beginning of wisdom."

right now i think both of us are at the beginning, i.e. "exploration of knowledge of things"...and i think the "things" in this instance refer to those "things" in the past year which have dumb-founded us each individually.  i know you want to get to those heavy and strong top branches (and i think to a large extent children and caring for your partner in old age represent those branches for you), but they will not come without the trunk...you can't jump the sequence of things.  now is the time for exploration, and i believe you are well on your way in that regard, but above all you must remember that time is the key...and that you can't rush yourself in this process.

hope the skiing is great and i will talk to you soon.

Group,

We are continuing to refine our deal entry techniques and spreadsheet techniques. We are having great success with EOL so far. For further clarification.
	


	1. ALL DEALS UNDER ST-WHOURLY--except a lending/parking deal or cut. For example if we are lending with ST-SW and we buy for them in NP-15. The buy in NP-15 is under ST-WHOURLY, the EPMICALPOOL Buy/Resale from NP-15 to FC345 is under ST-WHOURLY, the INTER-DESK sale is made under ST-WHOURLY (at the end of the day--see #3), and the sale to EPE is under ST-SW. The export in CAPS is also under ST-SW.

	2. ONE DEAL FOR AN ON-PEAK or OFF-PEAK PURCHASE or SALE.--For example one deal for a sale to the imbalance, one deal for a sale to EPE

	3. ONE DEAL FOR AN INTER-DESK SALE or PURCHASE--done by the NIGHT SHIFT at the weighted average price for the entire strip, transmission costs should be included. We are just averaging the purchase price or sale price for specific deals. (see ST-WBOM SP-15 section of AUG TRADING sheet on 08/29/01 for an example)

	4. INC SHEETS MUST BE MAINTAINED, DEALS ENTERED AND ROUTED EACH HOUR--only way to stay ahead

	5. WE ARE GENERATING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE REVENUE AND PROFIT TRADING WITH EOL (over $130,000 in the last 5 days alone--does not include congestion revenue!)--530+ trades, 13,100 extra mws traded with EOL in 8 days.

	6. MEETING ON TUESDAY 09/04 at 4PM


Finally, I will be out of the office for Friday and will be in Seattle through Sunday. You should be able to reach me on my cell phone (503) 887-3449. If you can not reach me, please refer questions regarding trading to Ryan Slinger, (503) 789-1306.

Citizens Griffith Az. I/C (Mainline Takeoff)(GRIF)

The lo pressure alarm on the analog page for the downstream pressure going to the Griffith plant from TW's mainline 
has been reset at 800#.  
The lo lo pressure alarm is set at 750#.
Reason:  This should give you time to react to possible low pressure concerns in the 3 to 4 miles of pipe from mainline to 
              Griffith plant and hopefully prevent any plant upsets.  This is for our protection.  You may need to raise the
              setpoint.
For call outs for alarms TW operations is responsible. 

If anyone does not agree with this please let me know and we can discuss.

Griffith Power Plt. El Paso and TW (CITZ)

We monitor these two sites as EMAR for Citizens.  Remember anytime you receive alarms on these points you refer
to the call out list for Citizens.  If you have questions please refer to the handout you received or call me.
The plant is currently down and planning on coming on line and commercial Tuesday September 11.
There are still some questions on which is the better way to set the site for flows.  Let me know what you think of 
setting TW on pressure control and El Paso on flow control.  
Reason:  TW pressure is higher and with El Paso on flow control this will allow TW to take the swing when Griffith
              has orders from both pipelines.  Let me know of your experience with this and let's discuss and write up  
              some guidelines for us to follow.

I was also fortunate to have very little <NAME/> stock exposure. Many of my friends have not been so fortunate. They are losing their jobs plus they've lost most of their net worth.

Andersen is tight lipped because their butts are on the line also. I don't understand how they could have allowed <NAME/> to guarantee so much debt and then keep it off-balance sheet.

Are you all going to Port Neches for Thanksgiving? <NAME/> and I are going tonight. I hope that you all have a very nice Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Many Happy Returns,

<NAME/>

<NAME/>,

This brings us back to the age-old question.  During an emergency, how we can tell what the highest price paid for energy by California is?  Their market clearing price does not include all the spot market energy that they purchase.  The CISO has acknowledged buying well over the artificially low federal price cap from in-state muni's (LDWP, SMUD, etc.) but none of this information is passed on in a timely fashion.  And what qualifies one counterparty for a penalty, and another counterparty for a "do-over" (could be assessed)?  

We will continue our practice of notifying the CAISO as soon as possible regarding outages.

Thank you for the information and the follow-up.

Citizens is going to sign the agency and operating agreement today.  TW will be taking over the operations
and monitoring the Griffith plant on Citizens behalf.  We will be monitoring the alarms at the plant and you have
a call out sheet for Citizens personnel.  We also will be responsible for the operations at the plant.  Currently
in Scada we have Griffith Power Plant El Paso and Griffith Power Plant TW.  Please get familiar with the points
and how set points will need to be sent.  To change El Paso, the set point will be at 1.  TW will be at 2.
When you send flow set points of 140,000 that will automatically convert to pressure control.  Set points less than
140,000 will stay on flow control.  We will have to experiment with set points when we have orders on TW and 
El Paso.  Currently we have orders just off of TW.

1.  Currently El Paso is set on 140,000 flow which will control on pressure and TW flow set point is at 120,000.
     this is on flow control.  
2.  When we have a flow order from El Paso we may want to set them on flow control and TW on pressure.   We
     will just have to experiment with the best operation. 
3.  Remember the above mentioned is at the plant and not at the TW Mainline I/C.  We are working with Citizens 
     to be able to see El Paso Mainline I/C.(El Paso will be responsible for the Mainline I/C and setpoints.) 

I put a copy of the agreement in everyone's inbox for your review.  
If you have questions we can get with <NAME/> Lipke with Citizens and ask for their help.  Last conversation with him
was we would just have to operate and see which scenario best fits the situation.  In other words they really don't
know which is the best way to operate.

Hey <NAME/>!  Very glad to finally hear from you.  Sounds like you are happy back in Austrailia!  I would love to see it sometime.  Unless things change between now and January, some of us are suppose to be on the Poly on January 6th.  We have booked our trip and the pictures of the beaches on St. <NAME/> look fabulous.  We are going in on the 3rd to stay a few days before we get on the boat.  I hope you are there.  Although I would understand if you stayed where you are!  Keep me posted on your plans - whether you stay in Austrailia or go back to work on the Poly.

As for the recent tragedies here, I am so very lucky that no one really close to me was killed.  I actually flew in from <NAME/> on Monday night, just in time not to get stuck there.  One of my very good friends was suppose to be in the WTC, worked on the 105th floor of tower one on monday and was called back to <NAME/> for a meeting tuesday.  Flew out of Laguardia at 7:30 am tuesday morning.  That meeting saved his life.  I am so glad that he had that meeting.  I would have been devasted if something had happened to him.  However, all of the people in their offices there are missing.  He is very sad but greatful to be alive.  It does make you think about what you are doing with your life and what is important but I don't think it will make me stop traveling or doing the things that I love to do.  It is sad that this thing has already affected our freedom, some more so than others.  Most things won't be as easy as they once were - but I guess that ease and freedom were taken for granted.  I also can't believe that someone could come in and do so much harm to innocent people.  And I don't know what should be done to stop such things from happening in the future.  Can I just run away to the beach and ignore it?  It's a good thing that not everyone has that attitude! 

Anyway,  I am glad to hear that you are well and having fun.  I am doing the same - just here in ugly <NAME/> for now!  I think that my trip to Aruba for October has changed so I better get something planned before the end of the year!   Please let me know if you are back in the states and if you go back to the Poly.  Oh, and thanks for the picture!

Take care,

Group,

A quick important reminder. Recently our disputes with EPE and other SW counterparties have been growing. While I recognize that we have some newer members in the group, it is the responsibility of the senior members of the group to train and help the newer members to avoid mistakes. The EPE system is not overly complex. If you have questions during a shift call ME first. Do not wake up <NAME/>, do not go inadvertant. Our notes on the deal sheet need to include whether the power is firm or econ (again--you should almost never buy econ--). The EPE lending fee was recently renegotiated down to $2. We have to be sharp in our marketing of their system to maintain our ability to lend and to lend at $2. Disputes with counterparties will quickly erase this opportunity. Marketing for EPE, making appropriate choices with regards to the units, checking out with dispatchers on time, and reconciling the CARP are basic expectations for this position and MUST be met. If you have questions, please see me. We will discuss EPE and EOL in our meeting at the start of September.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related to HPL.  <NAME/> did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda rough this time.  In addition to <NAME/> leaving during the middle of the week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.  It's a little harder to get things done.

Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see <NAME/> go down.  We taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank, except on his stomach.  <NAME/> is doing his best to either run <NAME/> off or make him tough.  <NAME/> runs over <NAME/> with his toys, pushes <NAME/> out the way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect <NAME/>, though, he gets right back up and keeps on going.

Anyway, I need to get back to work.  <NAME/> the family is doing well.  Maybe you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next couple of days.

<NAME/>:

A rumor is going around that <NAME/> Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response:
	1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an <NAME/> entity.
	2)  If such a clause does exist what is <NAME/>'s intent as far as payment or litigation?
	3)  What other <NAME/> employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?

<NAME/>,
I also had a question on a PMA from January.  On TransAlta deal #509285, your notes indicate that mw volumes for HE 23 and HE 24 were reduced by 95 mws each hour.  Enpower and the inc sheet do not reflect this change.  The PMA indicates a charge of $42750 for a reduction in our purchase from Transalta.  Why would we receive a charge for a reduction in purchased energy (ie. less money from us to Transalta)?  There is no indication of a reduction in volume on the other side of the trade (sale to Sempra-Deal#509277). Please come see me when you have a chance.  I think we need to go through this.

Hey guys,

Thought I'd drop you a line and catch up on life.  If I'm not mistaken you're actually in Australia right now doing all kinds of fun and active things, so you probably won't get this for a few days.  I can't tell you how glad I am that you've had a chance to take advantage of all the travel possibilities on that side of the world ( and not just a little jealous).  I think all of these experiences are going to leave you with some incredible memories of your time in South Korea.  

As for myself, this weekend will mark only the second in the last month and a half or so that I will be spending in <NAME/>.  I figured by now I'd be traveled out but I can't get enough.  The Caymans were incredible...we ate at great restaurants (not Bed unfortunately, but I did see it), got to go scuba diving off the east end and swam with a slew of stingrays.  Actually, I was holding onto/bonding with one of the stingrays, just floating with the current, for about 5 minutes until I had to gently shove it off and swim back into safe proximity of the boat.  It was a completely surreal experience.  Plus, the trip solidified my appreciation and fondness for the new job, and more specifically the new co-workers, which is never a bad thing.

Speaking of the new job, things are going well.  I still have a ton to learn but I have a feeling that will be the case for a long time to come.  There is just an overwhelming amount of information, not to mention strategies and nuances to learn about gas trading as a whole and in particular the western region of the US.  I've been actively trading for well over a month now and am getting to know all the players in my market as well as gaining confidence with each additional trade.  So far so good though...I'm definitely glad I made the choice to stay in <NAME/> and take on this role.

I had a pledge sister's wedding in San <NAME/> a few weeks ago, which was fun, and another "sister's" wedding this weekend here in <NAME/>.  I tell you, it's out-of-control with all of my friend's weddings & engagements.  Two weekends ago I got hit with 3, yes you heard correctly 3, new engagements of close friends.  I am very rapidly becoming out-numbered on this front.  Still, the only thing that crosses my mind each time I hear of a new one, aside from being thrilled for the happy couple of course, is that I am a ways off from such an endeavor myself.  I just have the feeling I've got a lot of changing to do in the next year or two (or more) and am not sure that what I'd want now is what I'll want then.  Okay, change of subject...getting to deep.

Two weekends ago I went with a few of the traders from the desk to Las Vegas.  We went to meet some of our power traders from Portland to discuss west energy issues and to try and squeeze in a little fun.  Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, I think we managed to squeeze in more than a little fun.  I think my earliest arrival back at the hotel room that weekend was around 6:30 am.  I don't know if it's the oxygen they constantly pump into the clubs and casinos or the steady flow of free drinks, but you really do lose all track of time there.  I feel certain any duration longer that a weekend would either kill me or force me to take another vacation just to recover.  I managed to walk away only $40 bucks in the hole so all in all I was feeling pretty good.

What the future holds? - I'm planning a trip to London in early June to visit <NAME/> and then she comes back to <NAME/> for about a month, so I'm really looking forward to that.  And, I'm still trying to figure out when I'm going to come visit you guys...I was thinking August, given your trip to Hawaii in July and my trip to London in June, so let me know your thoughts.  September is also an option if that works better for you.  I think I'll try to take 6 or 7 work days off so that we could travel while I'm over there if we wanted to and so we'd have two weekends.  Anyway, it's obviously still in the incubation phase.

<NAME/> the trip was a rousing success and I'll talk to you soon,
<NAME/>

Terry, please review and let me know if this sounds OK.  Thanks. <NAME/>


	We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for
	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:

	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless
	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 
	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)

	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will
	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there
	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)
	   
	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle
	     for the gas day.  Today they only call an OFO before the gas day begins.
	     Starting Nov. 1, they can call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle,
	     including Intraday 1 and Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This
	     will be a major impact to SoCal's customers)

	5.  SoCal says the "windowing" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a
	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations
	     exceed their capacity.

	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This
	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that
	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please
	let me know.  Thanks. <NAME/>

Further to our conversation, below is language inadvertently excluded from the Master Agreement.  Specifically concerning Section 4.1 (page 2) and  the Material Adverse Change found in the Appendix.

 Turning to page 2 of the Agreement, Article 4 Defaults and Remedies should include the following language beginning in the middle of the section after ....."contract for each such Transaction and .....(ii) 
  
 (ii) ascertaining the associated costs and attorneys' fees.  To ascertain the market prices of a replacement contract the Notifying Party may consider, among other valuations, any or all of the settlement prices of NYMEX Gas futures contracts, quotations from leading dealers in Gas swap contracts and other bona fide third party offers, all adjusted for the length of the remaining term and the basis differential.  All terminated Transactions shall be netted against each other.  The Notifying Party shall give the Affected Party (defined in Section 4.2) written notice of the amount of the Termination Payment, inclusive of a statement showing its determination.  If a Termination Payment is owed to the Notifying Party, the Affected Party shall pay the Termination Payment to the Notifying Party within 10 Days of receipt of such notice.  If a Termination Payment is owed to the Affected Party, the Notifying Party shall pay the Termination Payment to the Affected Party within 10 Days of Affected Party's receipt of such notice.  At the time for payment of any amount due under this Article 4, each Party shall pay to the other Party all additional amounts payable by it pursuant to this Agreement, but all such amounts shall be netted and aggregated with any..... Termination Payment payable hereunder.  If the Affected.........


Concerning the "Material Adverse Change" the following is included:

 -, or customer ceases to be owned or otherwise controlled by its current ultimate parent, "owned or otherwise controlled by" meaning the direct or indirect ownership of at least 51% of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of Customers having ordinary voting power."

As more fully stated in the Amendment attached below.

 


If you are in agreement with these changes we can execute the Master Agreement and proceed with the Amendment.

Should you have questions concerning this matter or any part of the Agreement please do not hesitate to give me a call.  I apologize for any confusion and thank you in advance for your cooperation.

This process of discussing our internal draft really helped frame some issues in general and will facilitate our putting together a good draft for the EEI group.

Okay...On Friday they have openings at 10:00, 10:30 & 11:00 and Saturday there are openings from 2:00 to 5:00.  Either works for me.  The packages I'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops.  Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think?  (The lady at the spa recommended the second one)

Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or 
a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light 
misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion. 
Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment.

Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow.

Time: 90 minutes


Pacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant - 
are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub. You'll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute 
message that completes the treatment.

Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin.

Time: 90 minutes

This whole experience must be too much fun for you...getting to work with all these young pilots (any of them single?) and strutting your stuff. 

The trip to Park City was fantastic.  We had some really good meals and managed two solid days of skiing.  It dumped 2 feet of snow Sunday night so we had tons of powder on Monday to ski through...and to cushion our falls.  Tuesday was absolutely beautiful, sunny but still below freezing.  The views from a few of the runs at the top of the mountain were breath-taking.  <NAME/> took all the pictures on her digital camera, so as soon as she uploads them I'll be able to check them out and order a few.  This is my first day back at work this week and it looks as though they're moving me to another floor pretty soon...too much sensitive information up here I suppose.  It's fine though because there are a few others from the trading group who declined the UBS offer and will be housed on the other floor as well, so I will have company.  I've got a couple other leads to try and track on the job front...another company in Seattle and one in Richmond, VA that my old trader <NAME/> told me about.  I'm still glad I made the decision I did and am excited to see where that choice ultimately leads me.  Even <NAME/> (from my first group here at <NAME/>) is trying to help my find something in the Pacific Northwest.  I'm really curious to see what he may come up with since his acquaintances run the gamut in terms of interests and occupations. 

Glad to hear you're having a good time and helping out in the "effort", and I'll talk to you soon.

Hi <NAME/>

1.  We don't have a "one off form" for US power trading, but it may be possible to use the US GTCs (3 pages) - this document contemplates multiple trades but is shorter than EEI.  It however does not define INTO products, and in general EEI is much better and longer.  Credit usually insists on using EEI w full blown credit and product definitions.

2. Success always comes at a price - great job winning out the financial vs. physical debate.  (ps you may think the pain is over but ... in the US, meetings continue in August to finalize collateral annex and new products. oh boy).

<NAME/> all is good and Addy is doing well. Tell Tracy Hi and that I've been waiting for a psychological improvement before I call her - at this rate it may never happen so I'll just have to bit the bullet and call her in my never ending foul mood.  See ya all soon I hope.

I spoke with Dale Sanders at <NAME/> today.  They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get <NAME/> Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to <NAME/> being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. 

<NAME/> is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if <NAME/> decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.

If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern <NAME/> expansion. In addition, the <NAME/> market will definitely strengthen in the back years.

Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.

I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to <NAME/>.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

<NAME/>, I left a message for <NAME/> <NAME/> (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations

Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422
Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)

				Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554

As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.

We have four direct lines to the Ercot ISO that have been installed on each of your turrets.    As an ISO participant,  we are required to be staffed 24-7 to handle any request from the ISO concerning our generation, or to handle contingencies related to our preschedules.

If any of these lines should ring,  we need to be sure to pick it up.    Ercot  may just be testing our responsiveness,  or ,  they may have a specific question about the mock market that is taking place now.      Any questions that cannot be immediately answered should be relayed to Smith Day or myself.

We will be installing hardware soon that will receive generation instructions from the ISO.   For RT purposes,  this will be used for billing purposes.    Any action ordered by the ISO will also be communicated to the Control room simultaneously.   They will be responsible for the actual dispatch of the unit.

We will be announcing a meeting soon to describe our new Ercot world and to exchange ideas.    I would also like to have a session with the group to explain the logic behind the reports we are responsible and to explain how the whole floor works.    This can be a broad overview,  or we can drill down to specifics at your request.

  

Thanks for your attention.

Just in case you receive a call from either JB or <NAME/>.  They were called yesterday and I spoke with <NAME/> and let them
know they were going short again after we cleaned up their current imbalance over last weekend and Monday.  
They were short for Wednesday's gas day.  My conversation was with <NAME/> that they make adjustments to their nominated 
volumes or turn on more gas.  It does not appear they did either one.  I will call them this morning and let them know that 
they have until ID-1 to turn on more gas or cut their noms or TW will be cutting their market for ID-1.  Maybe this is a 
good opportunity to discuss park and ride again.  TW covered 7,000 mmbtu/d of Markets according to the scada numbers

I can show you what the difference is between <NAME/> Hub daily prices and CIG first of the month index prices, but that is kind of like apples and oranges.  To clarify, you do not have to buy on <NAME/> Online (EOL), we can quote you physical prices over the phone and you can use EOL for price discovery.  You do not have to decide that now.  My recommendation is the attached:


<NAME/> changes are:

Volume - 20,000 mmbtu/d
Price - Gas Daily <NAME/> Midpoint plus $.05
Demand Charge- $6,000 per month

In addition. <NAME/> will provide market based pricing for additional volumes above 20,000 mmbtu

All of this is of course subject to negotiation of the appropriate contracts and <NAME/>'s review of the PSCo transportation contract.

Each month, prior to bidweek, I pull up a monthly range in Path Manager to get a feel of how many of our swing customers operated in a prior month (or a month in a prior year).

When the problem occurred this month, I was attempting to view Apr 1-30, 2000 on <NAME/> Pipe Line, with HPL as the shipper.  This information is very important for my bidweek preparation.  So, I need to continue perfomorming this operation each month.  If needed, I can wait until 5 pm top view the range.

I tried to answer you but my response was returned undelivered.  Basically, the pool is agnostic, it pays power producers for the pyhsical energy delivered to the grid and it charges power consumers for energy taken from the grid.  Any financial arrangements between the buyers and sellers are not known to the pool.  The only mechanism the pool uses for physical power transactions is the direct sale mechanism.  The terms and volume of these direct sales are entered in the pool's trading system.  The pool then subracts the volume of the direct sale from the consumers and producers meter and pays/charges the producer/consumer on the net volume (i.e actual production-direct sales or actual consumption-direct sales)

When Colstrip goes down we will be short at Montana system and long at PGE System.  We need to buy a transmission wheel from BPA (Account#736780) from PGE System to the Montana System Border.  If need be we can also do a Buy-Resale with WWP to move the energy from PGE Sys/Mid-C/LOLO to the Montana System Border.  The method for documentation and cleaning up enpower are below.


1.) In enpower, build an index forward buy from PGE under LTNW book for the total amount of mws cut due to colstrip going down.  Use the DOW JONES MIDC index (remember to specify in the index if it is on or off-peak).  Enter an offset of .10  .  

2.) Enter a transmission deal from BPA.   (MIDC to MPC SYS)  The transmission fee is $2.52

3.) Go into deal scheduling and query  under the counterparty PGE.  Select all

4.) Bring up all deals of the counterparties involved at Colstrip---- specifically, Ashgrove,Conocpil, Energywesr, Louisiana Pacific, and Smurfit <NAME/>, etc.
	(these enpower deal numbers can be located under the counterparties name in lotus notes.)

5.)Zero out the buy from PGE @MPC SYS

6.) Finally link the deals.

7.) Check real time postion manager, make sure you are flat.

If you have questions regarding this procedure please let me know.
Thanks,
<NAME/>

Guess what.  I have the deal numbers in my notebook packed in  a box - but <NAME/> McMichael said we are not going to flow this gas until March.  I think he also said he is trying to resurrect the Con <NAME/> deal - which is probably similar to the Lilco deal with respect to the pipelines it flows on.

Transco does not have a pooling contract like many of the other pipelines on the East.  They assign the shipper a specific meter for that pool and you use your IT contract to nominate pool to pool stuff.  

I DID NOT CHANGE THAT OL CAPACITY TICKET BUT I THINK I WILL.  I'VE GOT TIME!!!!!!!!!

Okay, given the weather conditions out there right now I'm going to have to put a little extra planning into my packing.  I figure we'll be engaging in the following activities:  beach, shopping, dinner, going out, church and I think you mentioned something about a museum.  Given those various situations, I was wondering what you suggest I bring along.  For instance, am I going to need a jacket at night or is a sweater sufficient and what do you suggest in the way of "go-out" clothes?   Also, let me know if you hear anything about the spas...that way I can try and make a reservation ( I figure Friday mid-morning would be a good time.  We could go for a run in the morning and then I could go for the massage while you study.)  Supposedly, it's going to be warmer on Saturday than Friday so maybe we should plan Saturday as our beach day...of course, I'm completely flexible.  As for brunch on Sunday, I did a little research yesterday and came up with a few suggestions... <NAME/>'s on the Cove, The Marine Room, Brockton Villa, Trattoria Acqua and Pacifica <NAME/> Mar.  All of these, with the exception of Pacifica <NAME/> Mar, are in La Jolla so I suppose we'd have to take that into consideration...There is a Presbyterian church in La Jolla that could be an option (but if your friends have suggestions I defer to their judgement both religiously and gastronomically).  All of the places mentioned above, in addition to The Fish Market, Cafe Japengo and En Fuego Cantina & Grill, also sounded good for just regular meals.  Depending on local culture (and your own opinion) I was just going to let you know that I can go straight from the airport somewhere if you want on Thursday.  I didn't know what time people typically go out to eat or if you even wanted to go out Thursday night. 

I know, I know...I had way too much time on my hands yesterday.

In the end, I'll really do anything and go anywhere...just thought I'd help out with a few suggestions.

Love,
<NAME/>

An EFO is a result of parties not complying with an OFO after multiple notices.  PG&E can confiscate gas if a scheduling party is not in compliance.  The same rules apply to an EFO as an OFO.  EFO stands for Emergency flow order.

Hey Pooky,

The rest of the weekend was fine.  I forgot to tell you on Saturday night about our choir's performance at this community function we had.  In fact, I was on my way home when you and I were talking.  Sometimes our choir members are so sad, they don't always show up at functions and events like they should, unless its an opportunity to showboat.  So.....I had to sing on the front row on Saturday evening.  We sounded like crap....I was so embarassed, I actually got so hot and started sweating, because of my embarassment.  It was awful.  I just thought about that when your e-mail arrived.  Kendall was very whinny and cried alot yesterday, I actually thought he might be getting sick, because that was so out of character for him, but he's back to his old self now, just talking alot and being hard-headed.

I just called the lawyer again and got the secretary....she said that she had been out sick with pneumonia and the attorney had some major oral surgery, so she could not talk....so I'll give this firm the benefit of the doubt.  The secretary said she would have her call me back shortly or at least the secretary would call me and let me know.

So "F" is starting to feel the effects of his years of dishing out dirt.  I hate that it hurts, but most men do end up regretting their previous behavior.  I know what you mean about your Dad.  In my case, my dad would be saying, hold on....

Anyway, I love you too and can't wait to see where we both go from here.....

  <body>

For tomorrow, see the attached schedule.     This is what is communicated to Frontera.     The mw value at the top of the page indicates what their total generation should be by hour.   The Resource Plan shuold be identical to this row.       Row 5 mirrors the purchase from Frontera in Enpower.     The Mirant call and <NAME/>'s call (Ercot Asset Book - 100 mw's) are listed as well as any daily trades executed on behalf of Frontera.    Please familiarize yourself with this report    

The top line will indicate how much power is available for bal-day sales,  etc.    Additionally,   the Resource Plan needs to accurately reflect to Ercot what the plant is capable of.  For example,   if we are generating at the maximum of 450 mw's,  we need to reflect that the combined maximums on units 1-3   do not exceed this amount.

Otherwise,  Ercot thinks they can OOM you up.


Specifically for tomorrow,   please note that we are going from 135 mw hour ending 6 to 250 mw's hour ending 7.     The plant doesnt like to do this.  A 200 mw schedule would be much more preferrable for this ramp.
So either :
1.  purchase 50 mw's from RT market for he 7.    Change Resource Plan to 200 mw's for hour ending 7 only.  Put purchase from  in  Teco Services book.
Make another corresponding sale to Frontera counterparty in the Teco Services book.   If you dont make the second entry in Enpower the Teco Services book will be long for hour ending 7.
2. have plant drag  and buy imbalance - they will call to make this decision.  No entries will be needed.

Call if you have questions.

IT'S BEAUTIFUL WOMAN  MONTH & TAG YOU'RE IT!

Well, it is and that  means you and me. I'm supposed to send this to
[IMAGE]
FIVE BEAUTIFUL  WOMEN, and you are one of them!!! 
Facts on Figures; 
There are 3  billion women who don't look like supermodels and 
only eight who do.  
<NAME/> <NAME/> wore a size 14.[IMAGE]
If <NAME/> was a real woman, she'd have to walk on all fours due 
to  her proportions. 
The average woman weighs 144 lb. and wears between a  12-14. 
One out of every four college aged women has an eating!  disorder.
[IMAGE]
The models in the  magazines are airbrushed -- not perfect! 
A psychological study in 1995  found that three minutes spent 
looking at a fashion magazine caused 70% of  women to feel depressed, 
guilty, and shameful.   
Models  twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.
[IMAGE]
Today they weigh 23%  less.
[IMAGE]
~Beauty of a Woman~  
The beauty  of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, 
The  figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair. 
The  beauty of a woman must be seen from her eyes, 
Because that  is the doorway to her heart, 
The place where love resides.  
The beauty of a woman Is not in a facial mole,  
But true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul.  
It is the caring that she lovingly gives,  
The passion that she shows. 
The beauty  of a woman 
With passing years -- only  grows.

Hi everybody. It's <NAME/> <NAME/>. It's Friday afternoon, March 1. I hope everybody has had a great week. I want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week, so that you all will be fully in the loop. 
The week started in a rough-and-tumble fashion. I went to a town meeting Monday night to meet with a number of our ex-colleagues. Their disappointment, upset and anger is very understandable. I, along with the entire management team, have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues. 
In order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on, we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $5 million fund. We are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees. I wanted you to be aware of that. I really do appreciate and understand everybody's upset. 
Last Friday, February 22, we presented to the Creditors' Committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program. As can be expected, there was some push back from the committee -- there were issues about some of the data, there were requests for additional data and further clarification. 
The Creditors' Committee formed a subcommittee. We provided to them more data. <NAME/> McMahon and I met with them on Wednesday, February 27, and we met with them again on Thursday, February 28. We are scheduled to meet with them again on Monday and Tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the Creditors' Committee on this program. 
I have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is <NAME/>'s and my highest priority. It is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future, their future compensation, and any financial safety net, so we are going to have to move on this at light speed. I told the creditors' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of March 11 to motion this up to the court. I'll keep you posted on progress. I am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs. Hopefully, by the time we have the employee meeting, we can walk through the composition of the program in detail. 
The powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions. Hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week. Then, the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases. And it works its way through the review, approval and communication process. So hopefully, we'll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases. 
We reached an accord with the Astros this week to repatriate to <NAME/> $2.1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract. It is a shame we won't be in a position to support the naming of the field, but it is probably in the best interest of the estate. I got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning <NAME/> Field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex-employees' fund. I'd like your input on that. I thought it was a great idea and very generous. 
We are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month. Hopefully I'll be able to meet many of you there. I've tried to get around to say hello here and there. And again, I would encourage you if you have any questions, concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz. Sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you, but I'm making a very concerted effort to answer everybody's inquiries. 
Other than that I don't have a lot to report. We'll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program. Hopefully by next Friday I'll be able to report very substantial progress in this area. I want to thank everybody for their efforts, all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward. 
One other thing... 
We did have a bank meeting on Thursday afternoon. We have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here. We'll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting. I told the bank group, and it was echoed by management, that we believe there is a reorganizable, viable entity in <NAME/>'s future. I'll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting. 
Anyway, as I was saying... 
Thanks so much for all your hard work, your efforts, your dedication. I hope you have a great weekend. I'll chat with next week.

Reliant has indicated that we must use their paper - this point is non-negotiable.

<NAME/>, we will not wire any funds to Reliant until we have your approval of the contract.  I understand that you are also working on a gas contract with TXU.  We need one of these contracts in place so we can buy gas tomorrow morning, it doesn't matter which contract we have in place first.

<NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/>,
The prepayment that we were going to send to Reliant may be going to TXU instead.  We are coming dangerously close to defaulting on the Tallahassee contract.  Robin and I are going to work on a prepayment request for TXU after lunch.

<NAME/>, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys.  Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months.  In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system.  We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system.  BUT, <NAME/> <NAME/>, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies.  Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?  <NAME/> not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?

We have a buyback under HPL (#586534).  ENA had only 7,000/day scheduled at mtr 1373 in Feb.  In reviewing the daily volumes in POPS, I didn't see any days with flow under 18,000.  So, we should not need a buyback for ENA.  Any shortages should be allocated to the HPL ticket.

Sell hour ending 6 only- 30 mw's for Frontera tomorrow.   DO NOT GO TO THE POOL .
If you cannot sell the mw's for a reasonable price ($0 or greater) and the pool appears to be going to a negative,   call Jerry and wake him up.   Have him ramp up starting he 7.
Try to sell tonite if possible,  so we wont have to wake them up.

I have sold the swap to Frontera for tomorrow.

They will be short the following hours:

he 7 - 370
he 8 - 265
he 9 - 200
he 10 - 50

I have sold the swap to them at $24.50.   I sell fixed and buy floating.       If you think that the pool will be high,  then you buy fixed and take to the pool.
You will buy fixed and sell floating.    Net,  we are left with two fixed prices.  Very cool.

     For gas day December 6, 2001, <NAME/> did not schedule gas to the City of Mesa.  I was unaware of this until late in the day Dec. 5.

Hey <NAME/>,

<NAME/> you had an absolutely incredible honeymoon.  I'm sure it was a blast.  The reason I'm writing, actually, is because I left something at the church the night of the wedding.  I thought it had been taken to the country club but the wedding co-ordinators didn't have it.  Basically, it was a white plastic bag with a little kids t-shirt and a little girls shorts & tank top outfit (along with a little hand painted picture).  I bought the clothes in the Caymans for my niece and nephew, so ideally I like to track them down.  I was hoping you could tell me who I should contact about items left in the bridesmaid's room in the church.  I think the bag said The Wharf on the outside if that helps at all.

Hey, <NAME/>

We had a good holiday.  Except for the trip back...it usually takes around 9 hours.  Last night it took 12.  Other than that everything was good.  Played a little golf (play may be too strong a word).  Watched a little football.  Our game with Texas was much better than I expected.  I can't believe Colorado ran over Nebraska like that.  And the OU game...I love college football.  It is so much more exciting than the pros.

Right now, I'm just sitting here watching the stock price bounce around 3.85.  The big boys have been huddling quite a bit today.  I think that we are close to the end.  Layoffs should be announced tomorrow.

So, did you get the Christmas tree after the game?  20 footer?  We'll be out this weekend getting ours and putting up the lights.  <NAME/> doesn't know what's going on.  But, <NAME/> is all excited.  Everything he sees, he wants for "Chrimsas".  Knowing <NAME/>, I will probably have to anchor the tree on all sides to keep him from bringing it down.  We'll see how it goes.

There are several annuities related to the profit sharing of this deal.
First--
All deals should have been made under the ST-NW desk to route with the PGE deal-buy tranny-etc. (I recognize this did not happen but this was my intent and should or could have). Consequently all revenue from this deal originally went into the ST-NW book. Therefore. An annuity was made from ST-NW to ST-WHOURLY. Deal #531524--$23468. Next an annuity was made from ST-Whourly to LT-NW at $5472 to compensate LT-NW for the $48 purchase price (deal #531546). This left a profit of $17996 to be divided between ST-Whourly and L-Pac-30/70. Consequently, ST-Whourly made an annuity to L-Pac for their part of the profit share, Deal #531549--$12597.73. All this left RT with a profit of $5399. If you place all the deals under LT-NW...it will be a large impact on ST-NW, and will result in LT-NW getting paid a couple of times. These profit share numbers are accurate. After expenses--LT-NW gets $5472 for the original deal, then ST-WH gets $5399 and L-Pac gets $12597.73. All these annuities cannot just be killed as they liquidated on the 26th--of February. It is probably a better idea to put everything back under the ST-NW book...ideas?

If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to April sales)
2900 MT based on May Mont Belvieu plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on June Mont Belvieu plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on July Mont Belvieu plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion with <NAME/>. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's sales revenue.

Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes with the Progasco sale?
