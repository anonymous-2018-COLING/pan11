        Weekend Update: Go easy on yourself and others Friday. Set aside tight schedules and worries. Take things as they come, without getting bogged down in impossible expectations. Delays and adjustments are very likely. Saturday is excellent for making sense out of Friday's events. Calmly piece together fragments until they assume some sort of order. It is so important that you consciously forgive those who have disappointed or inconvenienced you or your loved ones. Hanging onto resentment will tear holes in your heart. Sunday brings bliss. Doubt is replaced with a comforting sense that all will be fine in time. Private talks with loved ones bring healing and emotional intimacy. In fact, you may experience a gratifying breakthrough in one of your most important relationships. Encourage your significant other to relax, dream, and cultivate hope. Things will evolve in wondrous ways. Graciously accept the unasked for changes entering your life and let the transformation begin. . . .

I'm sorry I haven't been more involved is setting this up, but I think the agenda looks kond of soft.  At a minimum, I would like to turn the schedule around and hit the hard subjects like Q3, risk management, and asset sales first.  I would also like to see a discussion on our funds flow, cash flow, and our balance sheet.  If we don't get these things right, none of the rest of it matters.
 
Also, I notice that <NAME/> Olson and <NAME/> Tilney are in attendance.  This should only be for presentation, as they are not members of the management committee.  It also seems a bit unusual to have <NAME/> Tilney present for a discussion on company image and presentation, and not have <NAME/> <NAME/>.

We are totally LBs. no DEs. We had a bad defensive game, which I hope turns around next week,

Yes and no.
I think in many ways he is very similar to us.  This is the lifestyle he has always led since college.  To settle down and lay roots somewhere is something that I know from talking with him pulls at his conscience often, that he wants at many levels....but is unfamiliar and therefore scary for him to consider doing.  

Just like our desire to live that kind of lifestyle...seemingly free, having only enough money to get you to the next destination...is extinguished by our practicality about things like retirement...providing for a family...and having money to do things that require money to do like ski trips, alaska, etc.

I think this just goes to show how difficult it is to make major lifestyle changes that go against years of living and thinking differently.  Not just adapting to new creature comforts but changing one's mindset...which is scary...and difficult.  

More than you bargained for in a response eh?

My accomplishments for the first six months of 2001 include the following:

1.    Developed New EES Trading Forms -- provided key legal technology and intellectual capital to rewrite EES forms to be largely consistent with the wholesale trading forms.

2.   Developed Setoff and Netting Strategy in the PG&E Bankruptcy -- led legal and credit team across all <NAME/> entities in minimizing <NAME/> credit and legal risks.  This required an expedited evaluation of <NAME/> positions and coordination across <NAME/> entities to determine the best possible approach to terminate and then value all PG&E contracts.

3.    Implemented New Document Retention Policy for Microsoft Outlook -- led the resolution of many critical document retention policy issues and implementation of a new policy across company lines in <NAME/>. 

4.    Thought Leader on Legal Risk Managment -- continued to develop legal technology for better management and reporting of legal risks across <NAME/>.  Legal Risk Memos and legal risk ratings are two examples.  These legal risk policies have been newly applied in South America and EES to better evaluate and manage the legal risks in those businesses.

5.     Developing New Businesses -- integral part in developing new businesses in freight, paper, steel, lumber, etc. by preparing trading forms and formulating new ways to manage legal risks.

6.     Deal Machine -- projects having lots of complex issues including LV Cogen II, Pastoria, Sithe, Invasion Energy, Electrobolt and Huntco.

7.     Management -- continued to build a deal-oriented legal team that understand the underlying businesses.

8.     New Generation of Master Agreeements -- taking the lead with ISDA in developing the next generation of trading master which would be a single master for all commodities, whether physical or financial.  This would reduce the legal work by half.

Hi Nik
 
 
This is the nasty side of American business.  There is nothing to be embarassed or discouraged about.  These are hard times and I think your graduation timing is no help either.  People graduating '98 through '00 had it goood.  But hang in there, opportunities are fewer, but they are out there.  You might want to broaden your search into energy and healthcare.
 
<NAME/> is one heck of a story. What a ride !  The only conclusion I have is, next time I see some professor about efficient stock markets, I am going to smack him bad. As hard it is to manage businesses in trouble, it is not easy to manage businesses which are over-valued either. There is huge propensity for management to be complacent and attribute it to themselves, while it might be the investors folly and nothing more.  I have been on the ride up and down and all I can say is you live and you learn.
 
I will look out for opportunities out here. <NAME/> is trying to stay close to core businesses but the energy industry in general is still hiring and complacent. You keep at it bud, and things are going to get better.  This market economy beast can be hard to handle at times but in the end it works out. Say hi to <NAME/> and <NAME/>.

Dear <NAME/>,

I enjoyed your article. You are right, we are a little sensitive.  That's a natural reaction when something you are so proud of is criticized.  I must admit I almost e-mailed you after reading your pre-game article.  What irritates my sensitivities is when it is pointed out that NU players have had trouble with the law.  These episodes, misdeameanors or not are not something any husker fan is proud of.  Surely there are players in every program who have fights with their girlfriends, or who drink too much and don't have the sense to leave a party when asked.  My problem is that whenever a NU player messes up, it is news.  It's as if there is a <NAME/> Journal Star reporter with an office in the <NAME/> PD complete with scanners, just waiting for some "news" to break.  I don't think ISU or any other school has such a spotlight put on them.  College kids everywhere do such things and pay for them quietly.  I don't wish we knew about every infraction at every school.  It would be nice if reporters could put things in perspective and stick to the event they are covering.  This all started when we were the defending and still contending National Champions who had the leading Heisman candidate in the backfield.  The <NAME/> Phillips issue back then was news because of the Heisman hype and because of the severity of his offense.  He became the posterboy for abuse of females, and perhaps rightfully so, but enough already.  Leave us alone until, God forbid, we end up with another <NAME/> Phillips.

Before I ramble on about this sensitive issue.  Let me thank you for your post game article which was fair and balanced.  You are right, Most NU fans are good, a few of us are not good fans or role models.   NU fans continue to wish ISU and Iowa the best.  Most of us are happy to see the Iowa teams do well.  Take care.

I'm sending the invoice/statement via e-mail.  Let me know if you can't open it.  The Crestone OBA Imbalance is the summary we started on showing the discrepancies on the receipt side.  A lot of it is rounding from the Crestone spreadsheets to our "whole" numbers we put into the Unify system.  The other Imbalance report is on the 3rd tab of the <NAME/> Statement report.  Let me know if you have any questions.

   A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN                                                 
                                                                                
   NEW YORK (DOW JONES)--THE CALIFORNIA SENATE IN SACRAMENTO PASSED A           
WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX ON SALES OF ELECTRICITY INTO THE STATE'S WHOLESALE         
ELECTRICITY MARKET MONDAY AFTERNOON AT 4:50 P.M. PDT. AT ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME
TIME, CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR INITIATED ROLLING BLACKOUTS FOR THE
FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH.                                                         
   COINCIDENCE? PROBABLY, BUT THE CONNECTION SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED.              
   "THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA TO DATE HAVE      
ACCELERATED AN ALREADY SERIOUS MARKET COLLAPSE," SAID A HARVARD UNIVERSITY STUDY
OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CRISIS LATE LAST MONTH.                                  
   THIS WEEK'S WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX BILL IS THE LATEST BLUNT INSTRUMENT WIELDED 
WITH POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS RESULTS. GOV. GRAY DAVIS WANTED IT AS A STICK WHEN  
                                                                          (CONT)
MEETING WITH EXECUTIVES FROM THE STATE'S MERCHANT POWER COMPANIES WEDNESDAY. THE
MANEUVER WAS LESS THAN ADROIT, AND THE GENERATORS WEREN'T IMPRESSED.            
   AFTER THE MEETING WITH DAVIS, RELIANT ENERGY'S (REI) JOHN STOUT SAID THAT IF 
THE TAX WERE IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA, IT WOULD "INSTANTLY BLACK OUT ALL THE   
GENERATION IN THE STATE."                                                       
   THE STATE'S LEADERS MIGHT KEEP IN MIND WHO WIELDS THE BIGGER STICK AT THIS   
POINT. CALIFORNIA SET UP A MARKET IN WHICH SELLERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE VERY
HIGH PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY SINCE SUPPLIES STARTED GETTING TIGHT A YEAR AGO.    
SELLERS SAY THEY HAVE PLAYED BY THE RULES THEY WERE GIVEN, AND NOBODY HAS PROVED
OTHERWISE WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF A FINE PAID BY WILLIAMS COMPANIES (WMB) FOR 
ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF VIOLATING A CONTRACT.                                
   "IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY INVENTED A NEW GAME, INVITED YOU OVER TO PLAY AND THEN   
CHANGED THE RULES A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME. THEN, AFTER YOU  
BEAT THEM, THEY INSIST YOU CHEATED," SAID ONE WESTERN ENERGY TRADER.            
   ALMOST EVERY ATTEMPT BY THE BUY SIDE - THE UTILITIES, THE ISO AND NOW THE    
                                                                          (CONT)
STATE TREASURY - TO LOWER PRICES HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER PRICES OR BLACKOUTS OR  
BOTH. THE WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX IDEA IS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE, BUT THOSE WHO   
INSIST ON PRICE CAPS SHOULD KEEP THIS IN MIND: THE ISO HAS HAD PRICE CAPS SINCE 
IT BEGAN OPERATION MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO. OBVIOUSLY, PRICE CAPS HAVEN'T     
WORKED, JUST AS THEY HAVE NEVER WORKED EXCEPT DURING WARTIME.                   
   IN FACT, PRICE CAPS HAVE BEEN A QUESTIONABLE MEDICINE PRESCRIBED FOR THE     
WRONG DISEASE. AT BEST, PRICE CAPS MIGHT RESTRICT PRICE SPIKES. CALIFORNIA'S    
PROBLEM IS PERPETUAL HIGH PRICES. IT CAN'T AFFORD THE GOING RATE AT NIGHTTIME,  
LET ALONE THE HIGHER MARKET PRICES DURING THE AFTERNOONS IN A HEATWAVE.         
   CALIFORNIA MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY BETTER THE GAME IT INVENTED. THE      
INSANELY COMPLICATED COMPUTER-BASED PURCHASING OF POWER ENDED A FEW MONTHS AGO, 
AFTER THE CALIFORNIA POWER EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED DOWN BY FEDERAL REGULATORS AND   
THE ISO LOST ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO BUY POWER. THE MATCH BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS 
AND THE ENERGY TRADERS WASN'T EXACTLY IBM'S "BIG BLUE" VERSUS GARRY KASPAROV.   
   ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE MARKET AGREES THAT THE UTILITIES' HUMAN TRADERS COULD 
                                                                          (CONT)
HAVE BOUGHT NEEDED POWER FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LESS THAN THE PROGRAMS THAT THE
UTILITIES WERE REQUIRED TO USE BY STATE LAW.                                    
   SINCE THE DEMISE OF PROGRAMMED PURCHASING, THE COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED  
BY HUMANS, BUT WITHOUT MUCH BETTER RESULTS. THE TEAM ASSEMBLED TO BUY TENS OF   
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF SPOT POWER EVERY DAY CONSISTS MOSTLY OF FORMER     
EMPLOYEES OF THE POWER EXCHANGE AND ISO, AS WELL AS EXPENSIVE CONSULTANTS WITH  
NO ENERGY TRADING EXPERIENCE. ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE TRADING TEAM, FOR       
EXAMPLE, IS A FORMER PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE POWER EXCHANGE WITH NO   
TRADING EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT JOB.                                    
   AS ONE ISO EMPLOYEE WAS WONT TO SAY: "IT'S LIKE WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME     
BETWEEN NOTRE DAME AND ST. MARY'S SCHOOL FOR UNWED MOTHERS."                    
   AND THE SIGNING OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FIVE- AND 10-YEAR CONTRACTS
IS BEING EXECUTED MAINLY BY FORMER EXECUTIVES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON -   
PEOPLE THAT LEFT THE UTILITY YEARS AGO TO BECOME CONSULTANTS AND ALSO DON'T HAVE
TRADING EXPERIENCE.                                                             
   GOOD IDEAS, MEANWHILE, HAVE LANGUISHED.                                (CONT)
   "WE ARE GOING TO INSTALL METERS IN EVERY MAJOR COMMERCIAL CONCERN IN THE     
STATE THIS SUMMER AND GO TO REAL-TIME PRICING," DAVIS TOLD WALL STREET ANALYSTS 
ON FEB. 28.                                                                     
   THAT PROPOSAL WAS GREETED BY MANY OBSERVERS AS THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE IDEA    
FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO DATE.                                             
   WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO REAL-TIME PRICING FOR CALIFORNIA'S BIG BUSINESSES SINCE 
THEN? NOTHING.                                                                  
   "THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA IS 'SPECIAL'," SAID STANFORD    
ECONOMIST AND CALIFORNIA ISO CONSULTANT FRANK WOLAK. EVERY INDUSTRY FROM OIL    
REFINERS TO INTERNET SERVER FARMS HAS HAD LOBBYISTS IN SACRAMENTO SUCCESSFULLY  
SECURING EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE.                                                
   "MY POINT HAS BEEN THAT IF WHAT THEY DO IS SO VALUABLE, THEN THEY SHOULD BE  
ABLE TO HANDLE THE HIGHER PRICES. BUSINESSES WITH ABOUT 10,000 MEGAWATTS OF LOAD
HAVE REAL-TIME METERS. EVERY ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE GETTING MARKET PRICES," SAID 
WOLAK.                                                                          
                                                                          (CONT)
   ONE OF THE GREATEST ADVANTAGES THAT SELLERS OF ELECTRICITY TO CALIFORNIA HAVE
HAD IS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE FIXED PRICES, SO DEMAND IS INFLEXIBLE. SELLERS KNOW  
EXACTLY HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY THE UTILITIES MUST BUY BASED ON TEMPERATURES AND   
THE TIME OF DAY, WOLAK SAYS, AND THEY SIMPLY SUPPLY THE MARKET JUST ENOUGH POWER
AT HIGH MARGINAL PRICES.                                                        
   REDUCING OVERALL CONSUMPTION THROUGH HIGHER RATES WILL HELP THE STATE SOME,  
BUT MAKING 25% OF DEMAND FLEXIBLE BASED ON PRICE WOULD GIVE THE STATE A FIGHTING
CHANCE IN THE MARKET, ACCORDING TO WOLAK.                                       
   BUT THAT, APPARENTLY, IS TOO COMPLICATED OR POLITICALLY DIFFICULT. PRICE     
CAPS, A WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX AND POLITICAL PATRONAGE JOBS FOR BUYING BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS OF POWER MAY NOT SAVE THE STATE FROM BANKRUPTCY, BUT THEY ARE EASIER TO 
SELL - OR SLIP THROUGH - IN SACRAMENTO.

This email just came in today.  One of our brokers from New York has a brother in-law who just summited Everest yesterday at 10eastern.  There is a west gas trader that works in new york that is writing the account below.  Apparently there was a drastic change in the elements and several are already dead and there is a major rescue underway.  I haven't even found anything on this yet on the internet, though i expect there will be news shortly.  I thought you all would be moved by this account.

Mikey all our fundies stuff is still locked down ...  try these web-sites:  Powerlytix.com and Friedwired.com (pw: enron, enron).  Next week we'll open the stuff back up ... I'm guessing exports to be close 3,000 MWs into Cal  through the Spring run-off  then up to 5,000 MW thru July  (on average about 4,250 MW) then dropping in Aug and Sept back to 2,500.

The power prices are not financially settled, they are settled by physical delivery, the gas prices are settled against 'Gas Daily' index. What we will need to also look at is, the contractual provision, for 2003 onwards, when the RTO is expected to kick in.
 
Also, lets look at some other term sheets and make a more robust one. What might be a good idea is to call <NAME/> Llodra and see if he has any old ones he could mail us.

Went OK.  I gave <NAME/> a few issues that need to be worked on.

1) Imports/Exports do not seem to be getting captured inFSP.
2)SC trades - some ponts other than CAlifornia were being captured.

Some progress was made on Generation.  If entered in Enpower correctly,they appear in FSP. The only problem is once we enter deals in enpower at detailed points, The enpower to caps report does not balance.  We need Enpower to caps to be reformulated to include all NP SP and ZP deals including those at detailed points like sdg1,pandol_6_unit, etc.

The 10day test for day ahead is done as far as i'm concerned.  <NAME/> was running template comparisons for the 1st thru the 3rd. which may need some work on our part.

Ok, kids ---

We SOLD flex CNG Flex deals to El Paso (opposite of this month) for May.  The sitara deals are as follows:

737642 - ENA buys 5,000/d baseload from El Paso at CNG SP for Index flat.
737647 - ENA sells 0-15,500/d to El Paso at CNG SP for Index plus $0.055.  El Paso must take 155,000 for the month.

737645 - ENA buys 5,000/d baseload from El Paso at CNG SP for Index flat.
737655 - ENA sells 0-15,500/d to El Paso at CNG SP for Index plus $0.065.  El Paso must take 155,000 for the month.


On deals # 737647 and 737655 (we sell to El Paso), the volume is in as a baseload of 5,000/d but the expected volume is zero on May 1-21, and 15,500 on May 22-31.  CHRIS - make sure we keep up with this on the morning sheet and that the volume is zeroed out in the system until they actually call on it.  They will have to call us by 9:30 am to take the gas on any day.

Mr. Lay-

After reading the news of your $60,000,000 to $80,000,000 payout, I am disgusted and appalled all over again.  Unfortunately, that's a daily occurrence.

I have been employed with <NAME/> since May of 1993, when <NAME/> purchased LRC.  I was very skeptical of <NAME/> back then and was unsure of my future with the company.  As time went on, I got more comfortable with the <NAME/> way and learned how to survive and even be a little successful here.  I became a believer in the things <NAME/> could accomplish, a champion of our hard-nosed, driven executives (at least some of them).  I bought <NAME/> stock and held on to those valuable options.

Over the last 18 months, my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly, sometimes daily, selling of <NAME/> stock and exercising of options by our top executives (past and present and including you).  We came up with all kinds of reasons that the executives would be doing this -- they're so overly compensated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlements, mistress settlements, buying a new home in <NAME/>, buying an island in the Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....  We never wanted to admit that they knew something we didn't.  Things were great, weren't they?  <NAME/> Skilling told us that <NAME/> was going to be the "World's Leading Company."  He even put the goofy acronyms on his car license plate.  He told us gas traders in February how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year. Now, being the cynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was hopeful; I figured that if <NAME/> had the audacity to throw out a number that high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e., +/- 20%. 

Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more options.  In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.  I'm afraid that there are many more just like me.  I'm fortunate in that I have many working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my savings again.  Many others are not that fortunate.  So many have spent their entire careers here, helping to build this company up.  They were looking forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.  And let me remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less than a month's compensation for you.  Now even that is essentially gone.  Other employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for their children's college tuition.  The stories are too numerous to list, and the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.

It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the industry and <NAME/>, that <NAME/>'s executives knew that there were skeletons in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.  The employees and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumbo-jumbo.  There should be an accounting for this behavior.  You and your cohorts have ruined so many lives.  Think about that while you're spending your millions.....

I know it seems gimmicky- but we sould keep a jar, and every time you get mad, I could put
a penny in it, and you can decide every day if I have treated you like enough of a princess to
take one out. Whatever is left after a month or so, we would take a getaway of however many
pennies are in the jar (not funded by the pennies, of course). This would really show how much
things have not gone your way, and would be a reminder for me.
We could also set up a <NAME/> jar, but I guess that would be less full.
I am brainstorming to try to get myself to behave, so I know it's corny.
