<NAME/>,
I am interested in speaking with you further concerning investment opportunities.     Although you mentioned that  the $1,800  (the amount in my account) is a small sum,  I have been reluctant to invest more money with your firm,   given to performance of the suggestions provided previously.   
I have been a market maker in the electricity business and I realize that no one is right all of the time;    I dont expect this.      However,   I do expect some consistent contact from a broker  who has been successful in his own trading, not just success in brokering trades.      My view will be that the more success we have,  the more money I will be willing to invest.

I am interested in discussing my specific financial situation with you  and learning more about you, your track record and your abilities.
I do wish to talk about covered calls on specific options that I have expiring in January.    I would also like to discuss any other profitable ideas that fit my profile.

I will not use your suggestions to trade at  discount brokerage or otherwise abuse our potential relationship.   


I look forward to hearing from you.

Sorry I didn't return your call last week.  I actually didn't check my voice mail until Friday after work and thus saw little point in calling back as you were probably in some remote area of pristine, scenic beauty by that time.  <NAME/> the camping trip was a rousing success and allowed you to reconnect with your old friends and old self.  I am in desperate need of natural beauty and negligible pollution but have alas been trapped in <NAME/> the past couple of weekends.

As we discussed, I intend to arrive at your offices at 9:00 am Friday morning.  To reconfirm, you are located on the 15th floor of the One Bellevue Center Building (411 108th Avenue N.E.

I will be staying in downtown Seattle Thursday night and will have my cell phone if you need to reach me for any reason - (713) 775-6472.

You have always been on the move seeking affectionate, satisfying and harmonious relationships. Your ultimate goal has been the realisation of an intimate union in which there could be love, self-sacrifice and mutual trust. It has often been said that "True love is just around the corner"...and maybe... if you haven't found it as yet - you possibly soon will. 

In the past there have been .. and maybe there still are many things that you have had to do without. You have now decided to set your sights on a position or situation that could give you greater prestige and which will afford you considerable self esteem.

You wear your heart on your sleeve ... and since you are an emotional person you are apt to give your all ... heart and soul ... to all those that show you a little affection ... but take care... it would appear that you have been extremely hurt in the past...and you keep leaving yourself wide open for punishment..

Whatever you strive to do, something always seems to be holding you back. There is no subterfuge in you. You are a clear thinker and all you demand from life, in a relationship, is a partner whom you can trust and with whom you can, together, develop a foundation of trust based on understanding. You are your own person... and you demand freedom of thought ...to follow your own convictions. You have no interest in "two-timing" and all you seek is sincerity and "straight-dealing". 

You wish to be left in peace... no more conflict and no more differences of opinion ... In fact you just don't want to be involved in any arguments of any shape or form ... All you want is for "them" to get on with it - and to leave you alone..

Can you tell me if this is correct? If yes, will these delivery points and volumes be in effect until the end of the contract? Can they be changed again? Do we have paperwork documenting the change?

<NAME/> Buehler told me that <NAME/> Lee x-3-7115 could be of assistance. Could you speak with him?

check out the following websites for airfare:

www.orbitz.com - the best so far.  
www.cheaptickets.com
www.hotwire.com - with this one, you see the offer but won't know the airline or flight times until you lift the offer

register for sidestep and it will show you what priceline offers anytime you look for airfare under any other platform

Then of course, there is expedia and travelocity - but they tend to be more expensive.  Also, sometimes when you check the same website again 5 minutes later, it will show a better price.  <NAME/>'t forget - tomarrow is 7 days in advance (that might matter)

A man was stopped by a game-warden in Northern Michigan recently with
two
buckets of fish leaving a lake well known for its fishing. The game
warden
asked the man, "Do you have a license to catch those fish?"

The man replied to the game warden, "No, sir. These are my pet fish."

"Pet fish?!" the warden asked.

"Yes, sir. Every night I take these here fish down to the lake and let
them
swim around for a while. I whistle and they jump back into their
buckets,
and I take em home."

"That's a bunch of hooey! Fish can't do that!"

The man looked at the game warden for a moment, and then said, "Here,
I'll
show you. It really works."

"O.K. I've GOT to see this!." The game warden was curious, now.

The man poured the fish in to the lake and stood and waited.

After several minutes, the game warden turned to the man and said,
"Well?"

"Well, What?" the man responded.

"When are you going to call them back?" The game warden prompted.

"Call who back?" The man asked.

"The fish." replied the warden.

"What fish?" The man asked.

The Index settles during bid week for the following month (last week of Sep for Oct) and is
published around this time. This curve is probably in the system as basis, code D, which is the
difference between the Index and NYMEX settle. This index is the Oct price curve (P) plus the Oct 
basis curve (D). Deals are +/- a few cents for 
The index (I) curve is next month's curve at what these differentials are trading at. It is not the actual
"index". It is what is added to the index for physical deals priced off index.

She lives!!!!  I know it's been ages since we've caught up on each other's lives.  I'm anxious to hear what's happening in yours in the upcoming months.  I'll have to give you a call at home some time so we can really talk.  As for a visit, you know I'm always up for a trip out to the coast.  I'm actually heading to Seattle next weekend with a friend from work and then August is going to be filled with a trip to <NAME/> (work related...I know tough) and a visit to S. Korea to see <NAME/> and <NAME/> for a week and a half or so.  I'm really excited about that trip...I think we're going to try and take a weekend jaunt somewhere like Singapore, Hong Kong or Beijing while I'm there.  So given all of that, what are your thoughts on Labor day weekend?  It's the first weekend of September...automatic 3 day weekend for me, so I could fly in around the same time I did on my last visit that Friday and leave Monday afternoon.  Let me know if that sounds good, or if there's some other weekend you had in mind. 

You'll have to tell both of the <NAME/>'s and <NAME/> I said, "Hello."  I had such a great time hanging out with all of them, and your cousin too.  You attract very fun and interesting people...it's a credit to your excellent company.  By the way, how are things in regards to <NAME/>...still just good hang-out buddies?  I'm assuming, since you didn't say anything in your email that things with <NAME/> are still good and if so, I'm glad for you. 

I went shopping at Stein Mart recently too and found some really cute things, I absolutely love that store.  And, I'm honored to be your shopping muse.

Love,
<NAME/>

PS - The job's still good and I miss you too.

I think the only difference btw the 330Ci and the 330i is that the Ci
is a 2 door.  

Had a choice btw Wed and Thur game - chose Wed.  Not that disappointed
though as the Astros proved to be the biggest bunch of pussies in the
ML.  They were more concerned with not giving up a homer to Bonds than
with winning the game.  Now they stand a chance of not making the playoffs
at all.  If you ask me they don't deserve it and the mgr should be fired.

It was great to hear the fans booing the home team every other inning.  I'm
sure they lost a lot of fans over those 2 games.

Anyway, what's up on your front.  Are you still going out to Cali to visit
Hop and <NAME/>?  How's flying?

Its been a very interesting ride these last four and a half years here.  I received an offer from UBS, but decided to turn it down for personal reasons.  These last few weeks I have been with the estate working on selling certain assets.  Tomorrow is my last day with the estate and then I am off to Ohio and Cinergy to continue trading.  I will also begin to learn the oprations of Cinergy as well as go back and get an executive MBA at Chicago.  Ultimately, I want to learn more about the overall operations and effective energy risk management.  
I just wanted to thank you for all you have done while I have been here.  I look back and think that I should have spent time in the pipeline group.  Even after all that has happened I certainly wouldn't change what I have experienced.  Thanks again for being such a good friend.  <NAME/> you are doing well and good luck with everything.  I will send you my new information at Cinergy.  My Dad would love to hear from you sometime.

We need to ensure that the minimums and maximums accurately reflect what the plant is capable of.

<NAME/> and Dari, here is my answer.  Are you comfortable with it
	before I send it to the shipper.  Thanks. <NAME/>

	Answer:  If an interruptible shipper is bumped in the Intraday 1
	         cycle, the shipper will keep 1/3 of their scheduled volumes.
	         Shippers schedule becomes their actual unless they are the
		   operator of the point.  Therefore, they would not encounter
	         a DDVC penalty.  If the Shipper is the operator, NNG looks at
		   total scheduled volumes vs total actual delivered volumes and determines
		   if a DDVC is appropriate.  The DDVC is based on the difference
		   between total scheduled and the actual delivery at the point.  

	If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.
	<NAME/> Blair (713-853-7637).

I don't know if you got my email, I sent it to the office.  Here's what it said in case....

"Connie --

Actually, they reacted very well - or at least as well as can be expected.  They were sad, but not horrified or anything.  They respect me and know that it's not a choice.  It was just so weird, because I did not have any agenda or intention on telling them that at that point, we were just talking about stuff (and drinking) and I just told them.  And I told them, you can't be totally surprised by this - and they said no.  They had questioned it before, but had not wanted to offend me by asking.  At the same time, they were holding out hope that it wasn't true.  But now they know.  They didn't really have alot of questions or anything, but were just accepting of it.  I'm very happy to have it off my chest.

Sorry to hear about your stomach!!!  That doesn't sound fun at all.  I had a pretty bad hangover yesterday, because I drank profusely before durning and after the whole outing myself to my parents ordeal.

<NAME/>"

So, maybe you already read that.  Anyway, is Armin getting alzheimers???  I don't have any big plans for the weekend.  I actually have a couple of dates, but nothing major.  I've made a couple of new friends, so I want to continue to cultivate those sort of relationships...if other types come up that's fine, but I'm not really concentrating on it.  But I had to go out and tell a couple of my new friends about my revelation to my parents.  A couple of them have not done it themselves, so everybody's all proud of me and stuff.  It's kinda funny really.  But it's like the one thing that was always your biggest concern just isn't there anymore.  I hope it was the right thing to do, but I feel like it was.  Hard to say whether it was good or bad for my mom.  But, honesty is the best policy, right?

<NAME/> and <NAME/>, I met with <NAME/> Berger, Terry Kowalke and Raetta Zadow this morning
	to review yesterday's meeting on the concerns for DDVC's at "small customer delivery points"
	on the southend of NNG's system. Through our discussions, here are a few ideas including some
	of yesterday's discussion.  These ideas may be somewhat out of the norm, but we thought we
	would at least  throw them on the table.

	1.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should agree with us to lift the requirement
	     that the supply has to be upstream of the delivery in the Bushton Universe.  It can still be
	     required in the "Bushton Universe", just not as restrictive as it is today.

	2.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should allow us to do storage true ups
	     at 8:00 a.m. at the end of the gas day to eliminate DDVC.

	3.  If these deliveries are on Firm contracts, can we sell them SMS to cover these small volumes
	     even though they are in the field area?

	4.  Richfield Storage point - (I am not sure it is even active)  -  Could we get Oneok to agree to 
	     allow true ups if we are supplying the true up with gas coming from the Richfield storage point?
	     I am sure this alternative would need to include the storage group.

	We would be glad to participate in any future discussions.  Thanks. <NAME/>

Hi <NAME/>,

<NAME/> you please have someone re-send the confirmation to Dynegy Canada for May 25th and May 31st.  The sitara ticket Number is 761773.  

I trade on a daily basis with Dynegy Canada and I use them to balance on (a good deal for <NAME/>), so their volumes may change several times during the morning trading period.  So as a result, to avoid sending them duplicate confirmations, would it be possible to wait until the afternoon to send their daily confirmations?

If not, no big deal, it would just make less work for everyone concerned.

Thanks

If <NAME/> OKs it I can do a strategy session. That last email from Devil-Pooch made me
yearn for the sight of his blood soiling the field of battle.
The key to <NAME/>'s wins (and I have given it some thought):
1) Quick advancement. He doesn't attack early, I believe it is to build stone walls,
	encompassing a larger area than is proportional for his team. And to seal us off.
2) Large level of resources, enabling him to cue Paladins to build as his army is killed.
	Thus he has a constant wave of attacks. He also builds resources until the point
he decides to attack, then he kills all but maybe 20 villagers. His army is concentrated 
and huge.
3) Build castles on conquered territory.

If we wall a large area, build resource levels quickly, then attack as soon as we each have a
40 man army, with additional soldiers cued. we will win. The use of trebuchets is imperative.
We should have a total of 10 on our team. Towers kill.
AND WE MUST NEVER SIT BACK AND LET HIM REBUILD. Whenever we hang out not attacking,
it's over.

I need some support on this:
For the last two weeks,  Ercot has been giving us OOMC orders.     They have told us to run the plant, without question.     We have asked them whether they mean OOME when we run.    To a man,   the Ercot dispatch guys have said that OOMC means to run, they want the power.     
I have launched three e-mails (requesting clarification)  to <NAME/> Patterson,  starting weeks ago on this issue.    Yesterday,   I caught <NAME/> by phone at 5:30pm.

<NAME/> consulted with his operations group and determined that we had been OOMC'd and we should run,  but they are not going to pay us the hr calc.
They said that OOMC means run and we are supposed to sell this power.     This confusion on our part will prove costly to Frontera as they will be paid the imbalance, instead of the heat rate calc.       We cannot sell in the offpeak hours for greater than $5.      It costs us $26 to generate power.

<NAME/> said " dont worry, at worst case you can file for reimbursement."     <NAME/> also said that we will get paid for the capacity. But what???

It is my opinion that it is no accident that Ercot was vague on this issue.     They want to penalize us if we dont run,  and if we do ,  we will lose money.
We then file to get a break-even rebate.  They are acquiring ancillary reserves for free and not even paying for the energy component.

I realize that these issues will be discussed in the Tuesday meeting and I will provide examples, as requested by Ercot.

I need some support from the protocols and I need some suggestions.   I  do not want to allow these guys to game us anymore.  
We will be more vocal in this meeting.    If no resolution is reached,  I vote for ignoring their OOM instructions.
I need a ruling on whether they can force us to lose money.  

Thanks,

<NAME/>

Yesterday, we went to the beach and rented some horses and went horseback riding,  Kendall loved it, Jordan was a little skeptical at first, but soon got used to the idea.

Narsimha -
Can we get together to discuss how best to serve your retail load?     I think this simple process has been complicated by the number of players involved.
We will give you any structure that you need and provide transparency as to how we do what we do.   What more is there?

I have heard that this could start as early as September,  but we are still a bit short on detail.     If we started in September,  I would envision passing local charges, congestion,   etc to EES.    We would schedule your hedges,  your load and cover any remaining balance (or not) with respect to load zone.
We would provide scheduling services,  settlements and   24 hour coverage to handle any  contingencies that might occur.

I look forward to working with you on this issue.

Everyone is real helpful though, but being put on the spot, its hard to come up with the answers quickly.  It's painful for me....whew!

Talk with you later.......how many days left now?

Love ya

The amendment that I think you're referring to was not signed. We sent it to Starwood and then nothing happened. If you can't find a hard copy, you can call Rell Tipton at V&E and ask him to e-mail you the latest version of the Starwood amendment that he's been working on. If you can't reach Rell, his assistant, <NAME/> Cortinas can probably help. Rell's number is (713)758-4506. <NAME/> this helps.

Stamos, 

Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.

In terms of your email reply,
you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price 
caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In addition
their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are they
going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most 
regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, it's 
going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and <NAME/>
International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go
down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone
out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The politicians
are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute stupidity
of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more focused 
on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think they are incable
of solving the problem.

Group,

Here is the most current information regarding charges from the CAISO, the FERC Ruling and the Price Cap.

1.  The current price cap is $91.87.  We should continue our practice of not selling over the cap, however we can (and should) buy over the cap if necessary for the system reliability of our service customers.

2.  The FERC order specifies a penalty of $100 per mw for underscheduling load (greater than 5% per load zone underscheduled).  Despite the CAISO's repeated protests (and the IOU's complete disregard of this order), WE can expect to be subject to this penalty.

3.  When a WARNING is in effect the CAISO will be making out-of -market calls.  These OOM calls will not show up in the expost or beep stack.  Therefore when power supplies become tight, the prices in the "expost" may actually drop.  We should continue our practice of NOT leaving uninstructed energy in the CAISO whenever possible.

4.  We should continue to participate in the CAISO congestion market.  The CAISO frequently has unexpected hourly path loadings, and congestion has occurred in the hour ahead market that was not present in the day ahead market.

5.  Remember to include CAISO export fees, Tie Meter Multipliers/import fees and grid management fees in your CAISO calculations of wheeling charges.



We will have a real-time meeting on Monday July 9th at 4:30 PM in Mt. Hood.  We will discuss other changes in the market at that time.  Please make plans to attend.
Thank you,
<NAME/>

As we have more and more cuts, we have an excellant opportunity to refine our cut technique. (YES!)

 1.) In path confirmation workspace-please check all cut paths as "confirmed" (this will allow us to sort for cut or "confirmed" paths later)-and enter notes in the comment section regarding the cut.

2.) ZERO OUT CUT SCHEDULES IN DEAL SCHEDULING. On imports to CALI, please zero out the purchase outside of CALI, zero out the EpmiCalPool, and then make a purchase under the book that had the import (likely EPMI Short Term Cali) from the California Imbalance (remember no price and 24 POS on the group).

IF you have any questions, please call me. We are having a nightmare taking care of weekend cuts, particularly imports into California.

I forgot Leigh <NAME/> was going to be in town this weekend.  As for this evening, I think we're still on.  The movie is showing at the Angelika at 7:40 or Greenway 3 at 10:00...I'm assuming both of us would prefer the earlier movie, but there is something to be said for proximity.  What are your thoughts?  We could either take our time with dinner and then do the movie or just go to the early show and maybe grab dessert afterwards.  My guess is <NAME/> would probably prefer the earlier time, since she may be taking off early tomorrow.

1) For a full requirements deal, I would like some sense of the load shape of the customer.  Having just monthly total energy consumption is not enough to price a deal.

		I would like for that back up to be someone that was NOT on
		your original team.  This may help us address the issue of the two
		"old" teams merging.

		For example I am assuming if one rep has the shipper business and another rep has the
		operator business for the same company, then those two reps should back each other's
		desk.

		Randy Janzen is backing up <NAME/> Adams desk on <NAME/> Power Plant since he has AEP which
			is shipper that does business at the <NAME/> Plant.

		<NAME/> and <NAME/> support each other's desk since <NAME/> has ElPaso as a Shipper and
			<NAME/> has ElPaso as Operator.

		<NAME/> and Joe support each other on Oneok since <NAME/> has Bushton and Joe has the
			gathering

		The areas of concern in relation to day to day business are below and need specific back up
		reps. 

			GPM Monthly Pricing Report
			<NAME/> Power Plant True Ups
			PVR Report
			Oneok Gathering Reporting
			NNG Administrative Contracts
			SPS Power Plant True Up
			Conoco Power Plant True Up
			MOPS Daily Report
				
		The HIgh profile shippers/Operators that need specific back ups are as follows:

http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/11/05/gen.attack.on.terror/index.html


CNN) -- Seven airport security workers have been suspended after police said a man made it through a security checkpoint at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport with knives, a can of Mace and a stun gun. 
Security screeners took two knives from Subash Gurung, 27, after he initially went through the checkpoint Saturday night, authorities said. Gurung then was allowed to pass through. Seven more knives, Mace and a stun gun were found in his carry-on luggage during a random search before boarding a United Airlines flight, police said. 
The suspect, who told authorities he is from Nepal, was arrested Sunday night by the FBI and will be arraigned Monday on a federal charge of unlawfully taking a weapon aboard an aircraft. He originally had been arrested Saturday by local police, charged with two misdemeanors and released on bond. 
CNN has learned of a possible connection between Gurung and a man who is being held as a material witness in the September 11 terrorist attacks. Gurung listed the same West Hollywood Avenue address in Chicago as the detainee. (Full story </2001/US/11/05/inv.ohare.security.breach/index.html>) 
In the U.S.-led retaliation for the terror attacks, Taliban forces were leaving their southern Afghan stronghold of Kandahar on Monday as U.S.-led airstrikes intensified. 
After a quiet day Sunday -- allied planes dropped a single bomb southeast of the city -- CNN's Kamal Hyder reported heavy bombardment of rural districts around Kandahar as well as military targets to the northeast, southeast and west. 
There were reports of further attacks overnight on the Kajaki Dam area, where a hydroelectric plant is located that provides power to Kandahar. 
Taliban frontline positions north of Kabul also were hit Monday, and there were reports of intense fighting near the strategic northern city of Mazar-e Sharif.

Hey...

so i've given everyone the heads up around here regarding my decision, and surprisingly enough they have been on the whole very supportive.  <NAME/> told me this was a "good thing" for me and that he was jealous.  And <NAME/> actually said he was proud of me.  anyway, it's gone much better than i had expected.  still don't know exactly what happens to me now.  so we shall see what the next weeks hold in store.  

i'm still checking into lodging etc. for this weekend/early next week.  i can fly in saturday or sunday, but maybe sunday morning would be best.  i figure we could touch base and plan the next couple days (plus, i wouldn't have kept you up all night chatting saturday night so that you're exhausted for work sunday).  then we'd have all day monday and tuesday and i'd probably fly back on wednesday....just a thought, feel free to share you own.

drop me a line when you get a chance,
<NAME/>....finally living up the name!

Hey,

I just figures something out.  The only email messages that you are getting, from me, are the ones where I am replying to you.  This is due to I had your email address as shannontyer@msn.net, however, I noticed that your return email address is shannontyer@email.msn.com.

We are about to transition to UBS Warburg, hopefully next week.  The whole thing is a pain in the ass, but, I think that it will have very lucrative returns in the future!


So what's been goin' on?  You never returned my call last week.  How's the B&B project?  I heard supper with R & S & R & M went well, except for you having some G.I. problems.  Drop me a line or call if you want to catch a movie or grab  supper some time.

Here is a recap of what happened for April 1st.  

NCPA, scheduling coordinator for City of Oakland called 3/30 and 3/31 regarding the 5MW flat schedule we sold to them at NP15.  They informed me that the subject contract is terminated and therefore will not submit it through ISO.  I called Mo and <NAME/> and they informed that the contract is still valid and therefore keep the schedule in.  ISO called 3/31 A.M and informed me NCPA and <NAME/> will have to settle it.  <NAME/> called NCPA and they agreed to put in the 5MW schedule for April 1.  For April 2nd and through the end of the month, we will not submit the 5MW until we hear different from legal.

<NAME/>,

the pipeline maps I found are worth looking at. They don't cost much ($950 for paper version and $795 for CD rom version) for both US and Canada. I think that CD-ROM version is a better bet: you can zoom in and out and you can print the parts you need. The real value is that they show every interconnect with every facility (power plants, industrials, even prisons:).

I think that it is something that would help us look into details when we approach different regions, and I think basis traders would appreciate it too.

Sample map of Montana is attached.

Enpower Preschedule Workspace and Path Confirmation

Please note we have two new Enpower applications currently in use by the Prescheduling Group that are also available for Real Time use. A manual has been placed in your inbox describing the process in detail. You will be using this in place of Lotus Notes to confirm and process cut power schedules going forward. You must check out with all major marketers and utilities each night. This would include but not be limited to: AEP, AES-New Energy, Aquila, Avista, Calpine, Constellation, Coral, <NAME/>, Dynegy, El Paso Merchant, Exelon, Meico, Mirant, Morgan, NCPA, Reliant, PPLMontana, PowerX, Sempra, SMUD, TransAlta, <NAME/>, and southwest utilities such as Pinnacle West, SRP, PNM, PSCO and Pacificorp. Northwest counterparties are checked out by BPA and do not need to be checked again by us (this would include SCL, TCL, PSPL, BPAP, GCPUD, EWEB, IPC, MPC, SNPD, WWP). These checkouts should be started in HE 19 and finished by HE 21. 

NOTE: You must open both PSW and Path Confirmation from your local Enpower Launchpad, which can be found under the Start Menu in Programs/Business Applications/Enpower/Enpower Login. 

Following are a few pointers to help you get started. 

1.	All prescheduled power paths will be loaded into Path Confirmation. This application must be opened from local Enpower and can be found in the menu that drops down from the hand icon at the left under "Tools."
2.	A box will appear asking you to select a default trading desk. Choose "West" and click "Okay."
3.	Supply schedules are shown in gray, transmission in yellow, and market in blue.
4.	Sort paths by clicking and dragging on the heading you'd like to sort by. Suggestion: Sort by counterparty while making confirmation calls. When all schedules with that counterparty are confirmed, highlight each schedule
5.	Highlight the path you'd like to confirm or cut by clicking in the thin box to the very left of the Path Confirmation screen. Highlight multiple rows by holding the "Control" button and while selecting multiple rows.
6.	Confirm a path by highlighting and clicking the telephone icon. A screen will come up requesting contact information from the appropriate counterparty. Because this information saves directly to Enpower, save time runs about a minute.
7.	Cut a path by highlighting and clicking the scissors icon. A screen called "Cut Information" will come up. Select the "New Path Cut" icon in the upper left-hand corner and supply the relevant information (region, cut time, resupply path, Enpower numbers, Turret ID, etc.)
8.	Double click anywhere in a particular row to see a detail of that schedule. This screen will show the terms and hours of the deal as well as volume, price, Enpower deal and OATI tag number.

Lotus Notes is being phased out of operation, and we are working with the Enpower team in <NAME/> to develop a discussion database similar to the one we currently use in Notes. These new applications will be a part of that, so please begin adjusting your nightly schedule checkout and/or cuts procedure accordingly (i.e. Record cut paths in Enpower Path Confirmation, not Lotus Notes.)

Hi <NAME/>
 
 
Good to hear from you.  I am glad to hear things are going well. This consolidation in the markets and the economy has been quite severe. I can tell you it has not been fun working with a 50 multiple company either as the p/e contracts to 7.  But nevertheless this had been interesting times.  
 
We ramped down DealBench in good time. It was a good decision and precipitated some good thinking. Practically, everyone moved out of ecommerce. Its just crazy when you think how things were 18 months ago. . Power trading has been immensely interesting. I am running the options desk and we have had a decent year.  Energy trading is fascinating and coupled with my macro background from bond trading,it becomes lot of fun.

I have heard that MPC has contracted with Avista to do their load balancing. Has anyone contacted MPC to discuss continuing or renewing our relationship with them in the future. MPC is likely month-to-month with Avista as they were with us. Has there been any progress with EPE? What are your expectations for retaining them? Of all our service customers these would be the only two I am truly concerned about getting back. I think we have seen significant revenue from both, more because of the information they provide then because of the fee structures.

I have attached an indicative terms sheet for full-requirements gas supply.  It is similar to the initial proposal that I have made to other municipalities in northern California.  However, many changes were made and negotiated based on several factors.  Some of those factors include the types of customers behind your city gate (residential, power generation), what your load profile is correlated to (weather), transport owned, and other services requested.  Also, the type of pricing you are looking for can affect the structure.  Call me on Tuesday and we can talk about the City of Roseville more specifically.  (I will be out Monday)

Have a great weekend!  I hope this is helpful.

Group,

We have developed a process for tiering our bids and should do so going forward.

Please use appropriate dollar and mw values. Below is JUST an example. When tiering, the top numbers (mw values) must be monotonically increasing and the last two numbers on the bottom of your tier ($ values) must be the same.

	 
IMPORT:	0	25	50	75	100	125	150	200	200.01
		$49	$49	$74	99	149	174	199	249	249


EXPORT:	0	25	50	75	100	125	150	200	200.01
		$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1


*NOTE* If a tiered bid is entered incorrectly you will have to flow a large amount of mws for loss or no gain.*NOTE*

Please see me with any questions before implementing tiered bids.

Thanks,

Chobs:
Sorry it took so long to respond, but its been crazy around here.  Both KMI and KMP are still good buys, its just the overall market environment thats bringing these down.  Also, the commodities prices in gas and crude and fuel oil have come off quite a bit, which makes the general investors worry about the future earnings potential of the companies.  They are locked into contracts at a very good price, so whether the price of the commodity goes up or down they still make their cash flow targets.  Remember, the CEO of the company has a stack of over 25% of the company, so he is very tied to the overall stock price.  Enough said, invest your money into KMI and KMP, especially KMP since it has that yield of around 7%.  Talk to you soon.

For all cuts the following procedures apply...

1.) Notes as usual

2.) In the Enpower Path Confirmation, we need to make cuts as Path Confirms. Enter comments in the confirmed section. We will be zeroing Enpower deals out on Monday (hint: NOTES are VERY important--All CUTS must be notated and the notes must be put in the accordion folders).

3.) Try to have the counterparties continue any paths around us. Just "bow out" gracefully if you have no other options with the words "L - D's."

4.) If we are cut by a generator/utility going into California, we must call the HA desk at California and tell them the increment that we will be underscheduling our load by. For example, EPE will be cutting all schedules going into California on light load (100 mws). If we cannot resupply the schedules we need to tell the state that we are underscheduling our load by 100 mws. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. We have posted an LC with Cali for this reason.

Also, EPE will be long RT 100 mws off-peak as they are no longer selling to us. 25 mws should be sold to TEP to cover a forward schedule. Stacy has set this up at PV. Please do this as a direct bill with EPE. As of Jan 01, 2002 we will no longer be marketing for EPE. Also, PV#3 will be coming off this weekend, and FC#4 will be down from HE 22 on Saturday through HE 06 on Sunday.

This will probably not be a fun weekend. 
I appreciate your help.

Hi <NAME/>,

Just a note to recap our recent and ongoing discussions regarding the disposition of the Heartland Steel and CSN agreements:

At this point, <NAME/>'s Legal Department has requested documentation from CSN that substantiates the fact that CSN did purchase Heartland Steel.  I have contacted your legal counsel, Mr. Tarter, and obtained information that will hopefully satisfy <NAME/>'s request.  The next step for me is to meet with my legal staff on Monday, October 15, 2001 to determine the following:

1) Is the relationship between Heartland Steel and <NAME/> completely severed?

2) Do we come up with a brand new pricing and deal structure with CSN, or does the existing structure with Heartland Steel remain in place?

Once, these determinations have been made, we'll follow up with the necessary legal documents.

I'm hoping to have resolution to these entire process by early next week.

Talk to you then.


P.S. As a notional indicator, November, 2001 pricing for Chicago city gate delivered volume (which is comparable to your location) would be estimated at NYMEX (currently $2.41) plus approximately $0.10.

Please keep in mind that the NYMEX price changes on a second-by-second basis, and this will impact your price.

Girl, what is PMO?  I'm doing fine, I just sent <NAME/> an e-mail, and I hit the send button and there you are!  Is everything going as planned in all of your wedding preparations?  I certainly hope so.  I know planning a wedding is alot of work.  Jordan is still excited about walking with Taylor.

I had a good time with my boys this weekend.  They are crazy.  We went to the dreaded "Chuckee Cheese" this weekend and oh boy, was I ever glad to get out of there.  After that, we went  to the Galleria, because when I was there before without them, I saw a shoe store that had really cute, fashionable shoes for little boys.  What I didn't realize was that they were designer shoes.  Who ever heard of <NAME/> <NAME/> shoes for little boys.  $65 a pair for the kind that I liked.  But since I was there, I said, what the heck?  After about 20 minutes, we had been waited on, but still neither one of my boys had even tried on a pair of shoes yet, let alone buying a pair (the sales folks were truly taking their sweet time).  I was pissed and me and my possee (Jordan and Kendall) almost "set if off" at the Galleria.  We just left after I told them that their service was unacceptable.  Anyway, don't mess with Moma Thurston.

Group,

Our deal with EES has changed. As Ryan indicated in his email we are now charging $3 for EES up to 100 mws, above 100 mws to  200 mws we are charging $4, above 200 mws per hour we are charging $5.  However, when we have transacted with EES for a peaker product or day-ahead schedule we will not integrate our fee into their price for that quanity of mws. I will indicate in an email to you when this occurs. This is a bit complex but if you have questions just let me know.

Also, EnMax has recently been buying energy from us at the BC Border. This turned out to be a "Canadian" firm purchase on the part of Enmax. Please do not fill any sale to EnMax with MPC energy. We need to treat EnMax just like ECC. We should buy an option or a call and then exercise that option. MPC does not have this capability and should not be used in this manner.

Finally, the NW evening peak has arrived. The NW has been extremely tight through morning and evening peaks, often over $30 to pick up...

Any questions, just let me know.

Thanks,

yeah,  the Offense was very unhuskerlike, except for Crouch, He had 150 yards passing which was fairly good.  The line was not ready for such an aggressive D this early.  I do think TCU has a great Defense as evidenced by their #1 Defense ranking last year. Evidently they had some depth as well becasue they lost half of their starters to Graduation/NFL.  The bright spot was the Defense giving up only 165 yards of TOTal yards.  their only score came on a broken play that went for 67yards.  We were also lucky that Casey Printers pulled a muscle on that play.  We played 2 true freshman alot on the D and they were very good.  The D should be faster and more aggressive than last year.  The Domers think they have a chance now that we only scored 21 on TCU.  I say TCU is better than people think, but I'm glad we didn't open with NotreDame.  I got your pictures.  Your daughter is really cute.

Kayne and Rahil,

Please give this term sheet a look and advise of any changes you think might be necessary.  For instance, it gives the delivery point as the CPL/Cogentrix border, and not the bb of the facility as Kayne suggested.  I am drafting off of the term sheet, so your input is very important.

I need the name of the generation facility and approximate number of megawatts we will be marketing for them.  Also, are we still planning on dealing with some PPA's they have?  If so, what will our involvement be and how many more megawatts are involved?

Are we only going to pay Cogentrix after we have received payment from the third party?  If they fail to remit other costs (transmission, for instance), I presume we will want to deduct that from what we owe them.  What other costs might we need to be reimbursed for?  What are Resource Costs?

How often will we email or fax them a sales summary? <NAME/> we be reporting to whom each delivery of power was sold?

<NAME/>, please confirm that Credit will not be requiring any particular language, etc in this deal since we aren't using an EEI.

Wait just a minute.  <NAME/>'t Goodell and I get a wedding invite?  Maybe we want to give you an expensive gift!  YEAH RIGHT!!!!!!   We are poorer than college students now.  I think you should send us an invite anyway.  Maybe I could make a bachelor party out of it.  At least I could get drunk.  So do you have all that wedding crap stuff done or is your MAN taking care of all that?  I always heard that it was WOMAN's work anyway.  

Those are fantastic grades.  You would have to ADD my old college grades together to get a 3.83, and I still think it would be a struggle.  I know you told me but I can't remember, whets is your major?  MBA?

Its good to hear about <NAME/>.  Is she going to grad school?

I don't know when me and my very pregnant girlfriend are getting married.  We move in together at the end of Feb.  I'm nervous about that.  I've been living alone since '97 and I just don't know why all you foolish people want to get married and live together.  I took some digital photo's of her yesterday.  I'll let you know if I get them on the web so you can take a look and make fun of me being a 40 year old father to be.

I exercised my options today...for various reasons.

First: stock moved around 1.3 yesterday and was up as high as 1.5 today...now on its way back down.  I exercised when it was 1.0 up....i really felt that this was more a peak for now than a trend up.

Also, the move yesterday I feel was influenced by news that we were selling our <NAME/> power plant....this is the 2nd news story related to enron selling assets (Portland General) and reducing workforce (<NAME/> Europe laying off employees).  Yesterday there was an article that was released stating that there may be some difficulty getting the <NAME/> deal to go through....hence...me feeling like this thing was probably going to move back down.

Also, the employee survey results I read.....not good...enron employee "consumer" confidence is not good.  Not to mention the fact that I see many of my peers getting solicited w/ big bucks to work elsewhere and the volatile trading environment (hence $$$$$ for enron) slowly dissapating.

Lastly....I can always buy enron stock .....at these price levels...taking 3500 bucks and throwing it in the bank..is probably easy money....I can always take the money market and get back in enron....sure I am forgoing getting in at 28.5 (the strike price) but the difference between that and getting in at lets say 40....is a few thousand dollars....rather forgo that and get back in on a definite uptrend...then risk losing this easy money and have nothing to show.

OH...lastly..I am still in EOG which will move in sympathy w/ ENE if that market continues to trend up.

So there you go....the most detailed trade report i think i've ever written.
Talk to you later hun

<NAME/>,

I have one question on this month's PMA and some questions from last month.  First, for deal #549162, this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp.  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit.  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue?  Are we being charged for each counterparty again (like EES and ST-Cali last month), if so, we need to fix this flawed tool. 

Second, for last month, we determined that the WBOM book needs a $108,000 PMA for change in price.  The appropriate price is in Enpower, but the revenue has never appeared (Deal #590753). Remember, this deal was originally input as a buy at $320 and a sell at $30 and liquidated at these prices. The deal is now at $320 and $300.  What do we need to do to get this trued up?
Please come see me with questions.

Thank you for your help.

Put <NAME/> down as 100%.  He's in San <NAME/> this weekend with his visiting brothers and unfortunately, his contract is here in <NAME/>.  I talked to him last night and he had <NAME/> Sloan fax his doc to the hotel and he assured me he'd review it then or first thing this a.m.  I'm sure he'll find the language acceptable since it's merely a 30-day evergreen.  As for additional $'s, I personally guaranteed him $10k and gave him 50-50 odds on the 1-year contract we talked about yesterday.  He's in either way.
 
 I also called Suarez yesterday and left a message, but haven't heard back yet.  I'll lob another call in this morning around 10am.

I know that there is South to North congestion,   but is this actual load right?    Is interruptible load being curtailed due to the congestion or is their rain somewhere that isnt showing on our weathermap?

Group,

Going forward we will be delivering parking or taking lending energy at one point per schedule with Portland General. We will either deliver or take energy from them at Portland General System. OR we will deliver or take energy from them at Mid-C. 

PGE real-time has had difficulty with scheduling the energy in real-time to or from a point other than originally prescheduled. Therefore ONLY schedule the energy to or from the originally prescheduled delivery point. In the case below we would deliver the energy to Portland General System--NOT the MID-C.

We should continue to be flexible at PGE's request. Please see me with any questions.

Funny you should ask about my life right now.  Now you are sure to get an earful!  Beware - My country is at war and going into a major recession, my company is falling down around my feet, my grandmother is sick,  I am broke, and my boyfriend broke up with me last week, further confirming my ability to fail when it comes to relationships.  ( I know I act tought when it comes to this stuff but I am really sad about this one)  I guess that I am not sick and I do have lots of friends.  But I am tired and need someone to take over at this point - - - - 

I can't believe that you didn't get my email about gas being a buy a couple of weeks ago.  I guess if I had seen you when I was there, I could have told you in person.  AS for business over here, gas and power trading is still going strong.  However, all of the events have affected us in a huge way financially.  Down to whether we get bonuses or not.  It is not going to be a good year just trying to stay strong but I think that we will survive, and mostly thanks to EnronOnline.

Curious about what's going on there since you mentioned it.  Anyway - sorry to burden you with my personal problems.  I do hope things are going ok for you - too bad you're not going to make it here.  As we are in a cash crunch, I think I am probobly grounded for the remainder of the year.  Who knows!

Keep in touch -

Stacy,

I just extended a deal with the City of Pasadena for September.  The previous deal was for April thru August and the confirm was prepared by <NAME/> Hyvl.  Could you help me prepare the confirm for the extension?  The term sheet is attached as there are minor changes.  Please let me know if you have any questions or if you are unable to work on this for me.

Thanks,

Hey what's Happening?

Just wanted to let you know that today is my Birthday!

We're going yo go to the KiCi and <NAME/> <NAME/> Concert tonight at the Arena Theater,  should be very good!

Also, did you hear from Robin that <NAME/>'s daughter, Dana, is in the hospital, I'm going to call up there this afternoon and see how she's doing.  I'm assuming her last name is Brown.

Also, I hooked <NAME/> Patterson up with one of my customers (A divorced brother from S. <NAME/>).  Girlm she called me this morning, and she was so giddy.  She said they really had a good time talking on the phone, they talked two hours.  They are meeting for lunch on tomorrow.  I'll be anxious to hear what he thinks of her after meeting her.  I know she'll like him, because he is a nice looking brother, and nice conversation.  I just hope he thinks she's cute.

Oh well, talk to you later.
