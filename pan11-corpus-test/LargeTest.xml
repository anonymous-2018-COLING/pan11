Sorry, I didn't see the questions below.

We were using historical rates (no fuel adjustment because we collect it in fuel sales) through 2006.  After 2006, I calculated an adjustment to add to the historical rates (assuming that we would recapture some of the value of the spread in the rate) and it made the rate greater than the max tariff rate.  <NAME/> and I discussed that we didn't think we should assume anything in the models over max rate, so <NAME/> said he would use the max rate after 2006.  (All of this is just pertaining to the West rates.)

The historical average West rate is $.2565.  The historical West rate with fuel adjustment added is $.3404.  The max rate is $.2868.

It's the same thing someone commented below (in blue) in response to the question - "if we are at average rates we would be able to get it  back (fuel over-retention) up to the max rate number."

I know it's hard to think about work issues much less concentrate, but it seems to me we need to start thinking about market disruption issues right away.

I didn't think about it from your point of view and if some day I decide not to help anymore then you get hurt because your contribution falls.  So just disregard that suggestion.

We are long for these two hours tonight.  Please sell this length at Palo and notify IID of the schedule.  They are aware that it is going real time.

Per our phone conversation <NAME/> agrees to buy back 21,417/d at Carthage for December at IFGMR HSC index - .08.  I have also talked to EPrime who is our supplier and they are buying back this 21,417/d from <NAME/> at IFGMR HSC - .08.  They will subsequently sell the gas to Woodward directly at IFGMR HSC - .08.  Both EPrime and Woodward agree that HSC - .08 is a fair market value for Carthage volumes during bidweek for December.  The purpose of this transaction is to mitigate the risk of physical non-performance by <NAME/> given our current financial condition without impacting the contractual pricing of the deals previously done with Eprime and Woodward respectively.

Hey <NAME/>,

Long time no hear.  How are things at Harvard?  I trust you had a good holiday period.  Are you still in Kentucky or back in Boston?
How was the first round of finals?

Things are good down here.  I stayed in <NAME/> for the holidays.  I still have a job.  The big date for us (in the trading group) is this Friday. That is when the bankruptcy court decides who is the best bidder for the trading group.  Hopefully we will get back to work sometime soon after that.

I will be out of the office on Wednesday, March 28.  I will be in <NAME/> interviewing 1st year MBA students for the <NAME/> Scholarships.  This will be the third year that <NAME/> will give two to three $10,000 scholarships to top MBA students for use in their second year in business school.  It's great PR for <NAME/> on campus (largest MBA scholarships given) and it has helped in our recruiting efforts as well.

State PUC seeks to void <NAME/>'s power contracts 
Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators 
In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray <NAME/>. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. 
"The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated," Commissioner <NAME/> Bilas said. "I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down." 
The PUC apparently did not tell <NAME/> administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
"It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us," said <NAME/> Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. 
Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. 
"It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out," Hidalgo said. "If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up." 
The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. 
Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. 
Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance <NAME/> LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney <NAME/> Gallagher. 
SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS
Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the <NAME/> administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. 
The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of <NAME/>' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. 
Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. 
<NAME/>' spokesman <NAME/> Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. 
The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between <NAME/> and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. 
The commission has rebuffed <NAME/>' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. 
STATE TREASURER'S WARNING
State Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. 
PUC President <NAME/> Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. 
"We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years," Lynch said last week. "We should stay as flexible as possible. 
Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. 
Commissioner <NAME/> Brown, Lynch's fellow <NAME/> appointee, said the filings don't rule out <NAME/>' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. 
"The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract," he said. "Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract." 
Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. 
Jan <NAME/>, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. 
"Now another California agency is disputing it," <NAME/> said. "We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored." 
PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS
The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. 
"News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers," the PUC said. 
An energy consultant to <NAME/>, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. 
Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, <NAME/>' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California <NAME/>'s finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. 
While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation.

<NAME/>,
 
I am glad you sent me this message. It will help to clarify a few issues.
 
1. I was contacted by <NAME/> (this means I did not start this phase of the process)
    last Friday, as far as I can remember.
 
    <NAME/> expressed interest in joining the Research Group. I told him two things:
       a. We would be delighted to have him here.
       b. Our mutual relationship and good practices require that he receives
           your blessing before we can move ahead.
    We agreed to have a conference call Wed morning, your time, with you, <NAME/> and
    <NAME/> Roberts.
 
  2. Wednesday call was subsequently cancelled by <NAME/>. <NAME/> and I decided to call you
      anyway Thu morning your time, directly, to discuss the matter. I was in a PRC all afternoon and 
      asked <NAME/> to call you  in case I could not sneak out to join him. <NAME/> called and was
      told you were out sick.
 
 3. I am leaving in a few hours for California. I shall be driving back to <NAME/> for the next
     3 days. Please, feel free to call <NAME/> an discuss this matter with  him in my absence.
 
 4. I think <NAME/> has a strong preference to be in the Research Group, assuming he moves to
     <NAME/>. I think he came to this conclusion after visiting <NAME/> in early July. I did not 
     bring up the issue of transfer with him at all when he was here.
 
     I can  understand his motivation and think we should take his preferences into account. But the
     first  issue is if he can leave Sydney at all.
 
I hope it helps. Cheers.

The other thing that I am thinking is that we don't want to file anything at the FERC without a broad coalition.  At the right time (after we understand the facts and our desired outcomes), let's sit down and discuss how to approach FERC.  I think the timing is right to make a cogent, well-defined argument before FERC but we need to sell this to the FERC before the filing and we need to have <NAME/> as a minor player in the fight.

<NAME/>... seems like its been a while since we met in San Fransisco, ....  and of course so much has happened since then. 

I have been talking with our in house legal and with Canada and I know <NAME/> and yourself have also been talking. I believe that the door has been pushed open a little and if everyone tries to get these agreements cleaned up  and executed that PG&E and <NAME/> ( Canada & US ) can start to transact.

With that being said, there are two areas which I would like to refresh from our discussions..

1.  Did you give any further thought to the utilization of Daily gas sales as a collateral.. I truly believe that this vehicle is a very efficient,easy way for PG&E to enhance the credit with ENA and once we have a 30 day bucket... we can get you trading access to EOL.  Lot's of details to work out, but I would like to keep this discussion at the forefront. I can send the details of how this proposal would work if required. ( let me know ) 

2.  As discussed, ENA holds some 5 year El Paso capacity. I am looking to assign this capacity and possibly and would like to investigate your supply requirements and possible alternatives such that you can consider our capacity.  

I trust all is well and look forward to talking to you soon.

I have no good thoughts about the market.  everybody wants it to go down to 2.80 so I covered my short at 310-5.  cash very strong at these lower levels with some gen load.  should act to flatten curve as good producer selling in back.  playing range and selling vol.  think aga may surprise lower than expectations.

With Calger leading the likes of Parquet etc they can make $100mm plus - without him no chance.  I think it's sort of indirect p&l.
 
I think we are close enough I'd put our top 20 above any group - our final ten are really strong too.  <NAME/>, <NAME/> and Zipper as the last people on our list really does show we have some major talent.

Talked to <NAME/> Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if <NAME/> will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
<NAME/> pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: <NAME/> pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against <NAME/> at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of <NAME/>'s undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that <NAME/> should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  <NAME/> expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told <NAME/> that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told <NAME/> that if <NAME/> agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with <NAME/>'s reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on <NAME/>'s proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While <NAME/> seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail <NAME/> out next week.  In which case, <NAME/> could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) <NAME/>'s proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider <NAME/>'s proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

Best,
<NAME/>

You have mentioned several times that we would talk about the organization to support wholesale, but the opportuntity to do so hasn't materialized.  We have had meetings about specific issues, but have not generally discussed how we will manage the Estate going forward.  What role do you envision that I will play?  Can you make time to discuss that on Monday?

 I have talked with Delainey about providing infrastructure for NewCo, and had independently come to the conclusion that we must manage mid and back office for all estate activities (liquidating activities and building activities) in one group to provide the best coverage and flexibility for resources.   With the still anticipated spin-off of Netco, I have created a plan to reorganize the operations teams' efforts.

it is so good to finally get one of these state of the unions again.  i don't know if i can speak for everyone, but i sure have missed it.    it is just good to read all the smart, witty humor again.  i especially thought the part about screaming "who let the dogs out" was quite funny.  it makes it especially funny b/c the employees play along instead of yelling out "shut up nerd".   as most of you know chad and i no longer live together.  it was real tough to see him go b/c we are pretty close, but not as close as maziarz and i evidently are.  but every now and then i still get reminders that i used to live with chad  like the other day when i was vacuming.  i decided to vacum behind the couch b/c i had never cleand back there.  when i looked behind the couch the floor was littered with about 50 toenails.    at first i was pretty freaked out and i was thinking how could these toenails possibly get here?  but then i remembered i use to live with chad and he had a nasty habit of pulling off his toenails.  i should have figured that he didn't dispose of them properly.  it is good to see that chad has figured out how to use the email system again.  last week enron sent out a company wide email and our boy chad replied back to the whole company.  i felt pretty embarrassed for him after he sent the first reply, but went he replied to the whole company a second time i just thought that he was an idiot.  now he will be known as the guy who replied not once but twice to a company wide email.  well, i sure am looking foward to the next state of the union.  i know i will since i am going to vegas to spend all my money at the strip clubs.

Here are the quotes from the Moorings.  One is for a 464 which is about the size of boat we had last time but with 4 cabins and 2 heads (last time was 3 cabins, 3 heads which would be better for a smaller group but they're already booked).  The other is for a 505, a 50' boat with four main cabins, each with its own head, and a fifth smaller cabin in the forepeak.  If we have need for the fourth cabin, I'd be inclined to go with the larger boat.  I talked to <NAME/> on Friday and he's thinking about it - wanted to check his calendar, etc.  Any idea how to get in touch with the Johns?  Other potential sailors to suggest?

LeMetrice is either a director or senior director under <NAME/> - kind of a second in command.  She worked extensively on the original 2002 budget for Infrastructure and put together some data on functions within the Infrastructure group that gave a somewhat layman's explanation of the various services provided.   We have already gone through the process of rebudgeting dollars and headcount for 2002, post bankruptcy and December 2 lay offs, and with the projected Netco spin off.

No one should want to harm the Canadian working for the Swiss company.

Actually, my division was sold to UBS so the transition should not be that hard.  Mostly the same people, but on a much smaller scale.

Thanks for the informative phone call this morning.  Having the key issues presented in one place was very helpful.

To follow up on the meeting, the following are action items for the group.

1.	December 1 Market Readiness Update Meeting

Thane Twiggs (wholesale) and <NAME/> Hetrick (retail) will have at this time an understanding of the billing and settlement issues (or not) with their respective areas.  We need to ensure that EES and EPMI are able to get the necessary information to make sure that their bills and settlements are working and that we can bill our retail customers.  I will ask <NAME/> Noske to set up this meeting.  If anyone hears anything else about the market delay, please let <NAME/> Ryall know immediately.  As of right now, it is my impression that we all agree there is no delay scheduled???

2.	Congestion Pass thru to EES' Retail Customers

Thane Twiggs, <NAME/> Hetrick and <NAME/> Steffes will get with EWS and EES counter parties to try and work through the ability of EES passing thru congestion to its customers per the contract language.  I will lead the process of consulting with EES legal.

3.	Wholesale Issues (Thane Twiggs)

a.	Define workable TCR Product 
b.	End Balanced Schedule requirement 
c.	Fix Capacity Auction process, including credit matters
d.	BENA/OOM/AS
e.	Settlement & Billing

4.	Retail Issues

a.	REP - ISO - Utility Interface (<NAME/> Hetrick)
b.	Reliant PTB (<NAME/> Keene)
c.	TXU PTB (<NAME/> Keene)
d.	Reliant Negative CTC (<NAME/> Keene)
e.	TXU Negative CTC (<NAME/> Keene)
f.	EES / EPMI License (<NAME/> Ogenyi + <NAME/> Hetrick)

5.	Information Flow

All policy statements from anyone within Government Affairs should be first vetted with <NAME/> Ryall to ensure consistency and conformity.  Also, all people on the TO: list above should be included on all e-mail traffic.  I know this may sometimes slow down response to business people, but I think that we can all agree that no one has all the information in this very fast moving environment and unless we have a central clearinghouse we may send the wrong messages.

It is also critical that all commercial people interested in Texas need to hear about the latest.  By having <NAME/> Ryall in the center, she will be able to ensure that no one feels "cut out".

The bi-weekly meeting should be held with <NAME/> Ryall as Host to follow these issues in a timely manner.  

6.	Wholesale Products

Thane Twiggs was going to keep the team apprised of our products and pricing info on a regular basis so we are informed about the market.

Finally, it is critical that everyone work together to get the best results possible for <NAME/> in the Texas market.  This is our "home" base - we need to make sure that our business efforts win big.  

Thanks for everything ya'll have been doing to achieve this result.

The options are not valued properly.   The market value is calculated based upon the value of the underlying, which grossly overstates the market value of the portfolio.  The restricted stock (basis of $0) is valued OK, but the options are not.

In addition, the year restricted stock and option grant is not yet in the portfolio.

Following is a brief description of the EnronOnline contractual framework and copies of the proposed ETA and PA, which have been revised from the initial EnronOnline versions to reflect experience of the last two years.  Hopefully this will assist the meeting on Monday morning.

Contracts Structure

There are three key documents that create the contractual environment for NetcoOnline: the 'Password Application' (PA), the 'Electronic Trading Agreement' (ETA) and the commodity contracts in the form of 'General Terms and Conditions' (GTCs) (or, alternatively, a Master Agreement). The PA is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer. The other documents are accepted online.


PassWord Application (PA)

The PA is a one-page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty (as opposed to any of the other documents, which are accepted online by clicking acceptance). The PA is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the ETA and the GTCs.  

The PA, signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company, and approved by Netco, allows the customer to obtain a Master User ID. The Master User will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his/her company and administer their access to various products in NetcoOnline. 

We will send copies of the PA to likely customers of NetCoOnline before we launch the site. The document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch. Customers will specify their Initial Password in the PA and must change it in the first log-in session. Upon receipt of signed PA, Netco will under normal circumstances enable the Master User Passwords within 24 hours for pre-approved customers. For counterparties with whom we are not familiar, more time is needed to run credit, legal, contracts, regulatory and tax check.


Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)

The ETA binds counterparties to completed transactions through NetcoOnline. When the counterparty accesses NetcoOnline for the first time, he/she will be prompted to read and accept the ETA in order to proceed. The ETA states that all trades done via NetcoOnline will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) posted online for a particular product, unless there is a Master or any other Agreement between Netco and the counterparty in place.


General Terms and Conditions (GTC)

To be sent when the Buyer is known.
When a customer offers to transact in a Product type for the first time, he/she will be presented with the relevant GTC. The GTC's are similar to a streamlined Master Agreement, in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity. GTC's identify termination rights, provisions for security (as appropriate), operational conventions (nominations, etc.), payment periods, tax treatments, force majeure, penalties for non-performance, etc. 

Customers must accept the terms of the relevant GTC online in order to proceed with a transaction, unless the company has a Master Agreement in place with Netco. Only one acceptance of GTC per Product Type per company is required. If there is a valid Master Agreement, then the system will not display the GTC, and the Master Agreement will apply.

I have reviewed the following documents from CSFBI:

(1) Cancellation letter for five (5) swaps (which were never confirmed)
(2) Equity Swap on 400,000 shares ENE
(3)  Two (2) Equity Forwards on 1,025,000 shares and 1,672,000 shares ENE, respectively

The forwards contain $40 price triggers which will be adjusted through either an amendment or put.  This will be documented after the swap and forwards are signed.

Please review the trade details for the swap and forwards, including share caps, floating amounts payable by ENE, spreads, etc.  You have an email version of the CSFBI documents.

The documents are in the format agreed to with CSFBI on October 2.

Let me know if you have any questions.  <NAME/>

<NAME/>,

Please, take a look at the link to the website
describing the Neptune project (a merchant transmission
DC line from Canada and Maine to  NE). The link is embedded in one of the messages below.

The Neptune Regional Electrical Transmission System will connect rapidly growing, electric-load centers in New York City, downtown Boston, and the Connecticut and New Jersey shores with clean and efficient electric generating facilities in Eastern Canada and Maine.

Employing state of the art, environmentally proven sub-sea cable technology, the Neptune System will overcome constraints to the existing land-based electric transmission grid which hinder the efficient use of energy resources along the Mid and North Atlantic seaboard. 


Any interest?

Do we lose the benefit of the special treatment under the bankruptcy code when we enter into cross-product (i.e. physical and financial products) netting and joint credit support arrangements.  If we agree with a counterparty to net all of our trading exposures under multiple agreements (swap agreements and gas, power, steel, coal, etc. trading agreements) to determine how much credit support should be posted and then only ask for a single LC that supports the whole shebang, do we lose this protection since arguably we are no longer just "under a swap agreement?"

California Retailers Association Supports PG&E Reorganization Plan
SACRAMENTO, Calif., Oct. 1 /PRNewswire/ -- California Retailers Association today released the following statement on Pacific Gas and Electric Company's proposal to emerge from bankruptcy: 
"The California Retailers Association supports this plan because of the many benefits it offers to California, its consumers, and its businesses." 
"We are pleased that this proposal would allow PG&E to pay the tens of thousands of small businesses who are owed money -- in full, with interest. These firms, through no fault of their own, have been hurt by this energy crisis, and should be made whole -- and will be, under this proposal." 
"We are particularly pleased that PG&E's plan does not include any kind of rate increase. With our economy hanging in the balance, the last thing California consumers or small businesses need is higher utility rates. The plan also will provide consumers with power pricing stability -- by locking in long-term prices for power at a relatively low price. This will benefit all customers by establishing fair prices that won't spike over time." 
"Finally, it is critically important to note that the plan is designed to return PG&E to financial viability so that the State of California can get out of the power procurement business, which has been taking funds away from other economic and social programs. The plan also does not require any legislative action or any financial bailout, so the State's attention and funds may once again be focused on their appropriate objectives." 
The California Retailers Association is a trade association representing major California department and specialty stores, mass merchandisers, grocery, chain drug and convenience stores. Our members have more than 9,000 stores in California and account for more than $100 billion in sales annually.

<NAME/> and <NAME/>:

I spoke with Roeline <NAME/> at Torch just a few minutes ago.  She is having a medical procedure today and probably won't be back in the office until Monday.  She answered my question, so I will finalize drafts of the assignments and give them to one of the lawyers for review.  The lawyer may want verification from Torch as to the appropriate entity that is the counterparty to the transactions being assigned (specifically the Dynegy trades), which evidence of authority Roeline will have to send when she returns to the office on Monday.  Roeline stated that she has not received the additional documentation from UOM so she is not aware of any urgency in finalizing these assignments until all documentation has been delivered to us to finalize documents.  We will want to see the additional documentation from UOM before we send the drafts out for review.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

A couple of thoughts on the SoCalGas Complaint

1.  Perhaps you will want to emphasize this as being a computer system programming mistake -- not a billing mistake.  The point would be to distinquish that its not like someone sat down to bill SoCalGas, read the Global Settlement and agreed with SoCalGas' interpretation of how to bill this.  The point would be to show that we made a mistake in putting the computer programming in-place to handle this.  

2. I don't think the GISB 6-mo limitation went into effect until 4/97 -- so arguably it doesn't address this issue.  Nevertheless, I agree with the mistake language.  The GISB transcript excerpts that I clipped for Dari & <NAME/> Sebesta for the IES dispute would be germaine (i.e. GISB didn't intend to bar mistakes ).

3. There is a FERC case that you might want to also cite for the concept of the equity of correcting past mistakes.  Transco discovered an error in their fuel calculation that was many years old.  FERC let them re-bill customers for something like $13 million dollars of undercharges.  I think this is a 2000 case.

California's $12.5 Bln Bond Sale May Be Salvaged, Official Says
Sacramento, California, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- California's $12.5 billion bond sale to cover energy costs may win approval if Governor Gray <NAME/> agrees to seek revisions of existing power contracts, a state regulatory official said. 
The bond sale stalled last week when the California Public Utilities Commission voted 4-1 against a plan to repay the state's power costs using utility rates. The commissioners favor another approach, opposed by <NAME/>, that would give them more authority over the state's $43 billion of power contracts. 
Some commissioners ``would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governor's part to renegotiate those contracts,'' said <NAME/> Brown, who was appointed to the PUC by <NAME/>. ``We're not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall. There's got to be some give here.'' 
Moody's Investors Service on Friday said California's $31.6 billion of debt may be downgraded for the second time this year, in part because of the delayed bond sale. California's budget deficit in fiscal 2003 may reach $9.3 billion if energy costs aren't repaid, state Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides said. 
The state has spent $10.4 billion since January buying electricity on behalf of PG&E Corp. and <NAME/> International utilities, which are insolvent. 
<NAME/> `Willing to Discuss' 
``It takes two to tango and we are certainly willing to discuss the contracts,'' said <NAME/> Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. 
<NAME/> will consider Brown's offer, ``especially in context'' of any refunds from generators that may be ordered, Maviglio said. State officials claim power generators have charged too much, and are asking federal regulators to order refunds. 
Power generators are ``willing to discuss it, but I wouldn't want anybody to have any false promise or hope that any enormous change will come from this,'' said <NAME/> Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing power sellers. Any companies willing to talk ``might want something else in return, and who knows what that might be.'' 
The planned bond sale, the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history, would repay the state's general fund for a $6.1 billion power loan and cover other power costs. The sale has been delayed by the disagreements among state leaders. 
`A Blank Check' 
Under state law, the PUC is required to provide enough revenue from consumer rates to meet the bond payments and cover power contracts. The Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying the power, has sole authority to determine its revenue needs. 
PUC President <NAME/> Lynch and others said an irrevocable financing order would make it difficult for the state to renegotiate power contracts. They also said the DWR has been given too much authority. In the past, the PUC has set utility rates. 
``It gives a blank check to the DWR for anything that they want to do going forward,'' said California Senate President Pro Tempore <NAME/> <NAME/>. 
The commissioners favor a plan to back the bonds with a surcharge on utility customers' bills. The proposal would let the PUC review the water department's revenue requirements and require a public hearing on the allocation of costs among the utilities. <NAME/> opposes that plan. 
``It's dead on arrival. It's still going to be vetoed,'' said Maviglio. The governor has until Sunday to sign or veto all the bills sent to him during the last session. 
The new plan would expose the state to breach-of-contract claims, the governor's office said in a statement last week. The state agreed with power generators to pay energy contracts before repaying the bonds. Making a change now ``would eliminate the security on which the power sellers relied'' the governor's office said in the statement. 
Critics of the long-term power contracts say the state's economy will be hurt by above-market costs for years to come. 
No matter which approach the state takes, ``the government ought to try to renegotiate the contracts anyway,'' <NAME/> said. ``And some of the generators have said they're willing to do it.''

I managed all back office issues of an asset management deal with <NAME/> Union Gas Company.  It was a two year deal in which <NAME/> was assigned all of the utilities' assets (supply contracts, transportation contracts, and storage contracts) and then became responsible for providing 100% of the gas requirements of BUG.  I was involved in the negotiations to sign the deal, mostly working with the supply group of BUG doing due diligence on their contracts.  I created a complex invoice model and worked with our trading group, our logistics group, our risk management group, and gas accounting group.  In addition, I made monthly trips to New York to manage the customer and take care of any issues.  It was a $24MM/Year deal.  I was the point person on this deal and worked on it for a year and a half before handing it off to someone else when I moved to risk.

I was involved in another asset management deal with Peoples Gas Company in Chicago.  I also did due diligence work and was involved in negotiations on the deal.  I also created invoice models.  I did not do the day to day work because I was on my way to risk management.  We started a joint venture with Peoples in Chicago.  I set up the risk management department and managed all mid and back office issues of the joint venture.  I managed two book administrators who worked in the Chicago office and made monthly visits to address any issues.  This office made $12MM in its first year and we had no issues from a risk management or accounting perspective.

I took over managing the West desk in risk when there was a $10MM flash to actual variance in the region.  Flash to actual is the difference between the reported P&L and the GL.  Within 3 months I had identified the variances and cleared them.  On a going forward basis I kept the variance at zero.  I identified problems in scheduling that were causing these variances and took proactive steps to fix the problem.  After managing the desk for 6 months, I was able to have everyone cross trained on other books.  This resulted in me being able to reduce the staff by one, saving the company approx $100K/Year.

<NAME/> Gray has informed me that you have been inquiring about modifying the Texas EOL physical products to ENA as the counterparty for June.  The products you have to be concerned about are Waha and Exxon <NAME/> Tailgate.  The other physical products are HPL related and will no longer be used.  There is a slight possibility that the Agua <NAME/> product may continue but I will contact you if it needs to be changed to ENA.  Our need for these ENA products will be approximately May 16th, when we want to roll out our June products.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Here is a brief summary of the latest DA proposal floating around the Senate.  The provisions could--and likely will--change.  The leader of the Senate (<NAME/>) is still expressing opposition to DA, so its fate remains unclear.  

No suspension of DA.
All customers must pay <NAME/> undercollection, whether they've been DA or not.
Customers going DA must first clear any payables to DWR for power previously consumed but not full paid for.
Customers going DA must pay for DWR's stranded power costs caused by the customer leaving, UNLESS DWR has a net short position, in which case there would be no stranded costs and therefore no fees.
The bill allows customers to file a complaint with the PUC regarding DWR's claims of stranded costs.
Customers who choose green DA power (defined as 80% renewable) will be exempt from stranded cost fees so long as green DA load does not exceed DWR's net short position.

In an October 3 update meeting with <NAME/> Buy and <NAME/> Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to <NAME/> and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  

In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   

Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at <NAME/> than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -<NAME/>

Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter
 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour, the agency said Wednesday. 

The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray <NAME/>, the department said. 

In a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said. 

Such sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said. 

The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total. 

According to the DWR, power secured under <NAME/>' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market. 

The state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years. 

<NAME/> has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices. 

The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said. 

The DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, <NAME/> International (EIX) unit Southern California <NAME/> and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San <NAME/> Gas & Electric.

<NAME/>,

We had an interview with Bobby and we were not impressed at all.

He started with a statement about his option pricing experience and when we asked 
a question about a basic concept in this area (the definition of volatility) he could not
define it. An answer to any question was that he did work in a different  area.
When we followed up with a question from this area (like quantum physics), he would
complain that the question is too detailed.


He comes across like a classical consultant (many buzzwords, little substance).

Hi <NAME/>,

Rice asked me to teach another course on energy derivatives and I plan to use the

and probably order a few more copies.

I am in London right now and will stay here for a few more days. Swamped
with work as usual. I was on the road for the last 2 weeks.

The tropical storm unleashed the fury on my neighborhood (20 inches in  one night)

THIRD EXTRAORDINARY SESSION CALLED 
Governor <NAME/> has called a special session on Tuesday, October 9 to consider and act upon legislation affecting the operation, maintenance, finances, and financial viability of investor-owned utilities that provide electricity or natural gas to California residents and businesses, including their procurement portfolios and practices, and service by alternate energy providers in their service territory. 
Extraordinary (Special) Session Rules and Procedures
Call of Special Session: 
Only the Governor has the authority to convene a special session of the Legislature. In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon. 
Election of Special Session Officers, Committees and <NAME/> Referrals: 
The election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees. 
Identification of Special Session Bills and Publications: 
Separate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper. 
Introduction of Special Session Bills: 
There is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session. 
Special Session <NAME/> Procedures and Calendars: 
There is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the "30-day in print" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session. 
Effective Date of Special Session Legislation: 
Simple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature. 
End of Special Session: 
Only the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session. The concurrent resolution takes effect upon passage by both houses of the Legislature, and is not subject to a Governor's signature or veto.

It appears that <NAME/> has officially called the Legislature back to try to address the <NAME/> issue.  Appears they'll reconvene beginning next Tuesday.  We'll report back when we get additional information.  There are some rumors going around that they might meet and simply appoint a "task force" comprised of legislators to continue working on the issue.  <NAME/> is reported to have said that he's telling senators who are on vacation that "this isn't worth cancelling a vacation over."

<NAME/>,

During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues 
related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.

Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system:
we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds
of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor 
and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the problem by mapping
them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.

We have agreed on the following:

1. <NAME/> will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can increase the number
of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will investigate the impact of a larger
number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.

2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity should be
modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense to monitor
the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less transparent aggregates.

3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be systematically
monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions.
This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the responsibility is
dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody
is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task;
cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.

I would recommend the following assumptions for capacity resubscription from now through Q3 2006:

The historical average rates should be assumed for the resubscription of East and <NAME/> to Blanco capacity rolling-off during this time period.  The forward curves that have been discussed represent the value of capacity to California, not East to East or <NAME/> to Blanco capacity.  I don't think that max rates for the capacity represented in these groups is appropriate.

The max rate at $.1020 is appropriate for the San <NAME/> group.

The appropriate max rate for the West group is $.2868.

The volume of <NAME/> to Blanco capacity available for resubscription should be reduced.  Today, we have contracts from <NAME/> to the Blanco Hub that then continue on Transwestern on another contract.  (These contracts existed before Transwestern owned this line and were assigned to Transwestern when we purchased the facilities from NWPL.)  Because of this "artificial break" in the contracts, Transwestern is collecting the San <NAME/> lateral rate once on a contract from <NAME/> to Blanco and then again on another contract from Blanco to Thoreau (or to the CA border).  In the future, when this capacity is resubscribed, the contracts will most likely not be split at the Blanco Hub and Transwestern will only extract the San <NAME/> lateral rate once from <NAME/> to Thoreau (or to the CA border).  Jan and I will look at the <NAME/> capacity that has historically continued on Transwestern south of the Blanco Hub (vs. delivering to El Paso at Blanco).  We will come up with a % to be applied to the <NAME/> to Blanco capacity that should be resubscribed at a zero rate (or the capacity to be resubscribed can be reduced - whichever is easier to put in the model).

Just wanted to let you guys in on a few things we have talked with Gossett about.  Today we officially begin the process for the New Company.  That being said, we now have to tighten the ship a bit.  From now on, please refrain from playing games and surfing the internet all day.  If you are bored and don't have anything to do, please look for things to do that are work related.  This is a good time to improve your skills and learn about things you are not absolutely proficient in.  Read some options books, study macros in the P&L's, etc.  The key phrase here is work to improve your skills so that we can shake off some of the rust we have developed in the last month.  All of this is coming from Goss and it is serious, to be a part of the new company you have to show that you are willing to contribute and are the best of the best.  

I know this sounds harsh, but we have all had a nice vacation and I am sure most of you are like me and looking forward to not having such a boring job.  It looks as though bidders will be in this week, so we will have some reports and demonstrations to give.

Good Morning <NAME/>,

I hope you had a nice weekend.  I have been working on the Interconnect Agreement for the Big Sandy Project and I would like to schedule some time for a telephone conference with you as I have a few "blanks" in the Interconnect Agreement that I would like to discuss with you so that our draft is as complete as it can be.  Would you have some time on Tuesday AM or Wednesday AM?  I would also be available on Thursday 2:00-3:00pm.  I'm thinking we need about a half an hour.   

Also, I can update you on the remaining capacity on our Red  <NAME/> Expansion which could be used to serve the plant.

Thanks, 
<NAME/>.

Thanks Vela.  My office address is fine.

Just so you know ahead of time what some of my questions will be:

1.  I'm a little concerned about the safety of in-mast furling systems generally.  What happens if it jams in a blow?
2.  Are the heads both electric?  <NAME/> they operate manually if you lose power?
3.  The boat seems remarkably well equipped.  What sorts of additional items are usual to purchase before she's ready to cruise?
4.  How do U.S. owners deal with the voltage issues and electrical repairs and replacements?
5.  Finally, and I suppose of least importance, I'm not thrilled with the teak-look deck or the blue cabin sole.  Any hope of a manufacturing change?

Thanks again and I'm looking forward to seeing you in Ft. Lauderdale!

A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, <NAME/> Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

Rudwell,  Attached is a redline of the guaranty with my comments.  Specifically they are:

	1.  I am OK with including reasonable attorney fees, but they must be included in the $2.5 million dollar cap.  
	2.  The use of subtantially in Paragraph 2 seems redundant.  The notice requires reasonable detail.  To add subtantial compliance on top of that is redundant.
	
I am OK with the other changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

<NAME/>,

The spreadsheet below ("Valuation Summary..") calculates the value <NAME/> would realize if we turned back the capacity or released it at full tolls.  As of 9/17 mids, the 200,000/d leg would generate $16,918,907 if turned back.  There is still a substantial amount of value above variable costs on the books.  For 03-06, variable costs are around $0.15 but the mid-market spread is $0.45.  The PV volume for that term is 22,000 contracts.

Once again, it appears we have changed a price desk deal without letting them know.  I hope everyone understands how bad this makes our entire team look.  This issue continues to be brought up in the staff meeting and we are always the cause of it.  This is the second time in less than a week and we have gone over this several times.  Next time this happens, someone is liable to get an exit early pass from the floor for good.  To keep this from happening we will now practice the following Rule:
Anytime a price desk deal that involves the central desk needs to be changed, the person that runs the central book will not leave the floor until <NAME/> or Joey tells you that there book is ok.  If that happens to be midnight, sorry.  That is the rule and there will be absolutely no exceptions.  Sorry I have to be a jerk, but it is obvious that being nice about it has not worked.

27th - <NAME/> family - first time they have seen <NAME/>
30th - at the embassy all day for green card

So how about afternoon of 29th?

<text file="LargeTest//a410.xml">
  <body>

<NAME/>:
A little background (recaps briefly what we discussed on the phone on Monday):
A few weeks ago, we (government affairs) approached <NAME/> Fielder of <NAME/> to see if there was any chance that <NAME/> might be willing to reach a deal on our Negative CTC/PX credit claim.
After discussions with RAC, we offered to take 90 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through March 1. (There's general agreement with <NAME/> on what the number is up to January 17, which would only leave 1.17--3.1 in dispute.  But recall there's still the FERC refund issue which complicates the issue.) 
We asked for 10% down immediately and a binding agreement that <NAME/> would pay us by a date certain sometime in the next quarter.  
In exchange, we said we'd drop our law suits at the PUC. In one suit, we're asking the PUC to have <NAME/> pay us. In the other, we've stopped paying <NAME/> for transportation costs until the PUC gets <NAME/> to pay us.  We're depositing what we owe <NAME/> in an escrow account pending resolution.
We also agreed to work with <NAME/> to get the PUC to end the whole residual CTC/PX credit framework retroactive to March 1, 2001.  (That would reduce <NAME/>'s exposure to negative CTC and our exposure to positive CTC.)
For his part, Fielder was looking (in addition) for 1) an agreement on our part to forebear, and 2) an agreement that everyone, including DA customers, should pay what they rightly owe for a) <NAME/>'s undercollection, b) the bonds, and c) DWR's stranded contract costs.
We never resumed the talks in earnest because soon after our talk, <NAME/> struck its bailout deal with the PUC. 

With respect to what else we could offer them:
From a commercial standpoint, I'm sure you're scouring that front, and I may not have much to add.  But given the credit risk associated with the utility and <NAME/>'s other subs, devising a commercial option to help settle the negative CTC claim seems like a challenge.
One possible avenue might be the $250 MM in hedging activity the PUC agreed to in its bailout settlement with <NAME/>.  <NAME/> is authorized to hedge its generation and QF fuel costs for up to $250 MM under the settlement. (But this would expose us to PUC regulatory risk, in addition to <NAME/>'s credit risk.)
Another commercial angle might be Mission Energy, but again, not sure how much better Mission fares from a credit perspective.
One idea that we've bounced around that might appeal to <NAME/>--but may or may not be appealing to us--us is to agree to take a note from <NAME/>.  That is, in return for 100 cents on the dollar, we'd agree to take, for example, a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon.  
This should appeal to <NAME/> since 1) it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in, 2) it might provide a useful template that <NAME/> could use with other creditors, and 3) it lessens the overall financing <NAME/> needs to arrange (bridge loan, etc.) in the near-term to pay its creditors.
The "note" angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with Fielder.

<NAME/> this helps.

Best,
<NAME/>

Police follow naked man to pot crop 
  <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/spacer.gif>
  <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/spacer.gif>
By <NAME/> Kelly 
Herald Writer 


CAMANO ISLAND -- A naked man found wandering around Stanwood Cinemas led police to his indoor marijuana garden after deputies asked the man what he did for a living, police said Wednesday. 

Deputies from the Island County Sheriff's Office said they removed more than 80 marijuana plants -- including 50 or so mature plants -- from a shed behind the 30-year-old man's home on Maple Tree <NAME/>, a dead-end road on the south end of the island. 

The strange saga began Saturday night when moviegoers and diners in restaurants near the theater's courtyard reported seeing a naked man walking around the complex in full view of families dining out. 

When an officer approached the man and asked why he was walking around naked, the man reportedly said that he felt like it so he just did it. An officer writing the man a ticket for indecent exposure then asked the man what he did for a living, and he allegedly said he grew marijuana. 

According to a police report, the man then asked for the officer's help in harvesting the crop. The officer said he was too lazy to help but offered to go look at the man's operation, and the naked man agreed. 

In the outbuilding behind the man's mobile home, police found what they described as a "sophisticated hydroponic grow operation." 

Deputies allegedly found numerous grow lights on timers, fans and a complicated watering system with a line running to each of the plants. 

Police said the man seemed proud of his operation, telling them that the system used no dirt, just lava rock, and he picked a large bud from a plant and handed it to an officer. 

In a written statement to police, the man allegedly said: "I grow marijuana for fun and profit, to support myself and my family, to help bring us a better life." He also said he was growing marijuana for his father, who had a disease, and for other "medically ill people." 

The man's wife told police she had never been inside her husband's shed, but that was where her husband did his artwork and practiced with his yo-yo. 

Deputies said they asked the man what he expected them to do after he showed them his garden, and the man said he didn't expect them to do anything. 

Police, however, confiscated the plants and growing equipment. The man was cooperative, they said, even helping to load the equipment into police vehicles. 

The man may be charged with manufacture of a controlled substance, but he is not named because charges have not been filed.

Batten down the hatch's and get ready for young <NAME/>'s first experience with Tropical Storms ! Here comes <NAME/> !

On another note we went live with TQ yesterday. Unbelievable huh...We did one trade with Tuscon Elec. the first day and today we did three, all with PG&E, who happen to own 40% of TQ. Pretty lame.

On a good note, we hit a record today with BrokerClient, 53 trades. 46 power and 7 gas, which is nicely diversifying.

Other interesting note: We launched Reuters on Monday and the NYMEX wants to put it up on one of their huge wallboards. They would buy a block of desktops to cover it. Bad news is that, <NAME/> <NAME/>, my new boss in approx 25 days, with some justification thinks this is a bad idea. He will lose the ability to arb the floor against the OTC. My view is that this will go away anyway as eNymex and ICEX do the same thing. What are your thoughts ?

Thane --

You are probably already aware but if not, <NAME/> holds an interest in Project Cornhusker (a QF in Cleburne).  There are some issues that may develop with the plant related to its ability or inability to meet specific ERCOT guidelines.  Generation Investments is managing this asset and relations with Brazos Co-op. Their primary concern is that Mirant is Brazos Co-op's QSE and may be interested in playing games with the plant through modification of ERCOT rules. 

Please coordinate with <NAME/> and decide who will call either <NAME/> Hill or <NAME/> <NAME/>.

The project coordinators believe they can reach a solution with Accenture in which <NAME/> pays no additional fees but the project is completed in a slightly scaled back form.  This allows Accenture to have a completed project and no more cash goes out the door.

I agree with you that this serves as a good case study  - underscores indeed that we need to start some of the projects under Project Greenlight instead of continuing to document problems.

<NAME/>.   Things are pretty hectic right now.  There is a lot of uncertainty about the future.  Dynegy acquired <NAME/> (it is so odd to say that) for its trading business and EES so I think my position is safe for the time being.  Up until the acquisition was formalized it was pretty depressing at work, but things have started to pick up again.  I am glad to hear that classes are going well - keep the seat next to you warm because I may be forced up there pretty soon.  Of course, now that <NAME/>'s name has been dragged through the mud it will probably be a little more difficult to go to a good B-school.  Good luck on finals and keep in touch.

My thoughts --

1.	Great job.
2.	I would change the message in the conclusion (and elsewhere) that the work should be done at the same time -- The Commission should act quickly to establish the scope and configurations of RTOs, WHILE ALSO WORKING and then begin the process of creating a standardized pro forma transmission tariff and market design to be implemented by these RTOs.  
3.	Thanks for getting in "Network Plus" - it's the little things that matter.
4.	Maybe strengthen that just standardizing is not enough - real integration across seams is imperative. NY and PJM have same tariff same model but haven't worked well for a long time.

Thanks.

<NAME/>,

Attached is the (long-awaited) spec for the 200K gallons of low-sulphur #2 Fuel Oil to partially refill the tank at the Ft. <NAME/> facility in Florida.
As the attached note describes, the final spec is a result of the combined spec requirements by the environmental permit, MHI (Mitsubishi), and Engineering.

We currently believe that some of these specs may be more stringent than what is commercially available.  In the event that some of these specs are too stringent, we would like you to: 1) identify which specs are not reasonably attainable, and 2) suggest what value of these specs are attainable.   Your feedback will be shared with the appropriate parties and, assuming there are spec change recommendations, these parties will determine how best to proceed.  

Please note that the first attached note requests than any bids we get contain info on density, heating value, and trace contaminants.  Additionally, the second attached note references getting multiple bids for different specs.  I suggest that, for now, we resolve the spec issue internally as described above and then we obtain quotes.   If you have any other suggestions on how best to proceed, your input is welcome.

Your assistance in this matter is, and has been, greatly appreciated.

<NAME/>:  I left you a voice mail earlier.  I'm concerned about the definition of "Specified Transaction".  As drafted, I read this as cross defaulting to all other derivative trades between ENA and BSIL, as well as ENE and BSIL.

yah, i'm looking forward to yoga.  i didn't do anything over break and was really looking forward to starting up my practice again and went several times as soon as i got back, but then i got sick, so ... i may try to take a nap this afternoon before yoga.  i'm very bad with directions.  i have the address at home and can call you with it, but basically, i go east on 12th Ave, turn right on (i think) 8th Street and then turn left on (i think) 24th Ave (there's an asian restaurant at this corner) and then it's up on the right side.  there's a big block of warehouse buildings.  it's a little complicated to find from here actually, maybe you should pick me up and we can go together?  

i don't really shop for "yoga clothes" partly out of some sort of philosophical resistance and also because the women's stuff is so much cooler than men's stuff that i don't want to bother.  

dude, that 6:00am yoga story is brutal!  YIM is going downhill - i don't think rockne can hold onto his good instrucors.  i hope core yoga stays solvent!

Attached is the spreadsheet version of the template we discussed this morning.   I have added the additional columns everyone requested.   I would now like the business unit leads to fill in the blanks such that we have an initial Power Implementation Plan that can be delivered to <NAME/> on Friday.
 
With respect to East Power (I am out Thursday and Friday), I am delegating to all of my desk heads the responsibility the following:
1) Have all of the forms attached spreadsheet forms complete
2) A product offering sheet is added to the template.

<NAME/> & Dana - Please take the lead on creating the product offering list (physical and financial).  My recommendation is we put products out through 03 for all regions (financial and physical).   Obviously, the physical products will be contingent on receiving a power marketing license.

Cory and <NAME/> Baughman - Please take a crack at identifying all of the transmission service agreements we need for the East (<NAME/> has started a list already).

Please call me on my cell (713-856-3923) with any questions.

<NAME/>,
      As of today, El Paso's offer stands at $550m., and our value (<NAME/>'s and Corps.) stands at $800m.  <NAME/> has been told by El Paso that the deal (if any) is on hold.  Due to the value gap, we're skeptical that we'd reach terms that we could submit to a Trustee.  As for the PSA, <NAME/> has only prepared an outline of the necessary terms and has been told to slow play this one due to the value gap and El Paso's signal that this is on hold for the time being.
      If you'd like us to turn up the fire on this, we can.  I am a bit unclear (especially based on McMahon's comments on Sunday as to what is core, how we might restructure, and that asset sales were not on the front burner) as to what our key priorities are besides running the going concerns and preservation of value.

I think we should talk with them if the have the cash.  However, I get very nervous when anyone would commit $100 to $200 million with limited due diligence.  Also, I would not want to announce anything until the deal closes.  Preannouncing a deal of this size isn't goi8ng to stabilize anything.  $1 to $2 BILLION might get a different answer.  As to your involvement, you made the right call.

From our work weekend before last, our third scenario (staying in the business, but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels), our estimated savings for Operations and IT Development were:

	Annualized Savings (in millions)  & Headcount Reductions (<NAME/> Employees)

Direct Costs			Bonus		Subtotal 			Net 		Cap		Total 
Ops		IT		Accural		Savings		Severance	Savings		Ex		Savings

5.4		12.8		1.5		19.7		3.8		15.9		11.8		27.7	Dollar Savings


65		71		-		136									FTE Reduction



This work was not done at the level of identifying individuals, but rather positions.  identify indiOur work today will be to further refine this estimate and to individuals' names.  We have already identified our lower performers across Operations and IT as well.  We had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting EIM and EGM who could potentially support EA and EES in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units.  

The above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from <NAME/> Rub, which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings).  The estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that may result from cost reductions that <NAME/> Piper is having with <NAME/> Richter.  

Your desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible.  We will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you.

In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in conversations around CommodityLogic. 

Staffing Contributions
	CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  <NAME/> Slagle, Manager
	CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  <NAME/> <NAME/>, Manager
	CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  <NAME/> Solmonson, Senior Director
	CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  <NAME/> Sumrow, Specialist

	User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power Confirmation Team and 		Financial Settlements 

Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic

	NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations)
	ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations) 


Two of the Project Managers on the team, <NAME/> Slagle and <NAME/> <NAME/>, were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to <NAME/> Price.  Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing both <NAME/> and <NAME/> well, I viewed them as valuable members of the operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most appropriately .  <NAME/> Price and I worked together to sell <NAME/> and <NAME/> on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very quickly.  

One of the key team members working under <NAME/> Slagle on NomLogic was a scheduler on our gas team (<NAME/>).  <NAME/> Hall, our opeartions controller over natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since <NAME/> and <NAME/> have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and <NAME/> Superty, who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  <NAME/> looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently renamed it NomLogic.  <NAME/> had been a member of the Contract Exchange project team, and we transfered her along with the project to CommodityLogic.  

Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is input from my group that has created the modules by defining user requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.   

In the fall, I assigned <NAME/> Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.  I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed <NAME/>'s participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, <NAME/> was the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to CommodityLogic, <NAME/> developed a plan for ContactLogic that <NAME/> feels is excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  

Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - <NAME/> Reeves, who played a significant role in building <NAME/>'s power business from day one, and <NAME/> Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and back office operations.   <NAME/> <NAME/> and <NAME/> Slagle were their replacements on CommodityLogic.

I believe that your skillset would be a positive addition to the West Gas origination group. We can provide for you a new learning experience by becoming a key component of the team. You will be asked to provide real time modeling, DCF, research on wellhead to burner tip strategies. You will learn a tremendous amount about the Natural gas business with exposure stemming from the wellhead to the burner tip. Some areas include, commodity price risk structures, risk management initiatives, financial and physical markets, structured products and transportation related initiatives.  

Please use this note as a formal offer of employment. I would like you to start as soon as you can.. ( next 2 weeks) and will leave this for you to think about until the end of day on Monday.

Just so you know, I am nearer the bottom of the issue.  

A user of ibuyit can select whether they want new equipment or old equipment.  So I surveyed our assistants - obviously more than ours up here, to see if any of them knew that you could order OLD equipment instead of NEW.  None of them did, including TJ Black who has since I have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most IT equipment.

<NAME/>'s group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment.  <NAME/> Black's equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels.  So the buying is done by EA and someone else is benefitting.

As there is no way around ibuyit, I think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment.

As no-one replied to my previous email - I live in hope.

<NAME/> Call 3rd Special Session to Keep <NAME/> from Bankruptcy

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray <NAME/> made the following comments after legislation designed

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the

Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.

"It is critical to keep <NAME/> solvent so that we do not lose 3,000
Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers. We
worked hard to bring this energy, which was crucial in avoiding blackouts,
back on-line earlier this summer.

"I will call a Third Extraordinary Session, which will begin in

California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility 
JENNIFER KERR, Associated Press Writer
Saturday, September 15, 2001 
?2001 Associated Press 

URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2001/09/15/national0541EDT0485.DTL>

(09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- 

The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California <NAME/> from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray <NAME/> called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility. 

As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds. 

But senators remained cool to <NAME/>' idea of bailing out Southern California <NAME/>. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday. 

"We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor," said President Pro Tem <NAME/> <NAME/>. "It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation." 

The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since <NAME/> first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for <NAME/>'s transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt. 

Without the deal, <NAME/> faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. <NAME/> says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts. 

The special session is meant to take another shot at saving <NAME/> from sliding into bankruptcy. 

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring <NAME/> to creditworthiness," <NAME/> in a statement after midnight Saturday. "Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done." 

The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school. 

The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing. 

It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders. 

While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds. 

<NAME/> joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks. 

The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks. 

The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal. 

"Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance," said <NAME/>.

According to <NAME/> Kolb, he has a meeting with the Kuo's today to give a final blessing to the release.  He doesn't foresee any issues.  If they are ok with the document, they want to sign and exchange checks in person.  I will be in San <NAME/> this weekend.  Saturday at 3 PM in Seguin would work well for me.  He is proposing that time to the Kuo's.  How does your schedule look?  It would be nice to finally put this behind us.

Any word on a closing date for <NAME/>?

<NAME/> got your voice mail last week.  Sorry about not getting to talk with you, but I am taking the month of December off so as not to give <NAME/> my vacation.  Im not going to give it away anymore.  I would have liked to talked to you.  Things are somewhat stressful around here.  Probably worse in <NAME/>.  <NAME/> is screening  e mails so everyone is a little tense. Lots of things are going on with <NAME/> trying to bail itself out of this mess.  As you may have heard, they severed about 4500 people so far, Joe Kolb and <NAME/> Stevens were among those.  Ive kept a low key on the daily news reports about what is going on, so I really dont know much.  This was a good time to take my vacation.  This whole thing doesnt seem to be bothering me, as I am relying on <NAME/>, my higher power and that has been my strength and comfort. Its a good feeling to know that whatever happens, my family and I will be just fine.

Hows Christmas in the desert? Were you able to find an acceptable substitute for a tree?  this was a good time for you to stretch your wings.

<NAME/>, I hope you and everyone in the Ayers household has a very merry <NAME/>mas.  I think of you much and hold you in my prayers.  When we stop and reflect upon all that man has done to warp the meaning of our Savior's birth, it becomes hard to focus on the real meaing.  I pray that you are a wonderful witness to a lost and twisted people  in Katar and remember the love of <NAME/> that was revealed to us in his cruxificion.  I am thankful for our Great High Priest who has opened up the doors of heaven for us and by His Spirit has given us the opportunity to peek through the veil and know the Holies of Holies.

Sta. 3 and 4, I am sending to you via regular mail, the new air permits for the Redrock Expansion.  I will be contacting you in the near future about coming out and going through the permits to assign responsibilities between you and me.  If you get some time, I would suggest that you look over each permit as there is additional recordkeeping and reporting above that which is on your existing permit.  the old permit will expire when the facility begins operation of the turbine.  For Station 4, if a turbine is not installed at your location, this new permit wont apply.  But in the event it happens, you have the permit.

Bottom line, you need to keep this permit at each location.

Hey Guys!  I just got back from traveling two weeks in <NAME/>, so I am now able to answer my emails.  A friend of mine here at <NAME/> has a brother that lives in <NAME/> and he got married to a Chinese national.  So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.  The sights were pretty amazing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc.  Definitely culture shock though.  I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.  I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.  I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.  The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.  

Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, <NAME/>!  I heard about it the first week in <NAME/>.  Wasn't much I could do from <NAME/>, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.  Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.  There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.  Doooh!!

Other than that everything is going fine.  Doing the old dating thing!  Boy is that a ton of laughs.  Women at this age are definitely interesting.  I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, "Where is this relationship headed?"  Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!  

Congratulations, <NAME/> on little <NAME/>.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you <NAME/>?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!

<NAME/>,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in <NAME/>.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  <NAME/>, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.

Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.

On Friday, the Assembly failed to get its version of the <NAME/> MOU out of the appropriations committee.
The bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full Assembly for passage.
Negotiations continue among Assembly Democrats about what the final bill should look like.
The Assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the Assembly on Tuesday.
In response to the California PUC proposed order, which would retroactively end Direct Access on July 1, the Assembly amended its bill on Friday to include its own "date certain" for the temporary suspension of Direct Access.
The Assembly bill would now suspend Direct Access beginning August 25.
We are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to either 1) the date the bill is signed or 2) September 1.
We will provide additional information on Tuesday about the bill's status and our progress in changing the suspension date.

<NAME/> & <NAME/> --

I am somewhat concerned that the implications of having to act as tax collector is creating a push to change the way REPs work with the T&D company.  In <NAME/>'s advocacy throughout my years, we have always asked the PUCs to make the marketer the "customer of record" - better limits the Utility control over the market.  Now it appears that this good decision of the PUCT has tax implications and means that we have to process the taxes.  I don't see that trying to support a change is a good thing from our long-run business.   Moreover, if we are paying Gross Receipts taxes and didn't include them into our customer costs than we made a mistake.  This is a cost of our business.  

Let's talk.

Here are my comments:

Section 9b-  It is my understanding that the Utility lines are currently under construction and should be finished by late February 2002.  Can we reference the work that is being performed by the contractor, JC Evans.  I want to avoid any ambiguity regarding the "Utility Lines".  Also can we make the same distinction in the Utility Construction Escrow Agreement in Section C.

 Section 10-  Please change to Purchaser can extend closing for 3 successive periods of 30 days each for $10,000 per extension, not applicable to purchase price and non-refundable.

Also, I would prefer to sign the first amendment and the utility escrow documents at the same time since they reference each other.

I only show that we should have triggered 1127631 for December and they did not trigger 1131418 at all.  They will need to provide documentation to us - i.e. signed confirms that show this was done.  Is the trigger price they are suggesting in our favor or not?  If it is in our favor, I am sure we will change it ASAP.  Please let me know.

Thanks for that laugh! I needed it.

Here's the deal:

A call swaption was sold to me by pollard for the intrinsic and extrinsic value of the desks on the floor times 3.50 per month.  I sold this put to myself and pocketed a next fixed premium of one million dollars. I took that six million dollars and used it to finance the new snickers plant that is going to be built in 10 years.  I divided the reesee's plant and the snickers plant, sold put-call parodies on the reesee's and put the snickers plant up for collateral on a 20 million dollar loan to finance potato chip options.

My net was 3.5 billion dollars, so I am the one buying <NAME/>.

My new Company is called  "<NAME/>-land".  I am working on the national anthem now.

Monday, June 11 has been set as the date for my operations PRC meeting.  At this meeting we will briefly review the results from numerous smaller PRC meetings that will have been held by my team during the week of June 4.  On June 11, we will give a cursory review to the results from the smaller PRC meetings from analysts through manager.  Our primary goal will be to make sure that the appropriate distribution has been met, and that we are aware of the individuals that are 1's and 5's.    The main focus of the meeting will be to cross calibrate directors, senior directors and VP's across the operations organization and the teams that support EA, EGM and EIM.  (We are still debating if and how we cross calibrate with the London operations team) 

You mentioned today that you might like to attend this meeting.  I wanted you to have the date so that you could put this on your calendar.

The longer the issue drags on, the more exposed DWR will be, the greater the likelihood of DWR contract negotiation, and the tougher it will be to drag the suspension date back to July 1.  In addition, hearings would (finally) force DWR to answer some questions---this time under oath, and possibly with the press present, which would be very beneficial--I'm talking to other folks to try to get <NAME/> make that happen.

Thanks for the note.  We are really trying very hard to keep the trading and marketing organisation in North American gas and power together with a view to selling it.  We have a lot of interest at the moment so I have my fingers crossed. Everyone is still here and to be honest I'm proud of the fact they are holding on still to see if we can compete the sale.

Here's a little fact - two years to the day of launch I turned EnronOnline off worldwide when it was in full swing, it was actually just when we had the downgrade announcement.  I think it will be back though.

I think I am still in shock that a rogue finance group and some bad investments brought down a trading shop.  That must be first.

More than 6,000 (more than 4,000 American citizens) innocent civilians have been killed in a brutal attack on our country and our way of life.  If that is not worth fighting for, then what in your opinion is?  I will admit, I am a conservative and therefore our opinions will usually be polarized on many issues.  I am glad that life in our country allows for dissent.  But I think that this right is worth the ulimate sacrifice.  I honestly believe that if we do not respond, and with calculated deadly force, that we ultimately lose.  And I am not talking about losing a war, but our freedom.

According to <NAME/>, the release is with the Kuo's attorney, <NAME/> Kolb.  I just spoke to <NAME/>.  The Kuo's have been away on vacation.  He is going to try and get things finalized this week.  It sounds like they want to sign and exchange money in person.  This Saturday afternoon in Seguin will probably be  the most convenient time.  I will let you know when I hear more from <NAME/> Kolb.

Well, today things suck, but overall everything is great.  I lost about $100,000 this morning because I'm an idiot, but it's not completely my fault.  Anyway, you should definitely take an earlier flight so we could go to dinner or something.  Too bad it's not at the end of week so you could stay over, even though if you wanted to, you could.  I could leave work pretty much anytime on wednesday, so just let me know.  If you don't have my work number, its 713-853-0472.  Thanks.

No problem.  To be honest, I was concerned--given how wide-ranging it was--that I might step in something unintentionally.  Please let me know if I do/did.

I received a call today to remind us of this from PGE transmission.  Apparently, they have been noting, as practice who's in compliance and who isn't, and I guess our stats aren't looking good.

Hey, what up?  i'm still in Portland, in the office right now.  Had a pretty cool time this weekend.  Checked out Hood <NAME/>, a little town on the Columbia <NAME/> Gorge and then headed up to Mt. Hood yesterday.  I think its about 11,000 ft high. There's a really old lodge half way up...it was almost snowing!  Actually, up near the summit you can ski year round....but i don't think many people do.  The little trip made me think about our ski plans, which we should definitely keep pursueing.  I apologize i'm a little out of touch up here in Portland, maybe I'll do some surfing when i get a chance.  So, this chick fun...i don't really know what it is, but i feel comfortable hanging out with her...I think maybe its just that she's pretty down to earth.  She ski's a lot and plays soccer every week, so i guess there some common interests there.  She's totally not into fancy expensive things...which is good because she's broke...want's to go back to school so she can teach.  Only other comment is that she's got a little hippie in her...but i guess you can't have everything...

Anyway, I took some pictures, so I'll send them to you sometime.  I have to run.  Thanks for the email.

I'm working from the office here while they have fun on the town.  Actually, they seem to be spending a lot of time at the hotel watching the news, and I can't say that I totally blame them -- it seems almost disloyal to go out and have fun.  They were going to a play this afternoon and got tickets for us to see Mama <NAME/> (the musical based on ABBA) for tomorrow night.  I was originally scheduled to fly back yesterday (Wednesday) and have been rebooked on a flight Sunday afternoon.  The hotel finally told me this morning that we can keep our rooms until then.  I hope the flights are running by then.

<NAME/> is being taken care of but I feel really bad having her be alone all this time.  <NAME/> Avant was stranded in <NAME/> for a day -- they had to take a taxi back to <NAME/> the next day -- and Jamie said they would go over that afternoon.

Please note that these are really rough based on the limited information available at this time.  I did not provide a lease agreement for Oakhill as you indicated Hanover would finance/lease the Electric Motor Drivers to ECS.  If Hanover is providing a straight lease, the lease for Bay Gas could be used.  If Hanover is providing a purchase option, the lease agreement would need to be modified for the purchase option.  My suggestion is to provide these forms to the customer with the caveat that as the commercial terms are fine tuned, these drafts will be modified.  But this gives them the basic idea.

<NAME/> Walters: <NAME/> bailout plan is oddest piece of legislation in recent memory



(Published Aug. 29, 2001)

Senate <NAME/> 78XX may be the most unusual legislation to hit the Capitol in decades, in terms of both its content and its convoluted political dynamics.

The measure is the latest incarnation of months-long efforts by Gov. Gray <NAME/> and some legislators to rescue Southern California <NAME/> from joining its larger cousin, Pacific Gas and Electric, in bankruptcy court. That is odd unto itself, since state legislation to openly provide billions of dollars in benefits to one private corporation may be unprecedented.

Literally dozens of versions of legislation to bail out <NAME/> have floated around the Capitol, ever since <NAME/> announced last spring that he had reached agreement with <NAME/> <NAME/>, chairman of <NAME/> International, the utility's parent corporation. The <NAME/> deal was announced just a few days after PG&E rejected <NAME/>' overtures and took itself into bankruptcy court. Both utilities ran up many billions of dollars in debts buying power in the last six months of 2000 because the state rejected their pleas to raise retail rates.

<NAME/>'s -- or perhaps <NAME/>'s -- fear of bankruptcy is another puzzling aspect of the issue, given the almost cheerful manner in which PG&E placed itself in receivership. <NAME/> has spent millions of dollars on lobbying, advertising and other forms of political persuasion, trying to nudge the Legislature into passing a rescue plan that lawmakers are clearly reluctant to do.

Is avoiding bankruptcy a matter of personal pride for <NAME/>? Or, as some suggest, does it stem from <NAME/>'s tardiness in erecting an impregnable financial fire wall between the utility's assets and those of the parent holding company, <NAME/> International? <NAME/> scrambled to build a fire wall after bankruptcy loomed, but financial analysts are uncertain that it's as strong as PG&E's.

The dynamics within the Capitol and among various interest groups are equally odd, following none of the patterns that usually explain why politicians do what they do. Legislators of both parties are all over the map on the <NAME/> issue, and factions that are ordinarily allied find themselves at odds. One example: Liberal consumer groups are strenuously opposing any bailout for the utility, while liberal environmentalists like the current scheme because it would bring thousands of acres of <NAME/>-owned <NAME/> watershed under state control.

Perhaps the most mysterious aspect of the <NAME/> situation is why <NAME/>, ordinarily the most cautious, commitment-averse of politicians, is making such a crusade of keeping the utility out of bankruptcy court. Why would <NAME/> put so much of his gubernatorial prestige behind such an iffy proposition that exposes him to leverage from lawmakers seeking other favors from the governor and, polls indicate, is not popular with voters?

<NAME/> Rosenfield, the consumer gadfly who has established a "war room" near the Capitol to fight the <NAME/> scheme, believes that <NAME/>' unusual efforts stem from a desire to run for president in 2004 and a fear that Wall Street would blackball him if <NAME/> follows PG&E into bankruptcy court.

Another possible explanation is <NAME/>' decades-long relationship with <NAME/>. The two served together in former Gov. Jerry Brown's administration (<NAME/> was Brown's Public Utilities Commission president) and both have strong ties to the Democratic political organization in West Los Angeles headed by Reps. <NAME/> Waxman and <NAME/> Berman, who, in effect, allowed <NAME/> to launch his career by winning a West Side state Assembly seat in 1982.

The most influential member of <NAME/>'s board of directors is <NAME/> <NAME/>, a Democratic elder statesman and former secretary of state. <NAME/> and <NAME/> flew to Sacramento late last year to plead with <NAME/> to take command of the energy crisis, allow utilities to raise rates and staunch the red ink. <NAME/> refused, and nearly a year later finds himself trying to keep <NAME/> out of bankruptcy court.

We may never know why <NAME/> is going to bat for <NAME/>, but we will know, very soon, whether he can pull it off or will wind up with egg on his face.

Great idea.  

My key points would be that (a) FERC needs to push ahead with its "right sized" RTOs and (b) focus on standardizing the tariff and market design [no more collaborative efforts].  Two simple, easy to understand thoughts.  

Also, I think that it's a mistake to use the term "large RTOs".  We don't want large RTOs.  We want RTOs that cover natural markets and benefit consumers.

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.

Same a mid year

I'm smarter than everyone else.

Just in Case

*  Managed a Trading group that is up 2 Billion (more if you included hits taken) - probably not due to me.
*  Left a lot of money in Canada - some is still there.
*  Led the PPA deal - which I will resign and buy personally if you want to turn it back.
*  Created the Gas Fundamentals Group which every business unit is copying.
* Came up with LTP which everybody hates but will fix our trader shortage in the future and every company is copying.
*  Trained many great young kids in Calgary that are now key players in <NAME/>.
*  Created structure and communication around our system strategy - brought traders, IT, and back office together to create a plan that everyone has bought into.  The future success is unclear but the exercise was very worthwhile.
*  Had very few VAR violations and helped improve our understanding and reporting of VAR.  Completed mended the relationship between gas trading and the risk group.
*  Should get most credit for the increase in power trades on EOL and the continuation of the increase in Gas.
*  Turned the East Power group into a focused trading group not a think tank that bets on July-Aug power price - Still nowhere near completion.
*  Put a halt on the hiring of unqualified people - Have spent many hours devising a plan to bring in qualified - experience people.  You will see this implemented in 2001.
*  Experimented with the "Pay PRC"  which I think was very successful.  I think this will start our organization to think a little differently and hopefully in a way that will benefit us.
*  Possibly the best accomplishment is "Killing the Dragon".

Transaction ID 610 Product ID 35729 did not book correctly.  It is a two leg deal.  The first leg is a GD index deal and the price component has the wrong book.  It has AB-PWR-ST-GD and should be FB-CENT2.  The second leg is a F4F deal and it put the wrong value in the price component and basis component.  Previous nights price settle should be in price and $.02 should be in basis.  The deal has $.02 in price and $.00 in basis.

<NAME/> --

Can you please draft a letter (similar to what <NAME/> Darmitzel sent to gas LDCs) to send to PECO Thursday to indicate that placing our physical load customers on bundled POLR service is not objectionable to EES?  

We have a bill due in PJM this Thursday that may not get paid.  If we don't pay PJM on Thursday, our brief analysis of the PA Supplier Tariff is that PECO can pull these customers back.  

The customers in PECO are GNO (e.g, Suiza), so not sure what the contract issues would be - maybe <NAME/> can help here.  My understanding is that the contracts should allow EES to serve using Utility power, so we should still have the right to determine to reject or not.

Please let me know if you can do this and if there are any issues.

Guys, with respect to the above, as you know, WGR was responsible for all compliance submittals during the time that we owned and they operated.  I know in the past, prior to their taking over ownership, I would remind them each year that a particular document was requried.  I figured that when they became owners, they didnt need me anymore.  <NAME/>, you are right, <NAME/> Moyer was the environmental contact for WGR and he was the one I would contact and apprise.  It just so happens that I have copies of previous annual submittals from WGR for the Gomez facility  when the facility was under our ownership, their responsibility.  I even have a copy of the Title V Permit.  When I was told that we no longer owned the faclity, I sent all information I had to WGR, but kept copies of the stuff I had, just in case.  I can send it one more time if you want me too.  Let me know.....

You'll love this.  ALCOA has sent us an amendment to the ISDA (that was signed 1/99) and wants to amend the "threshold amount" in Part 1 so that it corresponds to the current credit rating of the applicable party as indicated in Paragraph 13.  I think we are mixing apples and oranges!  Obviously they didn't understand the difference when they signed the ISDA in '99.  And it's the same lawyer sending the amendment who negotiated the master.

Sheridan,

I am aware of the duplicate check problem and I owe you phone call 
about this. I am still trying to mobilize internal support for the valuation 
study we discussed at San <NAME/>. <NAME/> Ruane whom you met, moved on
to a new job and his successor is a bit skeptical about the need for a study.
Internal <NAME/>  perception is that we understand the process of decision making
inside big  financial institutions (or lack of it), especially in the energy area,
regarding valuation of investment projects. Any study would just reveal what we
already understand about quite simplistic tools they use: DCF with a discount
rate being subject to negotiations within a very broad band of potential
values.

It will help if I get the agenda of the conference  soon to pass it on to <NAME/> Skilling. It would
also help if you could write a formal letter to him.

On another "food for thought" note.  <NAME/> and <NAME/>:  Here's the WSJ editorial by <NAME/> <NAME/>--long-time NPR dude, credentialed lib, and Quaker--on "just wars."  Sort of thought-provoking.

Commentary
Even Pacifists Must
Support This War

By <NAME/> <NAME/>, the host of National Public Radio's "Weekend Edition With <NAME/> <NAME/>."

Pacifists often commit the same mistake as generals: They prepare for the last war, not the next one. Many of the peace activists I have seen trying to rouse opposition to today's war against terrorism remind me of a Halloween parade. They put on old, familiar-looking protest masks -- against American imperialism, oppression and violence -- that bear no resemblance to the real demons haunting us now.

Pacifism has never been exactly popular. But when I became a Quaker as an adolescent in the late 1960s, pacifism seemed to offer a compelling alternative to the perpetuity of brute force. Mahatma Gandhi had overthrown an empire and <NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/> had overturned a racial tyranny with nonviolent marches, fasts, and boycotts that were nervy, ennobling and effective. Pacifism seemed to offer a chance for survival to a generation that had been stunted by the fear of nuclear extinction.

I worked as a war reporter, but I never saw a conflict between this and being a Quaker. If my reporting was sometimes drawn more to human details than to the box-score kind of war coverage, those details struck me as critical to explaining war. I never covered a conflict -- whether in Central America, the Caribbean, Africa or the Middle East -- that seriously shook my religious convictions. In fact, most conflicts seemed to prove how war was rotten, wasteful and useless. El <NAME/>'s civil war killed 70,000 people over nine years. It was hard to see how the political compromise that ended the conflict could not have been reached after just six months.
But in the 1990s, I covered the Balkans. In Sarajevo, Srebrenica, and Kosovo, I confronted the logical flaw (or perhaps I should say the fatal flaw) of nonviolent resistance: All the best people can be killed by all the worst ones. I had never believed that pacifism had all the answers; neither does militarism. About half of all draft age Quakers enlisted in World War II, believing that whatever wisdom pacifism had to give the world, it could not defeat the murderous schemes of Adolf Hitler and his cohorts.

It seems to me that in confronting the forces that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, American pacifists have no sane alternative now but to support war. I don't consider this reprisal or revenge, but self-defense: protecting the world from further attacks by destroying those who would launch them.

Some peace activists, their judgment still hobbled by shock, seem to believe that the attacks against New York and Washington were natural disasters: terrible, unpredictable whirlwinds that struck once and will not reoccur.

This is wrong. We know now that there has been an ongoing violent campaign aimed at bringing down diverse nations, with none being more gloriously speckled than the U.S. People who try to hold certain American policies or culture responsible are trying to decorate the crimes of psychotics with synthetic political significance.

In 1933 the Oxford Student Union conducted a famous debate over whether it was moral for Britons to fight for king and country. The exquisite intellects of that leading university reviewed the many ways in which British colonialism exploited and oppressed the world. They cited the ways in which vengeful demands made of Germany in the wake of World War I had helped to kindle nationalism and fascism. They saw no moral difference between Western colonialism and world fascism. The Oxford Union ended that debate with this famous proclamation: "Resolved, that we will in no circumstances fight for king and country."

<NAME/> Ribbentrop sent back the good news to Germany's new chancellor, Hitler: The West will not fight for its own survival. Its finest minds will justify a silent surrender.

In short, the best-educated young people of their time could not tell the difference between the deficiencies of their own nation, in which liberty and democracy were cornerstones, and a dictatorship founded on racism, tyranny and fear.

And what price would those who urge reconciliation today pay for peace? Should Americans impose a unitary religious state, throw women out of school and work, and rob other religious groups of their rights, so that we have the kind of society the attackers accept? Do pacifists really want to live in the kind of world that the terrorists who hit the World Trade Center and Pentagon would make?

Pacifists do not need any lectures about risking their lives to stop wickedness. Quakers resisted slavery by smuggling out slaves when even <NAME/> <NAME/> tried to appease the Confederacy. Pacifists sneaked refugee Jews out of Germany when England and the U.S. were still trying to placate Hitler. Many conscientious objectors have served bravely in gritty and unglamorous tasks that aided the U.S. in time of war.

But those of us who have been pacifists must admit that it has been our blessing to live in a nation in which other citizens have been willing to risk their lives to defend our dissent. The war against terrorism does not shove American power into places where it has no place. It calls on America's military strength in a global crisis in which peaceful solutions are not apparent.
Only American (and British) power can stop more killing in the world's skyscrapers, pizza parlors, embassies, bus stations, ships, and airplanes. Pacifists, like most Americans, would like to change their country in a thousand ways. And the blasts of Sept. 11 should remind American pacifists that they live in that one place on the planet where change -- in fact, peaceful change -- seems most possible. It is better to sacrifice our ideals than to expect others to die for them.

Here's the suggested plan to try to make our weekly calls as efficient, painless and useful as possible.  All other ideas, thoughts, comments, etc., are welcome.

We'll set up a recurring call-in number (for Thursday's at 8:30 AM, i.e., same number every week)
It will be assumed that everyone will call in; no pre-meeting prep necessary.
If someone doesn't call in, it will be assumed that the person has a conflict and can't make it (giving the benefit of the doubt is a virtue).
Those that do call in will conduct the call.  (Again, the assumption is that, save for minor exceptions, everyone will be on the call.)

Thoughts?

I asked if <NAME/> would be lobbying to have the Commission issue a subsequent decision clawing the suspension date back to July 1.

FYI

Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of our gas controllers was stuck in an elevator for approximately 5 hours. Apparently the alarm and the intercom were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours before they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 hours to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the guards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performed on Saturday, as scheduled. Evidentially the level of maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed.  

We are pursuing this matter with <NAME/> <NAME/> and the building/security staff.

Another defeat for <NAME/>.  Tough break.  Is the judge's proposed decision available?
Best,
<NAME/>
FERC Judge Urges Dismissal Of Calif Complaint Vs El Paso
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- An administrative law judge has recommended the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dismiss a complaint alleging El Paso Corp. (EPG) manipulated the market for natural gas sales into California . 
The ruling in the high-profile, politically charged case was a setback for California , which had sought to hold El Paso financially accountable not only for higher natural gas prices, but also for the resulting higher electricity prices in a state heavily dependent upon gas-fired power plants. 
"While ... El Paso Pipeline and El Paso Merchant had the ability to exercise market power, the record in this case isn't at all clear that they in fact exercised market power," <NAME/> Wagner, FERC's chief administrative law judge, concluded in an initial decision forwarded to the commission late Tuesday. 
The California Public Utilities Commission, which filed the complaint against El Paso, said later Tuesday that it would appeal Wagner's decision on market manipulation. 
In a small victory for the state, Wagner did find that El Paso officials violated FERC's "standards of conduct" rules barring the sharing of market-sensitive information between pipeline companies and their natural-gas marketing affiliates. 
"El Paso Corp., El Paso Pipeline, and El Paso Merchant are guilty of affiliate abuse," Wagner concluded. 
"There was a dialogue between the pipeline affiliates and the marketing affiliate that gave an unfair advantage to the bidding" by the marketing unit for El Paso pipeline capacity into California , Wagner said. 
FERC had dismissed the issue of affiliate abuse on March 28 without a hearing. At Wagner's request, the commission later agreed to reopen the issue during a hearing into the market-manipulation complaint. 
The proceeding, which began April 4 and concluded August 6, resulted in a hearing record of 32 volumes and totaled 5,573 pages, while 515 exhibits were entered into evidence, Wagner reported. 
"The briefs measured approximately one linear foot," he said. 
 
     Contracting With Affiliates 
   
At issue are contracts worth $38.5 million that El Paso's marketing unit entered into with its pipeline affiliate to secure 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of firm transportation capacity into California from March 2000 through June 2001. 
California argued El Paso had used its control of pipeline space to limit the supply of gas into the state and boost prices. 
The contract period coincided with an unprecedented period of power-market volatility, in which skyrocketing natural gas costs contributed to extreme spikes in electricity prices that ultimately rendered the state's utilities insolvent. 
The judge found that the contracts gave El Paso Merchant more than a 35% market share, the market-power threshold under FERC's merger guidelines, based on his interpretation of the relevant market. El Paso had argued for the higher antitrust-law threshold of 50%, but Wagner ruled that the lower standard should apply. 
But while that market share gave El Paso the "ability to exercise market power," Wagner said, "it is not at all clear from the record in the proceeding that El Paso Merchant and El Paso Pipeline exercised market power." 
The record offers only mixed support for allegations by the CPUC and utilities in the state that El Paso withheld gas supplies to drive up prices, Wagner said. 
From March through October 2000, El Paso's capacity utilization rate was about half the rate of other shippers, while for the remainder of the contract, the full capacity was used. 
Wagner concluded that El Paso's compliance with FERC rules requiring companies that control pipeline capacity to offer unused capacity to other shippers constituted an effective check against market power. 
 
     Improper Communications Seen 
   
Where the state scored a win was in the second phase of the hearing, where Wagner heard evidence on allegations of affiliate abuse. 
Wagner cited telephone records and correspondence to conclude that El Paso violated FERC rules requiring pipelines and affiliated marketers to operate independently of one another. The rules also restrict communications between pipeline operating personnel and affiliated marketers. 
Transcripts of telephone conversations between pipeline and marketing employees of El Paso "demonstrate blatant collusion ... to keep secret a discount for service" on El Paso's Mojave system until the open season was over in which Merchant was bidding for the pipeline capacity on the sister pipeline, Wagner said, including the transcripts in his opinion. 
Wagner determined that the transcript offered a "prima facie" case of affiliate abuse, and urged El Paso to present witnesses to rebut his finding. But El Paso declined to present the witnesses, the opinion noted. 
Wagner also cited a confidential memorandum to <NAME/> Wise, El Paso's chief executive, from the head of El Paso Merchant as contributing to his conclusion that El Paso and its pipeline and marketing affiliates "were in clear violation" of FERC's affiliate-abuse rules. 
El Paso replied in a statement that the commission had considered the same evidence and found no abuse in its March 28 ruling. The commission would commit a "legal error" if it adopted the judge's views, the company said. 
The parties have 30 days to file briefs taking exception to the judge's findings. The commission can either accept or reject the judge's findings. 
However the commission ultimately rules in the case, it is expected to end up appealed before a federal appeals court.

We need to do something to protect our reputation in the west.  The west is difficult enough to schedule when you are selecting your counterparties, but with EOL, we have become the physical "CUT Clearinghouse" in the west.  Any internal nom errors just make it more difficult to transact reliably on EOL.

Thanks,

Mikey,

I am thinking of going with a townhouse / infill as opposed to an apartement style condo. I am going to look mostly in the Altadore / Killarney area. I think you get more house for your $ there as opposed to West Hillhurst. A couple of people have told me to check out <NAME/> Woods. Have you heard of it? What is the plan for the weekend. You should come down to Red Deer on Friday and have <NAME/>'s with the Dorlands. Maybe we could track down <NAME/> after. Are you taking a chica to the wedding?

Question 1:
When we talk about "the market" reacting to events, what are the prices
that we are talking about? From a simulation standpoint, I am trying to
figure out what prices we need to show as being affected by these many
events.  Is it the forward curve? Is it the spot market price?  Is the
bid/offer prices for the various instruments? And, if we are having users
trade basis, we will need different prices for different locations, right?

[Quigley, Dutch]  
for each event we need to build a change matrix that will change the previous price curve to a new one
depending on each event it could change all parts of the sport and forward curve

Question 2:
Given that the calculation of VaR is rather involved, we decided that it
would not be worth our effort to have that calculation in the model.
However, we understand that the user needs to 1) know their VaR and 2) know
that they need to make sure they stay within their VaR limit.  So, we will
need to set a VaR limit for the user and "fake" the individual VaR to
reflect their risk exposure.

I had a talk with Erro McLaughlin about this.  He made a good point that if
our user are not expected to understand the complexity of how a VaR is
calculated, will they know how to control their VaR, i.e. if a user sees
that he is over his VaR limit, what should he do to get it back within the
limit.  Is is as simple as not being too long or too short? And if that is
the case, would it be sufficient to use position reports/tallies as a proxy
for risk exposure, instead of VaR?

One possible way to fake VaR may be to adjust the VaR number to reflect how
exposed the user is. So if they are X dollars long, they have a VaR of Y.
If they change their position so that they are now 1.5X long, they have a
VaR of 1.5Y.  Perhaps we can also throw in a factor that takes into account
market volatility.

What are your thoughts?

[Quigley, Dutch]  
Instead of a VaR number we could set position limits that they must stay within at all times
i.e. over all position can not be outside a set range , NYMEX Risk can not exceed +/- 500 contracts
Basis & Index Risk can not exceed +/- 1000 contracts so for and so on 
Therefore not having to calculate VaR and expect the user to understand what to do to stay with in limits




Lastly, when could you meet with me next week? I would really like to meet
on Tuesday, if possible.

[Quigley, Dutch]  
can you check with your team , I am to meet with them on Monday and Tues. so see if you can squeeze into one of the times or we can make a new one

Please pass on the sentiments of at least 3 Auburn Alumni.  The students that appear in the pictures from Halloween dressed in racial costumes should be immediately expelled from the University and their respective fraternities should be permanently removed from campus.  We also think that PartyPics.com should be disciplined and removed from the vendor list for the University.  Auburn University and it's related organizations should not contribute money to organizations that are willing to take pictures of such insulting behavior and try and profit from them by selling them to disgusting human beings that would participate in such offensive behavior.

As graduates of Auburn University and Athletic and Academic Scholarship donors, we are appalled by these students behavior and demand immediate action be taken against them.  The longer this issue is not dealt with, the worse our University looks in the eyes of the world.  Please take action and help save Auburn's reputation.  Thanks for your assistance.

<NAME/>--
	As we discussed yesterday, Panda Energy International, Inc. and TECO Energy, Inc. (Tampa Electric) have formed a partnership to build, own, and operate a 2300 Mw gas-fired electric generation plant located in Maricopa County, Arizona, southwest of Phoenix.  The partnership may be called "Panda Gila <NAME/> L.P."

Here are some of the details as we know them:
	All building/ air permits received, construction has commenced
	Financing closed 6/04/01 (oversubscribed by 56%)
	$2.2 bn loan ($1.7bn 5 yr. bullet loan and $500mm equity bridge)
	Financing led by Citibank and Societe Generale
	50% of power output sold under long term contracts, 50% on spot market

What we want to know is:
	How did the banks get comfortable on the financing if only 25% of the gas pipeline transport capacity is under contract? (And right now there is only one pipeline capable of serving the plant's needs)
How did the banks get comfortable with only 50% of the power output sold under long term contracts?

What happens after the bullet loan comes due-- are the operators taking interest rate risk and hoping to refinance at a lower rate in year 5?

Any information you can provide on the above would be very helpful.  We are scheduled to meet with Panda in Dallas on Tuesday 11/6.
thanks for the help.

I talked to <NAME/> Fielder (SVP <NAME/>) about setting up a meeting for <NAME/> Tycholiz with <NAME/>'s CFO about hedging <NAME/>'s QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
<NAME/> is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (<NAME/> is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that <NAME/> "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that <NAME/> intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that <NAME/> is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  <NAME/>'s stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

<NAME/> Krugman has made frequent negative references to <NAME/> and its management in his New York Times column over the last twelve months.  I have refrained from responding until now.  Below (and in the attached in Word format) is a letter I hope you will print.  If you wish to contact me, you can call my office (713.621.6550) or page me (888.906.9761).  Thank you for your consideration.

It's hard to tell what motivates <NAME/> Krugman's frequent attacks on <NAME/> ("<NAME/> Goes Overboard" August 17).  His latest attack is no more than a string of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt.  He reveals, in depth, his ignorance of <NAME/>, the people who work here, and the tragically botched California regulatory regime.  Perhaps he seeks merely to entertain.

	The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the free market system - a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect, and heart. He would apparently rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make choices for people.  We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the integrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.  Ironically, the example Krugman cites of "financialization" run amok (the electricity market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with active government intervention at every step.  Indeed, the only winners in the entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Angeles, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia.  The disaster that squandered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by markets of the many.  So long as Krugman's elitist reasoning prevails, we are doomed to repeat such mistakes.

<NAME/>,

I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with SIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San <NAME/> as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with 8.5" roof panels and use a metal roof.

I have been working with <NAME/> Brown, a builder from San <NAME/> that is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.  That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?   Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference.

Thank you for your help.

<NAME/>,

The 600K is salary, and nonperformance related bonus payouts.  It is NOT guaranteed bonus over and above salary (I wish it was).  Basically, I am 95% certain I will make a minimum of 600K/year with either company, worst case I'm looking at 500K/year (excluding incentive).  Incentive would be in addition to.  My offer would have to be in that ballpark.  If I worked 1/3 the year, assuming a base salary in the 250 to 300 range, I would get 100 less.  Also, I'm not trying to be vague.  Essentially I'm working with 3 moving parts--non of which has become crystal clear yet.  At this point, let's look at this:  2-year contract with an out after 1-year.  $275 base salary.  $225 signing bonus.  $225 retention bonus after 1-year.  If I take it, I'm done for another year.  Participation in the 17% incentive package.  Relocation package.  That seems to be the ballpark we are in.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

okay - so here's the deal - ugh - i hate to say this but we may have to postpone again.  pat's parents were supposed to come last weekend and they didnt because pat's dad was sick, so they are thinking of coming this weekend instead.  they usually leave pretty early on sunday, but with your time constraints with the foleys thing - i dont know if we'll be able to squeeze it in the middle.  i'll let you know if anything changes - if not, it may be back to the drawing board.

Hi My Man,
 
Yokos! mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm    I went to see Dr. Soot today, she told me my pain is from the 2 big knots where they started and ended the incisions, and it will only hurt for ...oh....3 months or so.  She also said I can do whatever I want, including the gym! Your ASS is MINE!  ;)  She said lifting etc is fine as long as I listen to my pain and lift things slowly. No jerky or quick lifting that could hurt me.

Hey <NAME/>,

Good to hear from you.  It is pretty bad at <NAME/>.  I still have a job for the time being but things are in limbo right now.  The good news is that my division (trading ops) is the most valuable and desirable for any acquisition.  The bad news is that we could declare bankruptcy at any time and that would leave our fate in the hands of the creditors and the courts.  It is sad to see a good company like this fold despite the fact that we make a great deal of money.  
Oh well, things will work out.

As far as the <NAME/> Bowl, I think we have a pretty good shot.  Currently we are 3rd in the BCS rankings (the top two go to the National Championship game -- which is the <NAME/> Bowl this year).  The two teams ahead of us are Miami (1) and Florida (2).  If either one loses (Miami at <NAME/> Tech this week and Florida vs Tennesee and possible SEC championship game) we should get into the top 2.  Of course, we have to win on Saturday as well.  This has been a wacky year in college football, so I think our chances are pretty good.

Good luck on the proposal.  You are about to venture to the Dark Side.  Telluride should be fun.  We went there last year for a ski trip (again).  I might be venturing down that path soon.

I should be here when you are in town so drop me a line or give me a call (H: 713-661-2601 or Cell:713-628-3104 or Work (hopefully): 713-853-0977).  

Take Care.
