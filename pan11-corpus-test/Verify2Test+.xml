Yes and no.
I think in many ways he is very similar to us.  This is the lifestyle he has always led since college.  To settle down and lay roots somewhere is something that I know from talking with him pulls at his conscience often, that he wants at many levels....but is unfamiliar and therefore scary for him to consider doing.  

Just like our desire to live that kind of lifestyle...seemingly free, having only enough money to get you to the next destination...is extinguished by our practicality about things like retirement...providing for a family...and having money to do things that require money to do like ski trips, alaska, etc.

I think this just goes to show how difficult it is to make major lifestyle changes that go against years of living and thinking differently.  Not just adapting to new creature comforts but changing one's mindset...which is scary...and difficult.  

More than you bargained for in a response eh? 
We are leaving here at 11ish..the flight leaves at 1pm.  I'll give you a call before we board the plane.

Went OK.  I gave <NAME/> a few issues that need to be worked on.

1) Imports/Exports do not seem to be getting captured inFSP.
2)SC trades - some ponts other than CAlifornia were being captured.

Some progress was made on Generation.  If entered in Enpower correctly,they appear in FSP. The only problem is once we enter deals in enpower at detailed points, The enpower to caps report does not balance.  We need Enpower to caps to be reformulated to include all NP SP and ZP deals including those at detailed points like sdg1,pandol_6_unit, etc.

        Weekend Update: Go easy on yourself and others Friday. Set aside tight schedules and worries. Take things as they come, without getting bogged down in impossible expectations. Delays and adjustments are very likely. Saturday is excellent for making sense out of Friday's events. Calmly piece together fragments until they assume some sort of order. It is so important that you consciously forgive those who have disappointed or inconvenienced you or your loved ones. Hanging onto resentment will tear holes in your heart. Sunday brings bliss. Doubt is replaced with a comforting sense that all will be fine in time. Private talks with loved ones bring healing and emotional intimacy. In fact, you may experience a gratifying breakthrough in one of your most important relationships. Encourage your significant other to relax, dream, and cultivate hope. Things will evolve in wondrous ways. Graciously accept the unasked for changes entering your life and let the transformation begin. . . .

Guten Morgen!!!

How was your weekend?  We had the long Memorial Day weekend here....hahaha!

Things are fine here.  I just tried to relax this weekend.  Friday night I went to a movie with Rayfael. We saw Angel Eyes with <NAME/> Lopez.  It was pretty good.  Saturday, I pretty much just vegged out a good chunk of the day.  <NAME/> and I went to lunch and ran errands.  I went running every day this weekend, too!  I've lost 10 lbs since the big breakup!!!  Down to 145 now, may go for 140 - not sure.  I didn't go out on Saturday because I was just in a mood to stay in.  Sunday, I took care of some stuff around the house.  I wasn't really planning to go out, but one of my new friends, <NAME/>, called and wanted me to meet him and some other folks out at a bar, so I went at about 9:00.  Well, you know how 1 or 2 drinks always turns into alot more...I ended up staying there pretty late and having a good time.  I crashed at <NAME/>'s house and got back to mine at about 7:00 am.  So all the work I'd done on getting caught up on sleep was ruined!!!  I came home and got right in bed, but the dogs really wouldn't let me sleep much.  I went over to <NAME/>'s yesterday to get instructions on taking care of her cats this week.  She leaves Wednesday for Prague and gets back next Thursday.

Now it's back to work, but it's a short week at least.  I'm getting more and more used to the fact that I'm single now, and even though I'd like me and Rayfael to get back together - it's nothing I'm gonna be able to push, if it happens, it happens.  I really hope it does, but the best thing for me is not to push it.  So, in the meantime, I guess I'm a free agent!  That feels weird...but, oh well.

Anyway, how are things there?

I'm sorry I haven't been more involved is setting this up, but I think the agenda looks kond of soft.  At a minimum, I would like to turn the schedule around and hit the hard subjects like Q3, risk management, and asset sales first.  I would also like to see a discussion on our funds flow, cash flow, and our balance sheet.  If we don't get these things right, none of the rest of it matters.
 
Also, I notice that <NAME/> Olson and <NAME/> Tilney are in attendance.  This should only be for presentation, as they are not members of the management committee.

Hi Nik
 
 
This is the nasty side of American business.  There is nothing to be embarassed or discouraged about.  These are hard times and I think your graduation timing is no help either.  People graduating '98 through '00 had it goood.  But hang in there, opportunities are fewer, but they are out there.  You might want to broaden your search into energy and healthcare.
 
<NAME/> is one heck of a story. What a ride !  The only conclusion I have is, next time I see some professor about efficient stock markets, I am going to smack him bad. As hard it is to manage businesses in trouble, it is not easy to manage businesses which are over-valued either. There is huge propensity for management to be complacent and attribute it to themselves, while it might be the investors folly and nothing more.  I have been on the ride up and down and all I can say is you live and you learn.
 
I will look out for opportunities out here. <NAME/> is trying to stay close to core businesses but the energy industry in general is still hiring and complacent. You keep at it bud, and things are going to get better.  This market economy beast can be hard to handle at times but in the end it works out. Say hi to <NAME/> and <NAME/>.

Kamp,

Did you watch the Astros / Giants game last night.  It was embarrassing.  I've never
seen such a cowardly performance by a baseball team (of course I'm talking abt the
Astros).  When do you ever walk a guy with runners on 1st and 2nd, your team is 
down by 1 run and there is 2 outs?  Answer:  NEVER.  According to Dierker,
"... the critical walk was the one with runners on first and second," Dierker said. "We did that because <NAME/> <NAME/> was 3-for-17 against <NAME/> and had struck out the last five at-bats (against him), so he showed some dominance against him. Obviously, you don't want to put another runner on base and move the runners another base in scoring position unless you have a very compelling reason, and we did.

How's long's this clown been managing.  I guess he hasn't followed <NAME/> the last few years.  It wasn't like he was walking Bonds to get to 
<NAME/> DeJesus.  He doesn't even have the sack to admit he fucked up.  I've never seen fans boo their home team so much since the days of <NAME/> <NAME/>.

Have you and <NAME/> been getting any sleep? How's <NAME/>?

I don't know anything about CES trades being sold to New Power Co.  I looked in TAGG at the trades in the spreadsheet, and they look like normal swaps.  No one has called before this to say confirms were not signed or anything of that nature, so I can't see any reason they have not to pay.

Let me know how I can help.

That sounds great!  So will they get it all spread in one day?  Sounds like everything is taking shape now!!!

Not much going on here.  I had dinner with Rayfael last night, it was a little painful, but I survived.  He's so messed up
in the head right now.  :(

Anyway, nothing too exciting happening here....at least nothing that's gonna cheer you up...

Still here, but don't know for how long...

I still can't believe the arrogant assholes who have run this company into the ground.  Because our credit rating keeps dropping, our trading abilities are being adversely affected.  I don't know how long things will be able to go on at this rate.  We may not make it to the end of the year, Dynegy deal or not.  I'm hopeful that the remaining finance people can refinance our debt, but if they don't, it doesn't look good....

Oh, well.  We'll all just move on and look for other jobs.  

Oh, by the way, we just moved into the new building this past weekend.  We're sitting near the power trading arrogant assholes.

<NAME/> everything is going well for you.  How is your house coming along??  Send me a note back.  I'm going to be out tomorrow but will be back in on Monday.  They start laying off people next week.  It won't be in gas and power, but in other areas of the corporation.  <NAME/> Christmas!!

Take care,

Made the ganache last night...tastes great...do you glaze it on the cake or frost the cake?  It said frosting..but to me it looked glazeable.
Ran to make a cake during lunch to pick up last few things.  What do you think about baking 2 12x2 cakes in one oven at the same time...staggering the pans?  I was wondering if it wouldn't bring down the oven temp because it might interfere with the air circulation in the oven.  Oh well...not sure what I'm going to do.  My plan is to bake the cakes tonight.  Everything is already measured.  I am crossing my fingers that my oven doesn't wig out.....last night it did when i was making financiers.......my oven is very temperamental...though it has been good lately.  Talk to you soon.

We are totally LBs. no DEs. We had a bad defensive game, which I hope turns around next week,
as we have good people at those positions. Our defense has been one of the best.
PumpnGD had a lucky defensive game, but
he has good people as well. Our head-to-head with him in 2 weeks is key. <NAME/> <NAME/>
is a bye for him, so he picked up Watters. But you saw last night how dominant Shaun

   A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN                                                 
                                                                                
   NEW YORK (DOW JONES)--THE CALIFORNIA SENATE IN SACRAMENTO PASSED A           
WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX ON SALES OF ELECTRICITY INTO THE STATE'S WHOLESALE         
ELECTRICITY MARKET MONDAY AFTERNOON AT 4:50 P.M. PDT. AT ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME
TIME, CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR INITIATED ROLLING BLACKOUTS FOR THE
FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH.                                                         
   COINCIDENCE? PROBABLY, BUT THE CONNECTION SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED.              
   "THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA TO DATE HAVE      
ACCELERATED AN ALREADY SERIOUS MARKET COLLAPSE," SAID A HARVARD UNIVERSITY STUDY
OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CRISIS LATE LAST MONTH.                                  
   THIS WEEK'S WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX BILL IS THE LATEST BLUNT INSTRUMENT WIELDED 
WITH POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS RESULTS. GOV. GRAY DAVIS WANTED IT AS A STICK WHEN  
                                                                          (CONT)
MEETING WITH EXECUTIVES FROM THE STATE'S MERCHANT POWER COMPANIES WEDNESDAY. THE
MANEUVER WAS LESS THAN ADROIT, AND THE GENERATORS WEREN'T IMPRESSED.            
   AFTER THE MEETING WITH DAVIS, RELIANT ENERGY'S (REI) JOHN STOUT SAID THAT IF 
THE TAX WERE IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA, IT WOULD "INSTANTLY BLACK OUT ALL THE   
GENERATION IN THE STATE."                                                       
   THE STATE'S LEADERS MIGHT KEEP IN MIND WHO WIELDS THE BIGGER STICK AT THIS   
POINT. CALIFORNIA SET UP A MARKET IN WHICH SELLERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE VERY
HIGH PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY SINCE SUPPLIES STARTED GETTING TIGHT A YEAR AGO.    
SELLERS SAY THEY HAVE PLAYED BY THE RULES THEY WERE GIVEN, AND NOBODY HAS PROVED
OTHERWISE WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF A FINE PAID BY WILLIAMS COMPANIES (WMB) FOR 
ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF VIOLATING A CONTRACT.                                
   "IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY INVENTED A NEW GAME, INVITED YOU OVER TO PLAY AND THEN   
CHANGED THE RULES A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME. THEN, AFTER YOU  
BEAT THEM, THEY INSIST YOU CHEATED," SAID ONE WESTERN ENERGY TRADER.            
   ALMOST EVERY ATTEMPT BY THE BUY SIDE - THE UTILITIES, THE ISO AND NOW THE    
                                                                          (CONT)
STATE TREASURY - TO LOWER PRICES HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER PRICES OR BLACKOUTS OR  
BOTH. THE WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX IDEA IS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE, BUT THOSE WHO   
INSIST ON PRICE CAPS SHOULD KEEP THIS IN MIND: THE ISO HAS HAD PRICE CAPS SINCE 
IT BEGAN OPERATION MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO. OBVIOUSLY, PRICE CAPS HAVEN'T     
WORKED, JUST AS THEY HAVE NEVER WORKED EXCEPT DURING WARTIME.                   
   IN FACT, PRICE CAPS HAVE BEEN A QUESTIONABLE MEDICINE PRESCRIBED FOR THE     
WRONG DISEASE. AT BEST, PRICE CAPS MIGHT RESTRICT PRICE SPIKES. CALIFORNIA'S    
PROBLEM IS PERPETUAL HIGH PRICES. IT CAN'T AFFORD THE GOING RATE AT NIGHTTIME,  
LET ALONE THE HIGHER MARKET PRICES DURING THE AFTERNOONS IN A HEATWAVE.         
   CALIFORNIA MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY BETTER THE GAME IT INVENTED. THE      
INSANELY COMPLICATED COMPUTER-BASED PURCHASING OF POWER ENDED A FEW MONTHS AGO, 
AFTER THE CALIFORNIA POWER EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED DOWN BY FEDERAL REGULATORS AND   
THE ISO LOST ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO BUY POWER. THE MATCH BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS 
AND THE ENERGY TRADERS WASN'T EXACTLY IBM'S "BIG BLUE" VERSUS GARRY KASPAROV.   
   ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE MARKET AGREES THAT THE UTILITIES' HUMAN TRADERS COULD 
                                                                          (CONT)
HAVE BOUGHT NEEDED POWER FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LESS THAN THE PROGRAMS THAT THE
UTILITIES WERE REQUIRED TO USE BY STATE LAW.                                    
   SINCE THE DEMISE OF PROGRAMMED PURCHASING, THE COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED  
BY HUMANS, BUT WITHOUT MUCH BETTER RESULTS. THE TEAM ASSEMBLED TO BUY TENS OF   
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF SPOT POWER EVERY DAY CONSISTS MOSTLY OF FORMER     
EMPLOYEES OF THE POWER EXCHANGE AND ISO, AS WELL AS EXPENSIVE CONSULTANTS WITH  
NO ENERGY TRADING EXPERIENCE. ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE TRADING TEAM, FOR       
EXAMPLE, IS A FORMER PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE POWER EXCHANGE WITH NO   
TRADING EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT JOB.                                    
   AS ONE ISO EMPLOYEE WAS WONT TO SAY: "IT'S LIKE WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME     
BETWEEN NOTRE DAME AND ST. MARY'S SCHOOL FOR UNWED MOTHERS."                    
   AND THE SIGNING OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FIVE- AND 10-YEAR CONTRACTS
IS BEING EXECUTED MAINLY BY FORMER EXECUTIVES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON -   
PEOPLE THAT LEFT THE UTILITY YEARS AGO TO BECOME CONSULTANTS AND ALSO DON'T HAVE
TRADING EXPERIENCE.                                                             
   GOOD IDEAS, MEANWHILE, HAVE LANGUISHED.                                (CONT)
   "WE ARE GOING TO INSTALL METERS IN EVERY MAJOR COMMERCIAL CONCERN IN THE     
STATE THIS SUMMER AND GO TO REAL-TIME PRICING," DAVIS TOLD WALL STREET ANALYSTS 
ON FEB. 28.                                                                     
   THAT PROPOSAL WAS GREETED BY MANY OBSERVERS AS THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE IDEA    
FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO DATE.                                             
   WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO REAL-TIME PRICING FOR CALIFORNIA'S BIG BUSINESSES SINCE 
THEN? NOTHING.                                                                  
   "THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA IS 'SPECIAL'," SAID STANFORD    
ECONOMIST AND CALIFORNIA ISO CONSULTANT FRANK WOLAK. EVERY INDUSTRY FROM OIL    
REFINERS TO INTERNET SERVER FARMS HAS HAD LOBBYISTS IN SACRAMENTO SUCCESSFULLY  
SECURING EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE.                                                
   "MY POINT HAS BEEN THAT IF WHAT THEY DO IS SO VALUABLE, THEN THEY SHOULD BE  
ABLE TO HANDLE THE HIGHER PRICES. BUSINESSES WITH ABOUT 10,000 MEGAWATTS OF LOAD
HAVE REAL-TIME METERS. EVERY ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE GETTING MARKET PRICES," SAID 
WOLAK.                                                                          
                                                                          (CONT)
   ONE OF THE GREATEST ADVANTAGES THAT SELLERS OF ELECTRICITY TO CALIFORNIA HAVE
HAD IS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE FIXED PRICES, SO DEMAND IS INFLEXIBLE. SELLERS KNOW  
EXACTLY HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY THE UTILITIES MUST BUY BASED ON TEMPERATURES AND   
THE TIME OF DAY, WOLAK SAYS, AND THEY SIMPLY SUPPLY THE MARKET JUST ENOUGH POWER
AT HIGH MARGINAL PRICES.                                                        
   REDUCING OVERALL CONSUMPTION THROUGH HIGHER RATES WILL HELP THE STATE SOME,  
BUT MAKING 25% OF DEMAND FLEXIBLE BASED ON PRICE WOULD GIVE THE STATE A FIGHTING
CHANCE IN THE MARKET, ACCORDING TO WOLAK.                                       
   BUT THAT, APPARENTLY, IS TOO COMPLICATED OR POLITICALLY DIFFICULT. PRICE     
CAPS, A WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX AND POLITICAL PATRONAGE JOBS FOR BUYING BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS OF POWER MAY NOT SAVE THE STATE FROM BANKRUPTCY, BUT THEY ARE EASIER TO 
SELL - OR SLIP THROUGH - IN SACRAMENTO.

My accomplishments for the first six months of 2001 include the following:

1.    Developed New EES Trading Forms -- provided key legal technology and intellectual capital to rewrite EES forms to be largely consistent with the wholesale trading forms.

2.   Developed Setoff and Netting Strategy in the PG&E Bankruptcy -- led legal and credit team across all <NAME/> entities in minimizing <NAME/> credit and legal risks.  This required an expedited evaluation of <NAME/> positions and coordination across <NAME/> entities to determine the best possible approach to terminate and then value all PG&E contracts.

3.    Implemented New Document Retention Policy for Microsoft Outlook -- led the resolution of many critical document retention policy issues and implementation of a new policy across company lines in <NAME/>. 

4.    Thought Leader on Legal Risk Managment -- continued to develop legal technology for better management and reporting of legal risks across <NAME/>.  Legal Risk Memos and legal risk ratings are two examples.  These legal risk policies have been newly applied in South America and EES to better evaluate and manage the legal risks in those businesses.

5.     Developing New Businesses -- integral part in developing new businesses in freight, paper, steel, lumber, etc. by preparing trading forms and formulating new ways to manage legal risks.

6.     Deal Machine -- projects having lots of complex issues including LV Cogen II, Pastoria, Sithe, Invasion Energy, Electrobolt and Huntco.

7.     Management -- continued to build a deal-oriented legal team that understand the underlying businesses.

8.     New Generation of Master Agreeements -- taking the lead with ISDA in developing the next generation of trading master which would be a single master for all commodities, whether physical or financial.  This would reduce the legal work by half.

	Thanks for forwarding the attached message. The way I read this, PSNM is effectively withdrawing its demand for the collateral as long as we don't use the contract. We should probably send them a letter confirming that this is the case. I would suggest that you just send an e-mail in response stating that what PSNM has proposed is acceptable and that our understanding is that PSNM will not require collateral as long as we don't utilize the contract. Therefore, PSNM's demand for collateral by December 15 is, based on our understanding, withdrawn. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.

The power prices are not financially settled, they are settled by physical delivery, the gas prices are settled against 'Gas Daily' index. What we will need to also look at is, the contractual provision, for 2003 onwards, when the RTO is expected to kick in.
 
Also, lets look at some other term sheets and make a more robust one. What might be a good idea is to call <NAME/> Llodra and see if he has any old ones he could mail us.

I understand, but this is a difficult measure to build into a budget system, other than simply limiting the amount of capital you have available to meet your IBIT target.  We can't allow a dicision to cut IBIT by 90% and capital by 95% and call it a success.  The easiest way to control deployment of capital is thru a deal approval process.

i understand it perfectly!!!  it's saying the following:

I'm sorry to hear about your empoyer's relatives....it sounds like that Connie woman is really evil!  I hope she doesn't hit you anymore.  I do agree that you should put a spell on her.  In the meantime, I will think bad thoughts about her.

It's paraphrased, but you get the gist of it....

hehehe

Dear <NAME/>,

I enjoyed your article. You are right, we are a little sensitive.  That's a natural reaction when something you are so proud of is criticized.  I must admit I almost e-mailed you after reading your pre-game article.  What irritates my sensitivities is when it is pointed out that NU players have had trouble with the law.  These episodes, misdeameanors or not are not something any husker fan is proud of.  Surely there are players in every program who have fights with their girlfriends, or who drink too much and don't have the sense to leave a party when asked.  My problem is that whenever a NU player messes up, it is news.  It's as if there is a <NAME/> Journal Star reporter with an office in the <NAME/> PD complete with scanners, just waiting for some "news" to break.  I don't think ISU or any other school has such a spotlight put on them.  College kids everywhere do such things and pay for them quietly.  I don't wish we knew about every infraction at every school.  It would be nice if reporters could put things in perspective and stick to the event they are covering.  This all started when we were the defending and still contending National Champions who had the leading Heisman candidate in the backfield.  The <NAME/> Phillips issue back then was news because of the Heisman hype and because of the severity of his offense.  He became the posterboy for abuse of females, and perhaps rightfully so, but enough already.  Leave us alone until, God forbid, we end up with another <NAME/> Phillips.

Before I ramble on about this sensitive issue.  Let me thank you for your post game article which was fair and balanced.  You are right, Most NU fans are good, a few of us are not good fans or role models.   NU fans continue to wish ISU and Iowa the best.  Most of us are happy to see the Iowa teams do well.  Take care.

Yes, I ran his book for a while when he was head of the gas floor.  I've done some other projects for him.  <NAME/> the e-mail wasn't too bad.

Looking at the entire transport curve was very beneficial.  They have definitely tilted the majority of costs for most areas to the Dec - Feb time frame, which is representative of this type of retail market.  On average for the season and/or the year, the transport costs are reasonable.  Let me know if I can provide any other help.

Hi, Connie!  

The trading groups (the ones that used to make all the money) are still working full days.  We're trying to trade, but our number of counterparties decreases daily.  I don't know if we'll make it through the next week.  They are laying off people this week, so I hear, in other groups.  I don't know who has been notified.  We may all be walking out the door soon.

As for the kids, Yes, <NAME/> still believes in Santa Claus.  I don't know if she knows and is not fessing up!  We'll be here in <NAME/> for Christmas.  Give us a call when you get here; we'd love to see you.  

Thank goodness I already bought the kids' Christmas gifts.  They haven't written their lists yet, though.  

We went to a dude ranch in Bandera, TX for Thanksgiving weekend.  The kids had a blast and want to go back next year.  

I guess I'll be updating my resume this weekend.  It looks pretty bleak.

Talk to you soon.

<NAME/>
