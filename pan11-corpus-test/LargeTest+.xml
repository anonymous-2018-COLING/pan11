The first problem is finding the time and money to do something and given everything else that is going on,  right now is not the best time to be spending some money.   To get the outside contractor taken care of we would have to let GSS find us a party to do the work, so you might want to be thinking of other parties who might be qualified to do the work.

[1] Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash 
After a three-month honeymoon, the new California Power Authority 
is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the Legislature 
looking into its deals, the California Energy Commission annoyed with its 
monopolizing ventures and the Department of Water Resources rebuffing 
its plan to sell its power through state contracts. Other than skepticism 
from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority 
escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and 
fuel cells at [18]. 
[18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority 
(from [1]) 
Is the California Power Authority a dangerously 
out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting 
back some state control over electricity supplies? 
The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the 
Power Authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter 
and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. 
The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember 
<NAME/> Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair 
of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker <NAME/> 
Hertzberg (D-<NAME/> Nuys). Both members were princi-pal 
authors of the Power Authority's enabling legisla-tion, 
SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the 
Energy Foundation's unpaid role in devel-oping 
the Power Authority's requests for bids, particularly 
the RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany, 
Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy 
Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps 
between Capstone and the Energy Foundation. 
Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer 
Power and Conservation Financing Authority. 
Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and 
heads of other agencies the Power Authority must 
work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose 
Power Authority overtures. <NAME/> Hannigan, di-rector 
of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed 
Power Authority board chair <NAME/> <NAME/>'s pro-posal 
to have it buy peaker output. California Energy 
Commission members said they are at policy odds 
with the Power Authority's siting plans. 
In an October 4 letter to <NAME/>, Hannigan said 
that the Power Authority's power-wind and fossil 
peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not 
able to respond quickly enough to balancing power 
needs. "The letters of intent already approved by the 
Power Authority could far exceed [DWR's] ability to ab-sorb 
that power given the outlook for net-short need." 
<NAME/> assumes that the market for Power Authority 
power will be via contract, not the spot market. "Selling 
on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky," said 
Power Authority spokesperson <NAME/> Pasricha. 
The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently 
in the position of actually being able to acquire 
new energy as the state's $12.5 billion bond issue to 
underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in 
limbo and the California Independent System Operator 
is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority 
cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic 
house in order, and an Assembly investigation might 
jeopardize that [J.A. Savage].

I regret that I will miss the first Global Accounting Steering Committee Meeting on Tuesday, May 15.  I am taking that day as a vacation day while my parents are in <NAME/> for <NAME/>'s piano recital.

</body>
</text>

<text file="LargeTest+//a1008.xml">
  <body>

Below is the draft of our governance which I think works.  Let me know your thoughts and possibly we can discuss at this morning's meeting.  I will be participating by phone from the airport as I am on my way to Stamford.  


As we move forward we have two huge tasks to complete at the same time, the integration with UBS Warburg and the re-start of our business.    The UBS corporate governance facilitates the creation of several committees which will meet on a regular basis to resolve issues and report on progress.  Within the UBS framework we will be creating a 'Transitional Steering Committee',  'Integration Committee' and 'Gas and Power Operating Committee'.  

UBS has already created the Integration Committee which we will merge into.  

<NAME/> Forster will be attending all of these groups in the early weeks to ensure consistency and good communication.  <NAME/> will also act as our point person for <NAME/> Bridges from UBS, ensuring the simplest and most effective methods of communication are in place for both parties.

This email outlines the governance structure that will be formalized with immediate effect:

1.	Transitional Steering Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the overall management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.
Committee Members:
<NAME/> Hutchins (co-chair)
<NAME/> Whalley (co-chair)
<NAME/> Kitchen
<NAME/> O'<NAME/>
<NAME/> Bolin
Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis until shortly after the Launch Date, and then bi-monthly thereafter until December 31 2002.
Minutes will be distributed to senior UBS and <NAME/> management only.
Proposed Time	- Wednesday 8:30am CST

2.	Integration Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the day-to-day management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.  Any issues, which this committee cannot resolve, will be escalated to the Transitional Steering Committee.  

Proposed UBS Energy Committee Members:
<NAME/> Kitchen (co-chair)
<NAME/> O'<NAME/> (co-chair)
<NAME/> Bridges 
<NAME/> Beck  - Operations
<NAME/> Haedicke - Legal
<NAME/> Colwell - Financial Operations
<NAME/> <NAME/> - Credit
<NAME/> Port - Market Risk
<NAME/> Webb - IT
<NAME/> Rub - Infrastructure
<NAME/> Keohane - Canada
<NAME/> Forster - ubswenergy.com 
UBS counterparties
Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis until reviewed at December 31 2002.
Minutes will be distributed to the Transitional Steering Committee and team members as appropriate.
Time - Thursday 9:00am CST

3. 	Gas and Power Operating Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the operational running of the Gas and Power Trading business.   The initial focus of this group will be the re-starting of the business. Following the relaunch the purpose of the Management Committees will be to push through its strategic plans and targets globally, to be able to react to market changes quickly, and provide a forum for communication across all locations.  These committees should also maintain, and develop further, any synergies between the Gas and Power Business and other UBS businesses.

Proposed Committee Members:
<NAME/> Kitchen (co-chair)
<NAME/> Whalley (co-chair)
<NAME/> Belden
<NAME/> Calger
<NAME/> Lavorato
<NAME/> Presto
<NAME/> Shively
<NAME/> Milnthorp
Plus ad hoc members of the Logistical support functions as and when required.
?Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis but not before March 2002.

Prior to March 2002, this committee will be replaced by two sub-committees - the Operational Re-start Sub-Committee and the Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee.

3(i)		Operational Restart Sub-Committee 
This subcommittee will be responsible for ensuring that the support functinality is full available at the restart date.

Proposed Sub-Committee Members:
<NAME/> Kitchen (co-chair)
<NAME/> O'<NAME/> (co-chair)
<NAME/> Bridges 
<NAME/> Beck  - Operations
<NAME/> Haedicke - Legal
<NAME/> Colwell - Financial Operations

Proposed Logistics:
This sub-committee will meet weekly until disbanded.
Time Tuesday 8:00am CST

3(ii)	Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee

Proposed Sub-Committee Members:
<NAME/> Kitchen
<NAME/> Murtaugh - UBS Legal

Sorry I haven't gotten back to you. As you can Imagine things around here have been a little nuts. Just wanted to drop you a line and say hi. Everything with me is fine and I have several options in front of me. The next few months will probably be pretty frustrating but I am confident everything will work out in the end. As far a snowboarding I'm not sure if I am going to be able to get out before christmas.

Per <NAME/> Hayslett, you are able to process changes to list B to accommodate instances in which Dynegy & ETS can agree on the specific assignment of an individual.

<NAME/> Buehler and <NAME/> DaSilva are both currently company 179 employees.  We moved both of these individuals to list C because we anticipated that one of the two might need to stay to support deal capture/contracts/data requests for TW.  <NAME/> Buehler has subsequently indicated his plans to leave the company if he is not assigned to list B.  <NAME/> Neubauer has requested that <NAME/> be moved to list B and both <NAME/> Dietz (<NAME/>'s immediate supervisor) and I are in agreement.  And, if we agree to move <NAME/> to list B, we need to make the same accommodation for <NAME/> DaSilva.  <NAME/> Neubauer is in agreement with this revision as well.  

Accordingly, please move <NAME/> Buehler and <NAME/> DaSilva from List C to List B.

FYI - we will use another contract position vacancy to cover TW deal capture/contracts/data requests if deemed necessary.

Attached for your review and comments is a draft of TW's response to the FERC data request in the USGT negotiated rate proceeding. Please note that our response to Data Request No. 1, contemplates that we will provide to FERC copies of the other bids that were received on this capacity. We could attempt to summarize this other bids, but I think the better approach is to just provide copies. 

A schedule of actual volumes transported and actual rates charged USGT is attached (this is the Schedule C that is referenced in our response to Data Request No. 4). This will need to be updated next week prior to filing. I do not have the other attachments to the responses in electronic format. I can of course provide paper copies of these to anyone who would like to see them.

I think that since we are targeting some commercial support groups (legal and accounting), we should broaden the term "business unit" to include business unit or functional group.

Good Afternoon,

I have attempted several times to make a test tag today, but the drop down lists for the PSE's in the Physical path area have not been populated.

We've experienced an unprecedented number of emergency situations during the past several months (weather, terrorist attacks, internet outages, etc.), all of which has been handled quite well by our market services group.  With the last two incidents being so close occurring within one week our Market Services Group has been worked to the limit.  So, if you have the opportunity, put in a kind and supportive word to a scheduler, take a gas controller to lunch, buy a customer rep. a drink (or two) , do what you can to recognize their efforts.

Here is a list and the status of the customers I'm dealing with concerning the El Paso Transportation;



Texaco-I have sent the presentation to my rep (<NAME/> Duval) he is trying to arrange a telephone conversation with the appropriate parties within Texaco
Devon-I have sent the presentation to Devon and have had discussions on the subject.  They seem to be somewhat interested but will be slow to move.  They have committed all their San <NAME/> production until April 2002.
Amoco- Talked to my rep who referred me on to the San <NAME/> trader, these two are not very interested, however <NAME/> Fuller has a contact at Amoco who seems to like the theory.
Reliant-I have had multiple conversations with these guys they are not very interested in this capacity.

Playboy Online staff cutbacks

Playboy Enterprises  plans to cut about a third of the jobs in 
its online division, according to the Wall Street Journal. As 
part of a company streamlining, a spokeswoman for the media 
company said 44 jobs are being eliminated in its online unit. 
Playboy Online had revenue of $13.1 million in the first six 
months of the year, and counts 95,000 paying subscribers to its 
service. "We're not a particularly ad-driven company, but we can 
look at the financial outlook as well as the next person, and we 
look at the economy and want to make sure we can weather it 
well," the spokeswoman told the Journal.

The decision was made last Friday that June 1 would be the closing date for the sale of HPL to AEP (there had been some discussion about moving the close date to July 1).  <NAME/> Redmond has compiled a list of action items to be completed before the close.  <NAME/> Hall is leading this effort for operations and we do not anticipate any problems meeting the June 1 date.  As I explained earlier, our involvement will continue with HPL through June, as invoicing and cash collection for the production month of May will be handled in June.  After the end of June, their may be some involvement on our part in following up on any unpaid invoices or answering customer questions regarding activity prior to June 1.  The effort on our part should diminish substantially after June 30.

We have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible.  I am working on producing a fuller list for you today.  However, there is one particular contract/licence which does require special treatment - Power Marketing Licence to be granted by FERC.  In order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future.
 
Our current strategy is as follows (all dates are approximate)
 
Present - January 10th, 2002        Complete filing documentation
January 11th                                Visit with FERC (One of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer)
January 13th                                 File and request an expedited process
 
It would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the Head of our Regulatory Group (<NAME/> Steffes) to co-ordinate with at Citi.

Hi, Dana:

We have received the original copy of the ISDA Master Agreement.  In looking through the supporting documents, we noted two outstanding items:

1.	We did not receive an original signed IRS Tax Form W-9 as required pursuant to Part 3(a); and

2.	The Certificate of Incumbency we received was not an original and was dated November 14, 2000.  We would like to receive an original certificate dated a current date.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact either <NAME/> or me.  We look forward to receiving this documentation.

Jamie --

Thank you for keeping me in the loop on your activities.  While I am always supportive of more public statements pushing competition, neither I nor <NAME/> can sign on to the letter.  

First, I am concerned that having <NAME/> sign on will distract from your messages.  <NAME/> is a "hot button" in DC and will change the proper focus.

In addition, I would argue that the recommendation for a national commission is out of place with the current timing of FERC and Congressional action -- which is imminent -- while a commission would delay action on the Hill and at FERC, thus supporting the forces against competition.  Let's not study this too much - we know what to do.  Move away from the commission.

Also, I'm not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that promote competition supports our efforts.  Making GA pay for PA is a distraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill.

Finally, I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies will only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry.  While <NAME/> wants markets that work well, the core problem is that we haven't deregulated enough - not that markets aren't working. 

Also, I don't know where the recommendation numbers from the Bush/Cheney plan came from -- I think it was an earlier document -- there are no such numbers in the final printed version of the report that I have.

If you want to talk, please let me know.

Thanks,

Attached is a file from EOL that has all the current products.  We are trying to do a mass mapping for the systems of all of these products.  As you mentioned, not all of these products will roll out initially, but we wanted to go ahead and map them in the system.  I have put in the old trader's names in a column(column F).  If you could check out the list when you get a chance and let me know if you want to change the traders on any of the products and who will be trading the products for the traders that are not moving over(names highlighted in green).  Also, there are no current products under <NAME/> Wolfe, <NAME/> Smith or <NAME/> Tholt.  Please let me know if we need to create products for them or if we will be moving existing ones to them.  Please also let me know which traders need to also have a physical book.  The list I gave you this morning is the financial books we set up.

Cows and World Order

 A CHRISTIAN: You have two cows. You keep one and give
 one to your neighbor.

 A REPUBLICAN: You have two cows. Your neighbor has none.
 So what?

 A DEMOCRAT: You have two cows. Your neighbor has none.
 You feel guilty for being successful. You vote people
 into office who tax your cows, forcing you to sell one
 to raise money to pay the tax. The people you voted for
 then take the tax money and buy a cow and give it to
 your neighbor. You feel righteous.

 A SOCIALIST: You have two cows. The government takes one
 and gives it to your neighbor.

 A COMMUNIST: You have two cows. The government seizes
 both and provides you with milk.

 A FASCIST: You have two cows. The government seizes both
 and sells you the milk. You join the underground and
 start a campaign of sabotage.

 DEMOCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. The
 government taxes you to the point you have to sell both
 to support a man in a foreign country who has only one
 cow, which was a gift from your government.

 CAPITALISM, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. You sell
 one, buy a bull, and build a herd of cows.

 BUREAUCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. The
 government takes them both, shoots one, milks the other,
 pays you for the milk, then pours the milk down the
 drain.

 AN AMERICAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You sell
 one, and force the other to produce the milk of four
 cows. You are surprised when the cow drops dead.

 A FRENCH CORPORATION: You have two cows. You go on
 strike because you want three cows.

 A JAPANESE CORPORATION: You have two cows. You redesign
 them so they are one-tenth the size of an ordinary cow
 and produce twenty times the milk.

 A GERMAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You re-engineer
 them so they live for 100 years, eat once a month, and
 milk themselves.

 AN ITALIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows, but you don't
 know where they are. You break for lunch.

 A RUSSIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You count them
 and learn you have five cows. You count them again and
 learn you have 42 cows. You count them again and learn
 you have 12 cows. You stop counting cows and open
 another bottle of vodka.

 A MEXICAN CORPORATION: You think you have two cows, but
 you don't know what a cow looks like. You take a nap.

 A SWISS CORPORATION: You have 5000 cows, none of which
 belongs to you. You charge for storing them for others.

 A BRAZILIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You enter
 into a partnership with an American corporation. Soon
 you have 1000 cows and the American corporation declares
 bankruptcy.

 AN INDIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You worship
 them.

Given the recent developments related to the DPC project, I would like to
offer the help of my group in providing analytical support in evaluating different options
that are open to us.

One member of my group, Sandeep Kohli, worked for years for DPC
in Mumbai and has not only good understanding of all the related contracts,
but also excellent relationships with the major stakeholders, partners and regulatory authorities.
He has also excellent analytical skills. His recent project was related to evaluation
of the potential for developing power markets around Maharashtra, to improve
economic viability of the DPC project (Dec 2000 - February 2001) - a presentation
is attached.

Please, feel free to ask <NAME/> Hughes about Sandeep's skills and dedication to the company.

Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating.  Your insurance and repair numbers seem very low.

While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max. rates.
For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E.  (approx $18 mil revenues to Cal.  + $5.6 revenue on San <NAME/> - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million

Thanks for getting people together. There are (at least) 3 things going on here:

1) Coordinate PG&E/SCE
2) <NAME/> "meet and confer" (on Monday?  sez <NAME/>) to discuss the prehearing conference at the PUC on Nov. 7th.
3) <NAME/> meeting to discuss settlement of PX credit that Fielder's coordinating.

2 and 3 are, of course, extremely related.  It is critical that gov't affairs (you or me or both) be completely involved in items 2 and 3 above, and frankly, i think that one of us needs to be at the meeting.  No finger pointing, but our litigation strategy with edison thus far has been wanting.

We have a number yet for the call?

Hello,

I need one ticket to Las Vegas leaving on Friday 4/20 and returning Sunday 4/22.  I have a ticket reserved through my travel agent leaving Portland at 4:20pm and returning on Sunday at 12:30pm.  I reserved this yesterday as the spaces seemed to be filling up.  The price on this is $550 round trip.  My only need is to be back Sunday on an early flight.  I can hold this ticket for a few days.  Let me know if you can do better on the price and I will cancel the reservation.  If not let me know and I will book it.

Doing fine - still in the boat.  At what is truly the eleventh hour, I seem to be getting calls about taking the Netco operations role.  Despite my statement of disinterest, there are those who would like to have one more conversation when the purchaser is known and a real role could be discussed. 

I have met with <NAME/> several times over the last several days, but each meeting has specifically focused on information needs for E&Y relative to the estate or conference calls related to the transition services agreement with Netco.  <NAME/> seems busy with these issues.  

I am meeting with <NAME/> D. tomorrow morning at 8:00 to give her an update on an infrastructure plan.  I have <NAME/> Hall researching the details and status of the Peoples JV, Bridgeline and wholesale and retail power positions in California (he is coordinating with <NAME/> Apollo and team on the retail side).  These details will help us flesh out the right support if these are some of the first assets that will be managed to create a go-forward company.

8 State Power Contracts Seen as Bad Deals
Energy: The long-term pacts require the purchase of too much electricity at too high a price for too long, a study finds. Immediate renegotiation is urged.
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL
Times Staff Writers

September 30 2001

SACRAMENTO -- At least eight of the long-term contracts to buy electricity that California officials signed this year are so egregious that they should immediately be renegotiated, according to a new, detailed study. 

The biggest problems are so-called "take or pay" clauses that require the state to buy large quantities of expensive power even if there is no demand for it, the study said. 

The contracts will saddle Californians with high electricity rates for the next decade because the state negotiated many deals that require the purchase of too much energy at too high a price, according to the analysis, which was sponsored by a coalition of consumer, environmental and renewable energy groups. 

Between January and September, the state Department of Water Resources entered into 53 agreements to buy electricity for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities, which have been unable to buy power on their own. The longest of the contracts would last 20 years, and overall, the pacts are estimated to cost $43 billion over the next two decades. 

Power generators did not rule out the possibility of renegotiating at least some contracts, but said any move to do so would have to be requested by the state. 

"If we receive a request and it makes sense for both parties to restructure the contracts, we will consider it," said Joe Ronan, a senior vice president for San <NAME/>-based Calpine Corp. But, he said, the company has "no intention of asking for renegotiation" on its own. 

Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade association for electricity generating companies, said other members of his group might also consider renegotiation. So far, he said, "I don't see any realistic legislative or regulatory efforts to push it in that direction." 

And he said the producers would oppose any efforts to force them back to the bargaining table. "We'd take strong exception to involuntary renegotiations," he said. 

For his part, Gov. Gray <NAME/> would be open to renegotiations, said his spokesman, <NAME/> Maviglio, but only if power generators show a willingness to return to the bargaining table. 

"Would we love to get a better deal?" Maviglio said. "Of course we would, but the contracts we negotiated helped us get in the positive position we are in now, and if the generators were willing to renegotiate the contracts, we'd be the first ones at the table." 

S. <NAME/> <NAME/>, who led the contract talks last winter on behalf of the state, said critics miss the larger purpose of the agreements. When the state began negotiating contracts, California had just suffered two days of rotating blackouts. The contracts tamed the market and eliminated the blackout threat, he said. 

"Insurance is insurance, and it costs a little bit," said <NAME/>, "but it's a good thing to have." 

But <NAME/> B. <NAME/>, chief economist for JBS Energy, which conducted the three-month study, noted that at least one of the most troublesome agreements was signed in July--weeks after the market had stabilized and prices had declined. 

The study of the contracts was sponsored by the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies and was financed by a $200,000 grant from the San <NAME/>-based Energy Foundation. It was conducted by JBS, a consulting group. 

The study singled out for criticism: 

* A deal with Sempra Energy, parent company to San <NAME/> Gas & Electric, which <NAME/> called the most expensive and inflexible of all the contracts. Over the life of the pact, he calculated, Sempra would earn $1.2 billion more than the California Energy Commission estimates unregulated power should cost. 

The contract lasts until 2011. For each year, it requires the state to buy large amounts of power at fixed prices whether it's needed or not. 

* A deal to buy electricity from small Northern California power plants owned by Calpine Co. that have yet to be built. The plants will be "peakers," designed to run in short bursts when electricity supplies are tight, such as on hot summer afternoons. The state agreed to pay Calpine $90 million a year for five years simply for the right to buy 495 megawatts of electricity. 

"They get $90 million a year on plants that cost $250 million," said <NAME/>. "That's huge. You get your money out in three years. If a utility had built these power plants, they would have charged half as much." 

* A deal with Alliance-<NAME/> LLC to buy the output of two inefficient peaker power plants in San Bernardino County. The deal commits the state to pay $207 million through 2010 whether or not it uses any of the 72 megawatts of electricity. 

* An agreement to pay $150 per megawatt-hour for two years--more than twice the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour of all the contracts--for power from several aging plants that Mirant Corp. of Atlanta owns in the San <NAME/> Bay Area. 

* A contract the state signed in July to buy power from Pacificorp, a private utility based in Portland, Ore. Pacificorp agreed to sell electricity at a fixed price of $70 per megawatt-hour. That price could have looked reasonable at the height of last winter's crisis, but it was double what energy sold for when the contract was signed. 

* Contracts with two power marketing companies for electricity generated by the same Southern California plants. The difference in price shows what a poor deal the state got under one of the contracts, the study said. 

One of the marketers, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., agreed to sell from 150 to 1,000 megawatts from March 2001 to December 2011 for a straight $61 per megawatt-hour. 

But a second marketer, <NAME/> Energy Marketing & Trading Co. got a nine-year contract to sell from 35 to 600 megawatts from the same plants for $62.50 to $87 per megawatt-hour. 

"When you compare those two contracts," <NAME/> said, "you know you've got a dog here. I think <NAME/> showed up earlier, and the state was desperate." 

* An agreement with Dynegy Corp. of <NAME/> that requires the state to pay for emissions credits and upgrading of pollution control equipment on the firm's California-based plants. The contract puts no ceiling on those costs, <NAME/> said, and it is unclear how high they are likely to go. 

* A pact to buy electricity from a plant being built in Victorville by a partnership between Inland Energy of Newport Beach and Constellation Power Development of Baltimore. The state agreed to a price of $58 per megawatt-hour, but is obligated to take all of the power, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

<NAME/>, a Harvard-trained economist who has 23 years of experience with electricity and gas utility issues, said the brunt of the financial pain from the contracts will not be felt by consumers until after the next election, when the pacts significantly increase the amount of power the state buys. He said 96% of all the electricity purchased under the contracts becomes available--much of it on a take or pay basis--after next summer. 

Those large power buys will come when the state is expected to have energy surpluses because of increasing supply and a decline in demand driven by higher prices. 

"The state has agreed to buy too much power, often for too long a period, at too high a price, and much of this power is simply too dirty," said V. <NAME/> White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. "To make matters worse, almost all of these contracts are dependent on one price-volatile fuel: natural gas." 

When the state began negotiating contracts in January, electricity prices averaged $177 per megawatt-hour and sometimes spiked higher than $1,000 per megawatt-hour. By June, the average price had fallen below $100. Lately, prices hover around $30 per megawatt-hour, similar to the cost California enjoyed before prices went haywire. 

<NAME/> was particularly critical of one element of the Pacificorp contract: a clause that prevents the state from taking advantage of the plummeting price of natural gas until after 2003. The price of natural gas, the main fuel used to run power plants in California, began to jump last fall but has plummeted since spring. 

Another weakness of the contracts, <NAME/> said, is that they lock the state into further dependence on gas. For the prices California will pay under these pacts, residents could have made a greater investment in power generated by the sun, wind or other renewable sources for the same price or cheaper, he said. 

Windmills and solar panels would help buffer against natural gas price spikes, he said. Renewable sources of power also don't release air pollution and gases that contribute to global warming, he added. 

"I'm paying to buy something that really isn't the right thing to buy," <NAME/> said. 

"I don't want to pay <NAME/> $69 a megawatt-hour to generate lots of inefficient gas-fired power that I have to take that's going to increase global warming and increase pollution in the South Coast Air Basin."

Attached is the structure with my comments.  Concerning the earlier question.  It is not clear under Texas law whether the surface rights by themselves are sufficient to convery the right to use property for gas storage.

I think this looks good.  For simplicity, I would use the ethnic codes we have in datamart/sap rather than creating new ones. That makes it easier to populate.  One other field to add would be visa status.  
 
As with the other documents, I believe that the population of these documents can be done now, with just the blank for "yes" or "no" for layoff waiting for the rest of the process.  You probably will have to run these by the generalist, <NAME/> or someone in ER team, and the attorneys for the special risk factors column.

Thanks to those of you who attended the ENW all-employee meeting today.  It was great to see <NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/> upfront and center.  All of you must have done a great job in reminding, encouraging, arm-twisting or forcing your teams to attend, because the ballroom was full!  

A morning meeting means that our logistics schedulers can't attend.  So we have reserved EBN 5C2 for Friday, October 12 from 2:00 to 3:00 so that we can show the videos and walk through the slides with the schedulers.  If a few others who missed today's meeting want to join, there should be room.

Thanks for the feedback so far on staff members to participate with <NAME/> Becker on one of the follow-ups from Causey's offsite - Attracting and Retaining Good People.  If you still have someone from your staff that would like to participate, please send me their names by Tueday next week.  

Golf on Monday, November 19?  Let me know early next week if you would like for a foursome from your team (could certainly include you!) to play in the afternoon tournament at Raveneaux Country Club.  If you have some team members who have worked hard on a project or put in some unusually long hours for you, this could be a nice reward.  Did I mention that <NAME/> is in charge of this tournament?  

I will be out of the office on Monday, October 8.  <NAME/> and I will be in Dallas for Mustang Monday at SMU.  I hope that the streets will be ORANGE when I get there.

Interesting.  What right does the PG&E creditor committee have to either 1) ask PG&E whether it's begun talks--informal or otherwise--with the PUC, and/or 2) request that PG&E begin talks?  I'm assuming that there may be some chance for #1, but very little, if any, for #2.  Thanks.
Best,
<NAME/>
<NAME/> pact could point way for PG&E 
The multibillion-dollar settlement between Southern California <NAME/> and California regulators could ultimately ripple well beyond homes and businesses in the south state. 
It might form rough outlines for a deal that could pull Pacific Gas and Electric Co. out of bankruptcy without removing its assets from state regulation. 
The pact between <NAME/> and the California Public Utilities Commission also might presage a nimbler PUC, one likelier to strike closed-door deals without its typical months of testimony, briefs and hearings. 
Along with its statewide impacts, which may not fully unfold for years, the settlement with the state's second-largest utility also raises uncertainties for its customers, who will pay billions to retire its debts. 
One week after a federal judge approved the $6.35 billion pact to restore <NAME/> to financial health after wholesale power costs spiraled out of control, it is becoming increasingly clear that much of the cost will be born by south state consumers. 
From the start, the <NAME/> rescue plan was a stealth settlement. 
It was negotiated in secret, approved in a closed meeting and so murky that days afterward, even some PUC analysts were still debating just how much money was involved. 
"It's definitely ambiguously worded," said <NAME/> <NAME/>, a supervisor in the PUC's semi-independent Office of Ratepayer Advocates. On his first review of the deal, he thought about $1.7 billion would be paid by customers through future electric rates. But that figure will be at least $3.3 billion and probably higher, according to <NAME/> and those who negotiated the deal for the PUC. 
"There seems to be a lot of off-the-books interpretation in a direction that is unfavorable to ratepayers," <NAME/> said. 
The PUC settlement emerged after the Senate and Assembly deadlocked over how much money should flow to <NAME/> and what other benefits should be included for the company and some of its customers. 
In addition, the PUC gave <NAME/> permission to use small and large customers' rates to collect much of the money to pay off back debts, bypassing legislative bargaining to shield residential consumers. 
And the PUC settlement took a much broader view of <NAME/>'s finances, sweeping in old debts and cash on hand, and then basically authorized a blueprint to pay off $6.35 billion in debts. 
About three-fourths of that amount -- $4.9 billion -- appears to come from the utility's customers. 
<NAME/>'s investors will pick up $1.5 billion -- $1.2 billion through eliminating shareholder dividends for three years, and $300 million as a company contribution. 
The clearest-cut customer contribution flows into a $3.3 billion pot to be filled by future electric bills, probably through the end of 2003. But that's not their only contribution. 
Another $1.6 billion would come from <NAME/>'s cash on hand, which includes money already collected from rates and loans that will eventually be repaid by customers. 
"In the end, you're right, the vast sum of money here comes from ratepayers," said <NAME/> <NAME/>, <NAME/> vice president of external affairs. 
But if <NAME/> had won its suit, <NAME/> said, it would have been entitled to the full $6.35 billion, without its shareholders taking any hit at all. 
No one can know who would have won the <NAME/> suit. Both sides say they had compelling legal arguments. So why did the PUC, after maintaining publicly for months that it would prevail, chose to settle? 
Partly, the commission was getting gloomy forecasts from the law firm it had hired, said PUC commissioner <NAME/> Bilas. But he and others said there was another, looming fear. 
The PG&E bankruptcy reorganization plan, filed Sept. 20, called for shifting utility assets, including the company's hydroelectric plants, nuclear plant, and gas storage and pipeline network, to a firm free from state regulation. 
"People's calculus was shaken up by what PG&E did," said <NAME/> Florio, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group. "It was just in the ether that 'oh God, there's something really ugly out there. We don't think they can get away with it, but we're not entirely sure.'" 
The reorganization plan would leave a new PG&E company free to set its own rates for power that its plants produce. 
That prospect horrifies regulators and lawmakers who have watched unregulated generators set market prices so high they crippled PG&E and <NAME/>. 
They plan to fight PG&E's efforts, and one of their key tools could be showing the judge that the PUC has been able to salvage <NAME/> while keeping it regulated. 
"They could say, 'judge, you don't have to do this bad deal that PG&E wants. We can work it out,'" said Randy Chinn, an adviser to state Sen. <NAME/> Bowen, D-<NAME/> del Rey. 
For its part, PG&E maintains that the PUC should have helped it out last fall with something similar to the <NAME/> deal. But now, the utility said, it prefers its bankruptcy reorganization plan. 
PUC chief counsel <NAME/> Cohen predicts that if the utility's efforts are rejected by the bankruptcy judge, PG&E will have to begin consultations with regulators for some sort of solution. 
"I think it would be smarter to be talking now," he said. 
A PG&E rescue wouldn't follow the <NAME/> settlement exactly because PG&E's debts and costs are higher, Cohen said, but the PUC's goal would be the same goal it held for <NAME/>: a healthy, regulated utility. 
Consumer groups have blasted the settlement for funneling money to <NAME/> after the utility was allowed to essentially pad its bills during the late 1990s to position itself for deregulation. A PUC majority took a similar stance for more than a year -- until the <NAME/> settlement. 
"We finally got to the point where we said look, we've seen the alternatives, and the alternatives are something like what PG&E is trying to do, or having the state take over the business of buying power," Cohen said. 
Most people at the commission, he said, concluded that a regulated utility looks much more appealing than unregulated power plants or the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying power for cash-strapped utilities since January. 
Cohen, who orchestrated the <NAME/> settlement negotiations, said they had to be kept quiet for fear that a leak could trigger a bankruptcy filing. Bilas said if it had leaked, so many people would have tried to stop the deal that it likely would have been torpedoed. 
At a closed session before approving it, he said, every commissioner worried aloud that they were sidestepping their own frequent calls for due process, full information and proper hearings. 
It is far too early to say whether more closed door deals will follow. Bilas, Florio and others predict the current PUC has little taste for them. But the five-member commission continues to evolve each time a term expires and the governor appoints a new commissioner. 
"It scares the hell out of me what a really pro-utility commission would do with this," said Florio, the consumer advocate. "This could be the beginning of something really ugly." 
In addition, if utilities see federal suits as way to slice through time-consuming PUC procedures, a flurry of suits could follow, said <NAME/> of the Ratepayer Advocates' Office.

Thank you so much for this query.  At this time, I am not sure what happened to the numbers in our spreadsheet.  The data was pulled from AdHoc by calculating East, West, Eastbank, & Westbank.  However, the total we retrieved from AdHoc did not match the total Portcalc value.  I do not want you to spend time trying to figure out what happened to our spreadsheet because it could have been anything from using the wrong code to calc the books to simple user error.  There are too many variables that are unknown.

I was glad to hear from you and to find out your not hurt this morning.  I will make this short and to the point. I know people can read your e-mail so I trust you will know what I'm talking about if I don't write it)  I want you to know that I'm not mad at you for the decisions you have made, although I don't understand them.  You were saying one thing while thinking another and if things would have been different yesterday would you be making the same decision today?  I wanted to do things right thing this time and now it seems I won't get the chance.  Maybe things happened for the best, because if things would have different yesterday I think you would have called me with a different decision and now I know by your actions it would not have been right choice.  I don't think you have followed through but I wanted you too more than anything.  <NAME/>, I hope you are doing the right thing for YOU.  I know life comes down to a few moments and this is one of them.  I believe in "FATE" do you?

<NAME/> buys from Bank of America    250 contracts/month Jan04-Dec05 ATM + $1
 
Either set of trades takes off $60million of exposure and flattens our total nymex swap positions. The latter fits the term structure of our positions better, but the former may fit our credit positions better.

<NAME/> Accused of Infringing Electronic Trading Patent (Update2)
2001-09-21 16:39 (New York)

<NAME/> Accused of Infringing Electronic Trading Patent (Update2)

     (Adds company comment in seventh paragraph.)

     <NAME/>, Texas, Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- <NAME/> Corp., the
largest energy trader, and its online unit are accused in a
lawsuit of infringing a Texas company's patent for an electronic
trading system.

     Bid/Ask LLC of Baird, Texas, formerly called Auction Source
LLC, said it is the sole rights owner of a patent issued in May
2000 for a ``Real-time Network Exchange with Seller Specified
Exchange Parameters and Interactive Seller Participation.''

     <NAME/>-based <NAME/> and its <NAME/>Online unit are improperly
using that patented technology through its Internet-based
electronic trading facility, according to the lawsuit filed Sept.
17 in federal court in <NAME/>, Texas. <NAME/> trades commodities
such as natural gas and electricity on that trading network.

     Bid/Ask seeks a court order blocking <NAME/> from infringing
the patent, and is asking for damages.

     EnronOnline began trading electricity and natural gas in
November 1999. Between then and the second quarter of 2001, it's
handled more than 1 million transactions valued at more than $685
billion, the company has said.

     <NAME/>, which also trades space on fiber-optic networks, coal,
paper and other commodities, had net income of $979 million on
revenue of $100.8 billion in 2000.

     ``We have not reviewed the suit, so we can't comment on it,''
said <NAME/> spokesman <NAME/> Meyer.

     Shares of <NAME/> fell 9 cents to $28.30 today.

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever the risk was prior should not matter.

Hey <NAME/>,

Thanks for the response.  I think I would like to see Cinergy's bid.  I sort of have to weigh many nonfinancial issues as well.  It would be nice to know where we are at.  If you could provide me a rough number, that would be helpful.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

Can I get an instruction booklet for a model 1560 (serial 1650338)? 

Please send to:

                  Hickory Ashe Dr
Humble, TX  77346

Also, my unit keeps flashing "L" and beeping after being plugged in for only a few minutes and I can't get it to quit.  Do I need to reset the unit?  I'm assuming the "L" means Laser detected.

thanks

The note "need to verify" appears on this slide, after the bullet "110,000 MMcfd annual average increase".

I calculated this average annual amount from the first bullet "CA's natural gas use will increase from 6,400 MMcfd in 2000 to 7,500 MMcfd in 2010".  The first bullet and the third bullet are from the same source as the graph, The California Energy Commission.  Specifically, it's from their "California Natural Gas Analysis and Issues" Staff Report, dated November 2000.  The CEC's more current report from October, 2001, did not include specific long-term demand projections (it is focused on infrastructure issues).

That's the source of the numbers on this slide.

Hey all,

Can I get a copy of the settlement bullets sent to FERC staff and indicated shippers.  <NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/> & I are working on ideas on how we could revised current posting and customer point/path/segment look-up capabilities and are interested in learning whether our revised capacity procedures are any more specific than in the earlier draft we looked at.

Hi <NAME/>
 
 
You sure did.  
 
The whole thing going around here just convinces me how the basic economics and business ideas work as they should.  They all loved us for nearly four years - we could not do anything wrong and now they hate everything about us. The investors and the street is silly and stupid.  While one should spend time looking for the next Microsoft, one should spend time looking for the next <NAME/>.
 
As for the future,  I am neutral - we have a fair chance of pulling it through, though there are significant risks. If our strength is the intellectual captial - the traders and marketeres (you never hear the term franchise) - why would they hang out here for too long, the only thing holding them here is availability of capital and the tolerance of that capital to take risk.  Once the capital is gone, its hard to see the traders and deal makers stay. 
 
In the end, its  hard to say we will survive to be the biggest and baddest commodity trading house but we sure did pioneer it.

I just spoke with <NAME/> Brechtel from APS this morning.  I had called him last week asking for feedback related to our latest Sun Devil offer to them.  He reviewed our offer with <NAME/> Carlson.  <NAME/> has 2 issues (listed by priority):

1) <NAME/> credit rating and where the pipelines stand with the current financial situation.

	Do we have a timeline wherein the pipes (specifically TW) will have its own credit rating?

2) Full requirements contract settlement at FERC

	APS still has no idea where this process will lead as far as their volume requirements are concerned.  APS is still comfortable committing 100,000 MMBtu/d to Sun Devil, but likely not the 200,000 we asked for (though 100,000 with an option to increase is a possibility).

Agree.  Still not at supply/demand equilibrium.  Unfortunately, market lacks a catalyst for sharp move down from here until bid week.  i think continue to see slow erosion.  think we are slowly running out of places to put gas.  discretionary storage guys have their belly full.  can see cash/futures just keep widening from here.  q/v spread, even though it widens every day, still has a long way to go.  think you get to V and there is nowhere to put the gas.  could see v/x going to 30+.  i buy every cantango spread i can.  when market moves up the winter goes 1 for 1, when the market goes down you make money.  strongest product in the gas market are nymex futures.  everything else is a bloodbath.  socal basis has gone from $10 to $4 in the past month.  canadian storage balances are ridiculous.  imports are going to blow away last year.   new lng coming in late novy.  rig count is like open interest, a straight line up.  gas is behaving very price inelastic, just like it did on the move from $3 to $5 last year.  see little hope. 
h/j is the craziest spread on the board.  it is not a fundamentally priced spread though.  for several reasons, the industry uses that spread primarily to link the front of the board to the back.  think the front will keep drifting lower and the back will find some customer buy support as we get cal 2 down to 3.75 ish.  thus, h/j has to come in...i think.  plus i have the fundamentals on my side.

<NAME/> Gray has asked me to seek your advice concerning our <NAME/> Net Work client's request that we send a Confidentiality Agreement to an <NAME/> Net Works customer located in Australia.  Among the issues we are concerned with are whether Confidentiality Agreements are enforceable in Australian courts, should we include our standard arbitration provision and would such provision be enforceable or would we be better off getting the customer to submit to the jurisdiction of the NY courts, and lastly are there any other provisions we should be putting in the agreement.  When you have a minute we would be most appreciative of your input.  I have attached the form of Confidentiality Agreement we propose to submit to our customer.

Ask him if Scherer 1,2,3 and/or 4 would work?   Let him know that an odd lot would command a $2.50-3.00/Mwh premium on top   In addition, even if we used Scherer, it would be from any one of the facilities therefore the transmission would need to be able to use any of the Scherer units as a source.

I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid at $6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am sorry if you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these balls were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an adjustment, but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If not, I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as possible.  Thanks.

Basically, they took all the money that the core businesses made and pissed it all away in poor investments (broadband, <NAME/>, Azurix, etc...)  I just hope I have a job thru the holidays.  I feel vulnerable because I'm the new one in this group.  I would feel more secure if I was still in risk.  Oh well, I guess it's wait and see.

Patsy,

	Since I haven't heard back from you re the e-mail I sent earlier this week, I assume that you're going to pass on the Nutcracker. Although I'm disappointed, I guess it's better to know this now rather than further down the road.

	Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I really enjoyed meeting you and talking with you. You're a very, very nice person. So, I hope you find the person you're looking for. Take care and best wishes for you and your family. Happy Holidays!

*******************************************************************************
S&P Credit Indices 

                  S&P Credit Indices reflect daily movements in credit spread levels within two
                  sectors of the U.S. bond market. S&P Credit Indices are quoted in basis
                  points over the U.S. Treasury yield curve once daily. 

                  Credit spread movements within the investment grade spectrum are
                  represented in the S&P U.S. Industrial Investment Grade Credit Index while
                  movements within the speculative grade rating spectrum are captured in the
                  S&P U.S. Industrial Speculative Grade Credit Index. 

                  Each credit index represents the distribution of U.S. corporate issues across
                  different rating categories and subsectors. Re-balancing occurs regularly to
                  ensure that the indices are composed of relevant issues with sufficient
                  liquidity. Pricing information for the S&P Credit Indices' underlying securities
                  is derived from a number of sources. 

                  Option adjusted spreads (OAS) are used as a proxy for nominal credit
                  spreads in order to adjust for the presence of embedded options. Standard &
                  Poor's utilizes the proprietary option adjusted spread model developed by
                  <NAME/> Kalotay Associates, Inc.

The Utilities continue push for a "hard" deadline of DA.  They also offer an option where Suppliers would be required to submit a Affidavit for incremental DASRs and potentially have the CPUC review the specific contract language.

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  <NAME/> and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once <NAME/> is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving <NAME/>'s success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.

I tried to find the original spreadsheet that I'm sure you sent me where you calculated these quarterly rates, but I can't find it.  Do you recall these rates?

There really aren't any surcharges for San <NAME/> to Thoreau transactions.  Can you try to look at this to see why the rate might be averaging greater than max?

when you leaving for NYC?  the movie sounded VERY funny (from the riotous laughter i heard).  and those menus really do look good--maybe you could get by by giving your mom that piece of things (with your OK, of course) and that would make her feel like she's got a chunk of the event and it could leave you guys with the freedom to do all the other stuff.  just a thought.

i'm very excited but not altogether hungry.

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 
This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 
In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 
Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 
But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California <NAME/>, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 
As massive as the <NAME/> deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 
Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 
Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 
Duress alleged
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 
"We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said <NAME/> Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." 
Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 
<NAME/> Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San <NAME/>, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 
"The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 
"Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. 
Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 
Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San <NAME/> attorney <NAME/> Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray <NAME/> overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 
He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
"To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." 
The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
"First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said <NAME/> Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.
Willingness to deal
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 
The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 
Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 
For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
"In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said <NAME/> Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." 
Some experts believe <NAME/> wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 
Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
"The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said <NAME/> Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 
The San <NAME/> company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 
Sempra says contract fair
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 
San <NAME/>-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 
<NAME/> Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 
"It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. 
But V. <NAME/> White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 
White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
"There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 
"But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?" 
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 
Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 
The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 
Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 
"We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) <NAME/> <NAME/> is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said <NAME/> Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 
A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 
In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 
Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides, an authority board member. 
Said <NAME/>: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 
Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 
The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 
The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 
Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 
"I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said <NAME/> Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 
Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 
Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 
Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 
"I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said <NAME/> <NAME/>, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 
The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is <NAME/>, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of <NAME/>' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 
The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
"It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman <NAME/> Keeley, D-<NAME/>, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 
Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 
<NAME/> said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
"The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' <NAME/> said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

	4.  To the best of my knowledge all of the licenses (that you forwarded) are operating and were operating at the time of the transaction.  Do you agree, <NAME/>?

To clarify, the assets were not sold to Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  They were contributed to the formation of the LP in consideration for <NAME/>'s 40% equity stake and 50% control.  No transfer applications for these licenses has been filed.  

Also, it is not clear from the information you forwarded whether the licenses were in Louisiana Resources Company's (LRC) name or Louisiana Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership (LRP).  LRP was merged into Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  LRC is still held 100% by <NAME/> North America Corp.

Great summary.  I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones, but I have one other thought we should discuss internally.  Do we want to create a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle management to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals -- eg relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the transmission system, expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual interconnections not just applications approved), etc.  This way we could create an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and open transmission system.

Life has been pretty boring. Looks like things are going to get busy again. Going to be working for UBS Wharburg Energy. A sub of UBS AG. Should be good. Seems like at great company.

Panic-Hit City Hunts 'Ape-Like' Attacker    NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Fear gripped some suburbs of the <NAME/>n capital on Tuesday after dozens of residents reported attacks by an ape-like creature able to leap from roof to roof.  Police had received about 65 reports of a mysterious attacker with a monkey's face and human body scratching and biting victims in and around Delhi since Saturday, a senior police official told Reuters on Tuesday.  Police said they had no clues about the identity of the alleged attacker.  "Last night (Monday) alone we received 24 calls reporting such attacks," Manoj Lal, Deputy Commissioner of Police of Delhi's eastern district, told Reuters. "Of these, 19 were found to have no basis. The five others had some wounds and we are trying to confirm with doctors how they may have been caused," he said.  Television network Star News said people in neighboring Ghaziabad town -- which reported the first attack two weeks ago -- spent the night on the streets armed with sticks waiting for the attacker.  Lal said the entire eastern district police force of about 3,000 personnel had been on patrol since Monday to hunt down the creature.  The Times of <NAME/> said an industrial worker died on Sunday night in nearby Noida town when he jumped off a first-floor building after being awoken by cries the "monkey man" was attacking.  There are a number of monkeys running wild in New Delhi and on the outskirts of the city which sometimes pounce on unsuspecting pedestrians or enter houses.  Copyright 2001 Reuters News Service.

Our Credit Department has said that <NAME/> Corp. will provide a parent guaranty for ECT Investments, Inc., however, they would like for CSFB to also provide a guaranty since CSFB (Europe) is not a rated entity, or provide independent financial statements for CSFB (Europe).

At this point, I don't think any assignment to ECS solve any of these issues.  We still have to get approval for any cash outlaws from ECS since it is 100% owned by ENA.

Because of this, in years 03 and 04, our collateral posting will be significant.

Once the new database for ERMS is split for Netco. we will have to make some changes to the gas daily curve mapping tables.  Is there another way to create these mappings other than adding them one at a time.  We are getting rid of a large percentage of curves and will be making many changes to the current mappings.  Doing it one by one will be very time consuming and I want to see if you are able to load them another way.

<NAME/> and <NAME/>, unfortunately, it appears that Carrin and I will not be able to attend after all.  An <NAME/> Policy Committee (essentially, our executive committee, of which I am a member) meeting has been called for Monday, and I must attend it in person.  The flights from LA to <NAME/> on Sunday night depart too early to enable us to attend the LA event, and the earliest flight on Monday morning arrives in <NAME/> too late for me to attend the Policy Committee meeting timely.  We are extremely disappointed, as you may imagine.  We are very appreciative of your kind invitation and look forward to seeing both of you soon. We will watch the event on television in the hope that we see you being interviewed. I know you will represent us well! Let us know if your plans include a <NAME/> trip--we would welcome the opportunity to entertain you.   All the best.  <NAME/>

Gas Transportation Services                   ?
 
 
 
MOTION TO INTERVENE AND COMMENTS
OF THE ENRON INTERSTATE PIPELINES
 
 
            Pursuant to the March 21, 2001 Notice of Petition in the above-referenced proceedings and Rules 212, 212 and 214 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's ("Commission") regulations (18 C.F.R. ? 385.211, 385.212  and 385.214 ), the <NAME/> Interstate Pipelines hereby move to intervene and respond to the March 16, 2001 Petition of the American Gas Association ("AGA Petition").
 
I.
            All correspondence and communications with regard to this filing should be directed to:
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                           
II.
MOTION TO INTERVENE
The AGA Petition raises issues that are directly related to the operation of pipelines.
2.      <NAME/> operates a number of interstate pipelines subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act.  In some cases these pipelines are wholly-owned subsidiaries, in other cases <NAME/> is a part owner.  These interests are collectively referred to herein as the <NAME/> Interstate Pipelines.
The <NAME/> Interstate Pipelines have currently pending Order No. 637 compliance filings and may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding, and thus have a direct and substantial interest in this proceeding that cannot be adequately represented or protected by any other party.  Thus, the <NAME/> Interstate Pipelines' participation is in the public interest.
III.
COMMENTS
            The <NAME/> Interstate Pipelines wholly support the Response of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America filed this day and incorporate the comments made therein.
            Like INGAA, the <NAME/> Interstate Pipelines take issue with both themes of the AGA Petition.  First, the <NAME/> Interstate Pipelines take issue with the procedural request to implement the new capacity release timeline separately from Order No. 637 proceedings or GISB compliance filings.  Second, the <NAME/> Interstate Pipelines wish to once again voice concerns about the far-reaching impacts of the flowing day recall rights that the AGA petition advocates.   
            Rather than repeat those concerns again here, we have attached a copy of comments that were submitted to the GISB Executive Committee during the discussion of whether GISB should remove the current prohibition on partial day recall rights.  
            For the reasons set forth in both INGAA's response and the attached comments of the pipeline segment, the <NAME/> Interstate Pipelines ask the Commission to deny the AGA Petition.

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section 154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and 2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying time???

That faggot Lowery was in <NAME/> this past weekend.  I don't expect him to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to <NAME/> while he was

No economics or overview/summary, but I would talk to <NAME/> McKay about the basis.  In the past we have valued Leidy at CNG North in the summer and Tetco M3/Transco NNY Z6 in the winter, but <NAME/> has probably refined this by now.

I just talked to <NAME/> Lipper--works for <NAME/> Sher, but <NAME/> relies on him alot.  He's drafting the letter that <NAME/> will send to <NAME/> re: what to do about DA.

I've given <NAME/> the quotes from Angelides re: State's fiscal position will remain STRONG through JULY 2001 irrespective of whether the bonds are issued.  <NAME/> was not aware of the quotes and was anxious to get them.
I reminded <NAME/> that the only reason anyone's given to suspend DA is the urgent need to issue the bonds, but now, even the Treasurer has admitted that there is no urgency to issue the bonds.
I told <NAME/> that the letter to <NAME/> should say 1) there is no longer any need to suspend DA whatsoever, 2) the PUC should commence ratemaking proceedings immediately to ensure that there is no cost-shifting to small rez and biz customers as a result of DA and 3) the PUC should deliver to the Legislature a study recommending any enhancements, modifications, etc. that should be made to the program to ensure that DA is maintained while ensuring that granny is not harmed.

He said he would see what he could do and said that he would likely get back to us.

There is a concerted effort underway to get the PUC to reject outright at tomorrow's meeting the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC, and DWR's proposed rev. req.  The reason:  no urgency anymore.  Let's take a little time and get it right.

Best,

<NAME/>,

I can get together on Tues.  at 1:30.

I certainly want to make this report as useful as possible.  But, in some regards I feel like I failed my group in not memorializing the notes from our Omaha meeting on the specific changes that we agreed as a group to make to the report.  I have kept Dale in a state of fiddling with this report for two months now.   For example, my notes from our meeting reflect the fact that we decided against trend information.  I am certainly willing to change that decision if you guys collectively agree.

Have you considered whether we need different types of reports rather than try to accomplish all on this page.  The purpose of the current page is for gas logistics to report on what is happening on the system (i.e. how the physical world is tracking to the paper world).   We need to run through this exercise from a gas logistics side each day even if it isn't meaningful to marketing.  I'm not adverse to the concept of studying shifts in gas flows from day-day or year-year, but perhaps this is a distinct analytical tool.

Hopefully we can work out these details on Tues & then run with it.

A couple of thoughts --

1.	NG is trying to schedule a meeting in <NAME/> either Dec 4 or Dec 5.

2.	I did speak with Ashley.  He indicated that NG has no specific inclination to avoid LMP in the real-time.  He did not, however, confirm that NG was indifferent.

3.	I am very concerned with the implication that <NAME/> highlights in his point #1.  NG may simply have misstated its intentions.  But clearly this position makes it difficult for NG to join MISO under Appendix I (they would be giving up too much).

4.	I agree that what NG is really saying is a for-profit RTO with ownership of some (but not necessarily all) transmission plant in its footprint.

5.	Let's try and coordinate our discussions with <NAME/> <NAME/> in the London office to gather his thoughts on NG in the UK market.

Luiz -  Can you please develop some questions / talking points based on the attached comments that we can transmit to Ashley Brown prior to the meeting?

Thanks

<NAME/>, for your info... we just received this message from IGS re: DWR purchases.  As previously discussed seeing the DWR rfp will require some credit and contract enhancements and that process is underway but it is moving slower and with less push than I would like... For sure, there are alot of hurdles...

It is our opinion that any transactions that are being done by the DWR with third parties are relatively short dated..  1 month, 2 month etc.. but we will keep you posted as we move forward.

ENA received a letter 10/30/01 stating that Man would begin margining on a risk-weighted basis rather than using the NYMEX SPAN calculation.  This is prohibited under our futures agreement.  Man has not formally called for additional margin (which they have the right to do) but rather is withholding about $25M based upon a misunderstanding between traders about moving option positions (I'm not entirely clear about the circumstances).  Man has never claimed that the $25M was "additional margin".  ENA faxed a letter this morning to Man demanding the return of margin in excess of the SPAN calculation, basically a response to the letter.

ENA acounting does not have the software to execute SPAN calculations.  A recommendation to purchase the software was made by <NAME/> Wesner (who then reported to Joe Deffner) to accounting last year. 

I understand that <NAME/> <NAME/> intends to move most positions (including options) from Man to Paribas.  However, this information changes frequently.

Joe Deffner signed the letter and a copy was delivered to <NAME/> Kitchen.  Let me know if you need further information.

You should show "Hallwood" as the terminated party (see <NAME/>'s email below).  I don't know when the acquisition took place but we would normally hear from Global Contracts about name changes, acquisitions, etc.

What exactly do you need?  I believe the new entity is "HEP Pure" and the termination was effective 12/3/01.  You should follow up with <NAME/> Bailey or Blake Estes.

<NAME/> please review.  I don't want to misrepresent your position to <NAME/>.


<NAME/>,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my deferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen regarding the Phantom Stock Account. 

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90% of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom Stock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  <NAME/> Corp. shares in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares of <NAME/> Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,  section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan."  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distribution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for the Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states "The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of <NAME/> Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of <NAME/> Corp common stock".  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of <NAME/> Corp. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond section 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of distribution under each of the three interpretations:




Section 6.3		Plan Administrators		Section 7.1

Number of shares		6,600	shares		6,600	shares			6,600 shares
Relative share price		$27.23							$83.13
Phantom Stock Value		$179,718						$548,658
10% Penalty			-17,972			 -600				-54,866
Value to be distributed		$161,746		6,000 shares			$493,792
Current stock price									$10
Distribution			$161,746		6,000 shares			49,379 shares

I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout.  

In addition to myself, <NAME/> <NAME/>, <NAME/> <NAME/>, and <NAME/> Black are facing the same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matter.

Sincerely,


<NAME/> <NAME/>

I spoke with Bloomberg's <NAME/> Callahan.  He confirmed that all daily trades are a $15 flat fee.  On the case of a spread trade like we executed yesterday the $15 flat fee still applys.  Although a spread trade implies two trades, only $15 is charged for the whole package.  Please let me know if you have any more questions.

We want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the UBS team in preparation for Monday.  <NAME/> is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR.

Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at.

<NAME/> will contact you all with the dial in number.

The meeting will be in <NAME/>'s office.

Thanks

<NAME/> --

Please examine closely the attached note from the CalPX.  In the letter they appear to want some guidance on how to allocate the refunds to buyers or they'll simply decide.  This is a quote ---

d.	Allocation of refunds to demand (buyers).  As part of these proceeding the method of allocation of refunds to buyers must be addressed.  CalPX proposes to use its share-fraction allocation method to determine how to spread the refunds among its participants if there are no specific Commission orders on how to allocate the refunds.

Please let me know the implication and if the CAISO has a similar provision in its tariff.

Guys --

I agree that we need to file at FERC.  But we need to also get in the field with a strong message supporting FERC ASAP in the Southeast.  I'd rather go down swinging.  Maybe a least find out the objections of the parties across the region (including PUCs, stakeholders, etc.).

Steph, further to our discussion, Pls review.  I took a quick look at the locations and most appear to be East based.  You might want to use an analyst to figure this out. Also, they have valued the inventories off of the Nymex only ( or so it appears) and I would have to believe that the value of these molecules is materially different than this.

You're correct, <NAME/> doesn't get too involved in these conventions.  I don't know

any of our other desks, on the financial and e-commerce sides of the business.  Probably
not a great thing.  Anyway, lets get together for a cocktail or dinner sometime within the

Mooney's are great planes and are very fast. I almost bought an MSE a few years ago, which subsequently was called the Allegro, then the Eagle. They are really well built with no incidents of inflight airframe failure ever. Drawbacks are they are quite small and there is a cloud over he comapny as it is in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy isue is around whether the supply of parts will be available going foward. They are probably being discounted which makes it a good buy. Idon't think the parts issue is a real one as someone will step in to take over the manufacturing.

Just when you thought it was safe............................

We need to start working on getting everyone together who is in Netco in time for the sale of the company.  The ideal move time would be either this week-end or the next.  The idea is that everyone (856) resides on 5 and 6 in the new building.  HR has the most up to date list of who all of the people are.  But essentially the organisation is just a smaller version of what we have today.

All commercial people on 6, non-commerical on 5.  We would need to plan for an office to be created in the room next to mine (but hold off on implementing that piece).

As the credit group is already here (in the room next to mine) - it would be really good to move them first so they do not have to move back to the old building and then back.

Thanks

Maybe I should rephrase it: What I was trying to say there was that producers are going to continue to make efforts to increase the prices in November in line with what they have announced. Whether that happens or not remains to be seen.

<NAME/>,  I have reviewed your comments and incorporated as appropriate.  Please review attached.  The following are my comments on your changes that I did not accept:

1.  The replacement of Section 3.1 and 3.2 with Section (a), (b), etc.  is confusing, but unfortunately the September 1, 2000 amendment already made this replacement.  I am  staying with that format.

2.  Since the Original Agreement was awkardly amended in September of 2000, I think the references to the "Original Agreement as amended by Amendment #2" are helpful, so l retained them.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I am OK to send this to Dow if you are.

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 employees in the <NAME/> building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of operations employees):  

		29th Floor (trading)	67 employees		EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, settlements and EIM risk 

		30th Floor (trading)	35 employees		EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various products) 

		31st Floor (trading)	52  employees		Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., settlements and DPR 										and MPR teams
		
		32nd Floor (trading)	117 employees		Gas risk, logistics (all regions), operational analysis

				 
		37th Floor			148 employees		Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global services 						
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative "newcomer" to <NAME/> Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --<NAME/>

The good news for the pulp producers continue as worldwide chemical paper-grade market pulp producer inventories declined 345,000 tonnes in September from the prior month, according to preliminary data from the Pulp and Paper Products Council in Montreal. World inventories have fallen seven consecutive months as producers reduced their stocks 9.7 percent from opening levels.
World producer stocks closed September at 3.073 million tonnes, representing 33 days of supply and a four-day reduction from August levels. Producer inventory results are 19.4 percent higher than year-ago figures, when world producers held 28 days of supply. The inventory results were by far the largest single month reduction this year. The year's prior high was in June, when producers brought down inventories by 171,000 tonnes but faced a bloated 3.528 million tonnes of stock. 
September production of 2.525 million tonnes tumbled 10.2 percent vs. year-ago results of 2.812 million tonnes. Production levels were 5.9 percent lower than the prior month. 
Global shipments improved both month-over-month and compared to the same period last year. Shipments of 2.870 million tonnes rose 2.8 percent higher than year-ago results of 2.792 million tonnes, and surged by 4.4 percent vs. August despite a slower week of activity following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
Producers operated at 84 percent of capacity in September, down 11 percent from the same time last year when producers ran at 95 percent. Meanwhile, the shipment-to-capacity ratio, considered an indicator of producer discipline, advanced another 5 points to 95 percent, PPPC reported.

From what I have heard, this looks pretty good.  But I wonder if paragraph 1(c) is correct.

Since this is my work e-mail address, I enjoyed a much overdue break from <NAME/> Wednesday through Sunday, so I did not read your e-mail message until today.  I tried to open the attachment - our network operations require that the file be saved first before opening.  Did that, and what comes up looks like it is in tongues!!!

I worked the weekends of November 10 and 17 (Sat and Sun), and have had very long hours during the week - latest one on record to date was 1:00 AM last Tuesday.  Unless <NAME/> got that article to you in another way, we are missing that from the newsletter!  

I will call you and if indeed <NAME/>'s article is not in there (not the permission form, but another article), I will contact <NAME/> and I will simply make copies of the article to be inserted in the newsletter prior to mailing.  Sorry about this!!

<NAME/>'s 2001 United Way Campaign focuses on making a difference to people severely impacted by the recent flood "<NAME/>".  All business units and Corporate functions will be participating in a Day of Caring, teaming with the following United Way agencies: Jewish Community Center, YMCA, Neighborhood Centers, and Center for the Retarded.  The Corporate functions and EGAS employees' Day of Caring is on Wednesday, August 8, 2001, and we will be teaming with the Jewish Community Center to provide assistance to senior citizen meals-on-wheels beneficiaries.  Activities that will be completed that day include painting, yard work, landscaping, cleaning, and various home repairs.

The Jewish Community Center provides community services to individuals regardless of religious orientation.  These services include: childcare, youth development, summer day camp, meals-on-wheels and congregate meals to the elderly, health and recreation programs, dance, drama and music programs, refugee services and other community services.  The Jewish Community Center is responsible for providing approximately 40% of <NAME/>/<NAME/> County meals-on-wheels per day.  Funding comes from a combination of federal and state programs, the United Way and individuals.

I encourage every single employee  to take at least half of your day on August 8th to participate in this effort.  RAC's goal is 100% participation.  It is a unique opportunity to truly make a difference in someone's quality of life, and you will be able to see first hand how your United Way contributions improve the lives of people in our own community.  

Below are our United Way contacts within each group that will be helping with this process and can answer any questions.  Please sign up with your team leader by designating whether you are interested in participating for a full day, or for which half of the day, and they will review with each function's department head to ensure appropriate RAC coverage for that day's responsibilities.  

Thank you in advance for volunteering your time.  Let's show everyone that RAC is dedicated to helping those that are less fortunate.

ENW submitted our preliminary revised budget two weeks ago.  In our meeting in the Board Room, we did acknowledge that the ENW budget is very dependent upon the business plans of the business units that we support.  Since our budget meeting was the first that you conducted, we agreed that the ENW revised 2002 budget would need to be reviewed again once the business plans and associated budgets for other <NAME/> business units were completed.  Has that process been completed such that we can now re-evaluate the 2002 budget for ENW?  

I will follow up with you or someone on your staff on January 2 so that we can complete this budget process.  

I hope that you and your family enjoyed the holidays.  --<NAME/>

<NAME/> Walters: <NAME/> vs. Lynch -- or is the feud a charade to shield the governor?
When Gov. Gray <NAME/> named political operative <NAME/> Lynch to the state Public Utilities Commission -- and insisted that she become the PUC's president as well -- it was in keeping with <NAME/>' long-established mode of personally controlling major political levers. 
All of that occurred, however, before California was plunged into the "energy crisis," an infuriatingly complex amalgam of politics, economics, power supply and distribution, and such uncontrollable factors as the weather. 
When the first strains were felt 1 1/2 years ago, <NAME/> and Lynch reacted, as one might expect, in tandem and, as later experience proved, poorly. They refused, in effect, to intercede with some steps -- such as long-term, low-price supply contracts and perhaps small rate increases -- that would have prevented the situation from deteriorating into a crisis. 
Last January, when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts, <NAME/> and Lynch were forced to act. But within a couple of months, the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart, at least publicly. 
At Lynch's behest, the PUC enacted a stiff rate increase while <NAME/> claimed that she and the PUC had acted on their own, without his knowledge. It was widely seen at the time as a ploy, one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary, without forcing <NAME/> to publicly change position. 
Since then, the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways. The PUC stepped into the political stalemate over Southern California <NAME/>, for example, working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval. And the PUC has opposed the authority sought by the <NAME/> administration to finance bonds that would pay for past and future state power purchases. 
Administration officials are publicly critical of Lynch and the PUC and circulate stories that <NAME/> considers her to be an impediment. One version had <NAME/> dumping her as president of the PUC in favor of a friendlier member. And PUC officials insist that Lynch is just acting to preserve the historic independence of the agency, first created nearly a century ago as a bulwark against the out-of-control Southern Pacific railroad. 
A lengthy article in Monday's Los Angeles Times traced the history of the <NAME/>-Lynch relationship and, in effect, endorsed the conventional wisdom that the two erstwhile political allies had grown apart under the strain of the energy crisis. 
That may be true, but the intensity with which that interpretation of events is being peddled makes one suspicious that it's just another ploy aimed at protecting the governor's backside from the fallout of his less-than-deft handling of the energy situation. Polls indicate that it's the primary reason why his public approval rating has dropped dramatically this year, thus making his re-election next year less than certain. 
By doing the deal on <NAME/> -- supposedly without <NAME/>' knowledge -- Lynch saved the governor from a huge embarrassment. He had gone to the mat for the utility but was rebuffed by a Legislature dominated by his own party. He had called a special legislative session on <NAME/> but had been told that he would lose again. 
Holding up approval of the administration's bond-power contract scheme is often cited as the most powerful evidence of a schism between <NAME/> and Lynch, but she may be doing the governor a big favor in that arena as well. The contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and, if implemented, will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade. <NAME/> needs to dump them, but if he acts directly, he'll have to admit that he made a mistake. If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority, he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices, or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging. 
Maybe <NAME/> and Lynch are feuding, but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor.

Hadn't talked with you in a while and thought that I would send a quick note to say hello.  Saying it is busy here sounds a bit like a broken record, but it is busy here!  Big challege currently is juggling our huge day-to-day business for <NAME/> Americas, starting the absorption of some pieces of EES (my part alone looks like an additional 120 employees, with the intent to find ways to assimilate that business and ultimately reduce overall support costs for <NAME/>), the sale of <NAME/> Pipeline to AEP that should conclude in June or July and the commercialization of mid and back office services.

The 2002 <NAME/> Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  <NAME/> Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through <NAME/> Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

<NAME/> Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, "in progress" or "planned" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

Greetings Severin:

No, I'm not writing inquiring about employment as a research analyst (despite <NAME/>'s woes, which I'm sure you've been reading about).  

However, my fiancee, Prentice Sellers, who got her MBA from Haas last May, is actively looking for work at an interesting place.  I wanted to let you know that she has applied for a position at the consulting firm that you're affiliated with.  

Forgive the less-than-objective plug, but she's extremely bright and talented and did very well at Haas. Prior to attending Haas, she worked at LECG, where she was highly praised for her work and consistently got rave reviews.

She'd be a valuable asset to the firm and is worth giving a serious look.

Thanks for reading this paid advertisment.

Please be aware that there is a scheduled power outage in ECS this weekend on Saturday, January 19, 2002. The outage is scheduled from 2:00pm - 4:00 pm. 

There should be no impact with the exception of a loss of power to the plasma screens.

 In order to protect the plasma screens from becoming damaged during the power shutdown, technical support will need your assistance in turning off all plasmas in your area this Friday at close of business. Desktop Support technicians will assist with turning back on the plasmas on Tuesday morning, January 22, 2002 starting at 6:00 am (as Monday is a holiday).

I am sending this to the admins in ECS. Please forward to anyone I may have missed and please assist us in spreading the word to anyone who may be working on Saturday. Again, the only impact will be the loss of the plasma screens.

<NAME/>/Lizzette -- 

I would say that the background check issue is a business call.  They are the ones who require the background checks and the type of background checks.

Same with the guarantee language.  If there is a change, however, I would make it to the SSD instead of the main agreement.  That way, we won't have to live with it for every placement.

I'll check on reviving the unbundling, but I think they've begged off of that for now.  In their most recent BCAP, they do propose to implement a customer-only open season on their backbone.  You have that proposal?  And having SoCal buy for SDG&E seems somewhat likely.  I can check on that.

just calling to see if you have anything ingenious to say about this market.  i've covered most of the shorts starting 3.40 all the way down.  agree market probably not at equilibrium just dont really want to press it right now.  the easy money's been made.  want to have a few bullets just in case hot weather or storm takes this thing up to $3.50.  selling some upside calls just in case that never happens i'll still make money.  been an incredible run so far.  have half a mind to pack things up and go on vacation for the rest of year.  however, i'm just doing it for a week and a half starting tomorrow.  will talk to you when i get back and we'll figure out what to do then.

<NAME/> & <NAME/>,

Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs.  Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.  

I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.

We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San <NAME/>, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San <NAME/>.  

I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.

We would prefer (given the schedules) to hold a conference call on Wednesday pm with a group of marketers/generators.  Seems like the easiest way to discuss with everyone.  It would be great to have a paper from NG earlier in the week.

<NAME/>,

How's this for starters...

 

The San <NAME/> plant receipts and Rockies production information should be accurate.  The third tab, Keystone Receipts, is definitely not comprehensive.  That information is for El Paso Natural Gas only, and only the first section of the table has the receipt points values.  Unfortunately, a lot of production in Keystone moves onto intrastate pipelines that we do not have data for.  I'll see if I can get together at least some TW and Northern numbers for the Perm and that might be as good as we can get.

Just talked to the PUC.  Seems that EES is up-to-date on its registration and it's only EEMC that's not current.  <NAME/> will get the 1K to <NAME/> <NAME/>, who's filled out the requisite one-pager and will send check and paperwork to where it needs to get.

HOWEVER, the PUC person notified us that they previously received notice from the issuer of EEMC's security bond that EEMC's security has been canceled.  She said that we have until day-after-Xmas to get current on the bond.  She could not reveal who the issuer is and I don't have that info. Presumably someone in EES received notice that the issuer was canceling EEMC's security bond?  We need to get info on that.

We should therefore also double check that the the issuer of the EES security bond hasn't also canceled.

Let me know if you have any questions,  and let me know what we find out about the bond, or if there's anything I can do to assist.

Our curve validation process is one of the key items that <NAME/> Andersen will be reviewing at year end.  AA has looked for us to strengthen this process, and <NAME/> Bauer stated about 6 weeks ago that he would be looking closely at this.  (His focus may now have been diverted, but I would also anticipate that AA's reviews will have a new intensity about them!)  

In preparation for this, I have called a meeting today with the risk leads across all commodities.  I want to hear from them in a protected environment today what they are and are not doing regarding curve validation.  We will review the recent changes recommended regarding curve validation (from the task force lead by Shona <NAME/>) and discuss specific action steps to insure that we demonstrate an improved curve validation process.  I have a meeting with Shawn Kilcrest and <NAME/> Bauer later this week and, following today's meeting, I hope to give them assurances about progress that has or will be made.  

You are welcome to join us in this meeting.  If you do not attend, please get with your respective risk leads later today or tomorrow so that you are aware of the current status of curve validation in your area and any improvements that may need to be made quickly.  

The meeting will be held as follows:  	3:00 - 3:30 PM

Hello,
 
The November FOEX that came out today showed a small up-tick versus last week. 

FOEX for NBSK was US$465.43 up US$0.95 (0.2%)

FOEX for BHKP was Euro 466.02 up only Euro 0.02. In terms of dollars BHKP was US$420.55 up US$4.46 (1.07%).

Even though the movement upwards is very minimal, it is still in line with the pulp producers' attempts to raise prices. The price increases so far have been partially successful as producers have only been able to push for a US$10-15 dollar increase  instead of US$20-30 as previously announced. Still price increases are expected to continue in November. 

Please see attached for a chart on FOEX indeces.

     Just one suggestion. I think it's still unclear as to why we needed to file CH.11.

The call was pretty tough. 
Quick side bar:  <NAME/> is very concerned about TURN getting a stay from the court on the EIX/PUC settlement .
At the start of the call, Fielder said that he'd fax me the judge's ruling in the TURN appeal, but based on how the call went, I'm not sure if he'll send it. 
As we conjectured sometime back, <NAME/> is indeed talking about charging us (through a reduced PX credit) for our "share" of the undercollection.
Our "share" would be paid down through a reduction in the PX credit over the life of the settlement (presumably about 2-3 years).
In short, with one hand <NAME/> would pay us what they owe us; with the other hand, <NAME/> would take it back.
<NAME/> intends (as we conjectured) to base the amount of the undercollection owed by DA customers on the percentage of load they represent (e.g., if DA is (was) 10% of the load, they would pay for 10% of the undercollection).
We had a very "animated" discussion that went back and forth for some time.  
I told him that there's been some gross misunderstanding since his proposal simply doesn't track.
Fielder said that they believe their argument is solid.
Here's how we left it--he's going to get back to us by COB today or tomorrow and tell us what <NAME/>'s calculation is of our "share" of the undercollection.
We can discuss further on the call that <NAME/>'s setting up for tomorrow.

If you have any questions between now and then, 	give a holler.

Hellllooooo,

How are you doing?  I know I have been delinquent in sending you a note but there has been a lot going on these days.  The move still is not quit complete, I still have things I need to do up there and I probably need to do a weekend trip to get everything cleaned up.  I ended up selling you curio (sp?) cabinets and keeping you TV. cabinet.  Hence I have a cheque for you that needs to be sent, or picked up if you like?

The move has gone pretty well all things considered.  We managed to fit two 2000 square foot homes into one 900 square foot apartment.  It kind of has the cluttered eclectic New York apparent look to it.........you know the same as your basement in Summerland.  Nothing major got damaged, in the move so that helps.  I still have to switch over my car registration and insurance, and we all know how much fun that is so I've been procrastinating.

I've done a couple of fun things since being down here.  I've gone to two college football games, one at College Station to watch Texas A&M beat Notre Dame, and one in <NAME/> to watch the University of Texas beat Colorado.  They were both day trips about two and a half hours from <NAME/>, so the drives were not that bad.  Its just kind of neat to be in a Stadium with 90,000 other fans.  It is truly amazing to hear the noise that can be made by that many people.  Two weekends ago I watched the Texaco Grand Prix of <NAME/>.  This is a car race similar to the ones they have in Vancouver and Toronto each year.  There are two Canadian drivers in this racing series but both of them had a bad day.  One of them crashed and the other finished way back.  The highlight was that <NAME/> had sponsored a car just for that race that was doing very well up until the second from last lap when it crashed.  Oh well, at least it was fun to have some one to cheer for, and it was a pretty nice day to sit out side and drink a beer.

Work is hard and not going as well as I hoped, but I think I just need to give it some time.  <NAME/> also has been in the news a lot these days for all the wrong reasons.  It sounds like one of the "way high-ups" had a questionable kick back deal with <NAME/> that has come under attack.  The Board of Directors has been sued by shareholders and all the regulatory people are starting to ask questions now.  It looks like my plan for early retirement is out the window as our stock price this year has fallen from a high of $90 to $25.  So much for getting stock options as your bonus.

Anyway, the World Trade attacks have not really changed much down here.  There seems to be more hype than anything else, you know anything the media can latch its teeth into rip apart.  I'm actually getting tired of all the rumors and fear mongering that is going on.  I figure if my time is up, than so be it, but I'm not going to spend all day worrying about it, its a waste of energy.

I hope the new job goes well.  I'm glad to hear that your back working, I was starting to worry about you a little.  You know what can happen when people lock themselves in their house and don't get out enough they tend to stop going out all together.

Anyway, its time for me to start working so I have to go now.  Take care and have fun at your new job!

Love

<NAME/>

is tentatively scheduled to take place on February 21 - 22, 2002. Depending on your calendar, the
conference organizers can reserve a time slot for your presentation at the conference dinner
(February 21, 2002, Thursday) or lunch (February 22, 2002, Friday).

This annual conference is devoted to financial engineering in the energy business. The topics covered
in the past meetings  included applications of real options technology to the energy business, risk management
and the future of deregulation. The agenda of the last conference is attached for your review; the agenda
for the 2002 event is under development.


Given <NAME/>'s relationship with UT and our interest in the Energy Finance program, 
a great source of highly skilled talent for our Analyst / Associate Program, we think that your participation
will benefit the company. The conference is widely attended by senior executives of other
energy companies and is an excellent forum to present <NAME/>'s accomplishments and the 
agenda for the future.

FYI, 
I spoke with the erms team about the problem we have with curveview going through runm.  If you open runm on your PC instead of a sun machine, you need to open curveview first.  If open curveview before any other applications, the screen will be blue and all others will be set up correctly as well.  According the Erms guys this is an ancient program and they are unable to fix the logic.  Pass this on to your groups.

Can you hold on this until after mid-week this week?  We haven't gotten much communication from "above" on spending, but everyone is doing the obvious things to be prudent right now.  I can tell you that even over this Thanksgiving weekend (with banks open on Friday), that there is still tremendous concern and focus on cash.  (I got calls at home on Friday afternoon to provide data on EA, EGM and EIM payables - data deemed critical that day).  I know that company-wide, we will want to be certain that the cancellation of the company-wide holiday party does not result in just as much money being spent by hundreds of groups across the company.  

If  waiting until after mid-week makes the timing diffcult for planning purposes, I might suggest a less costly version.  One idea is to tell your directs that you want to bring them together as a group to thank them for their hard work and offer your home for the occassion on the 7th.  You could submit for expense reimbursement the cost of something like wine and beer, and ask everyone to bring a snack to contribute to the party.  I think that everyone would understand not having the entire event underwritten by <NAME/> - especially following the events that will occur  this week.  Over the years we have all gotten used to <NAME/> footing the bill for so many things.  At the bank where I was before, we occassionally had get-togethers where we all brought something to the party.  It is not really unusual outside <NAME/>.  --<NAME/>

In a word - no.  ENW budgets have already been submitted to Corp as well.  There are allocations from ENW to Corp for IT Infrastructure (primarily headcount driven) and IT Maintenance and Development, and I will be reviewing these with <NAME/> Causey.  The largest portion of our ENW costs are allocated to EA, EGM, EIM, and EES.  It is these business units primarily with whom we are meeting to share the level of detail discussed in my memo.   These business units already have in hand an allocation billing for 2002 from ENW.  Our meetings at a greater level of detail may result in some changes to the ENW budget, as business units understand more detail around the cost structures for supporting certain lines of business and certain IT development costs.  When I explained our budgeting process to <NAME/> Causey, he had suggested that I share that with everyone on the Management Committee.  Some members are more directly impacted the the ENW budget than others.  --<NAME/>

As I said, take it up with EBay or the individual you outbid.  I see your max bid says $1600, an obvious mistake that you had to approve unless EBay made a mistake.  For the last time $61 is obviously not out of the price range for those balls this weekend, you won by a dollar.  You can cancel your bid before the auction ends and you did not.  Per the attachment I sent, you have another 5 days to decide to pay or get Ebay to adjust it or I will seek payment through them.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to <NAME/>	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to <NAME/> Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								<NAME/> Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the <NAME/> South building.
	I have asked <NAME/> Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). <NAME/> Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both <NAME/> and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to <NAME/> Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking <NAME/> Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

I would suggest you take it up with EBay.  See my attachment regarding EBay's policy on Non Paying Bidder.  I have tried to contact the person that you outbid - the person that bid $60.  He has not responded.  I would suggest you try and contact him to have him pay for the item at his highest bid.  I have bid on items before on EBay and it clearly asks you twice to confirm your bidding amount.  I would be more than willing to change your payment if the price got way out of wack.  $61 is actually cheaper than some of the balls were going for this weekend.  I hope the person that bid $60 will respond and "get you off the hook".  Otherwise, EBay will have to intervene on your behalf.  I guess it is possible, their system messed up, but it looks like you approved a bad bid.  Sorry.  Good luck.

Non-Paying-Bidder / Final Value Fee Credit Request Program  This is your place to learn about eBay's Non-Paying Bidder Program and supporting features. Start here if you're a: * Seller who has a non-paying bidder and would like a Final Value Fee credit for your unsold item. * eBay user who is interested in knowing more about what happens when high bidders don't pay.  Non-Paying bidders face the following consequences through this program: * First offense: warning * Second offense: warning * Third offense: Indefinite Suspension <http://pages.ebay.com/help/basics/g-indefinitesuspension.html> What to do if you're a seller with a non-paying bidder 			
Step	Explanation	Time Frame	
1. Contact each other <http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?UserInformationRequest>	Contact each other after your listing has ended. Like you, buyers can have emergencies or computer problems. Your high bidder may not be able to respond to you right away for legitimate reasons. 	Generally within 3 business days is a good idea.	
2. Payment Reminder <http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?myebayportal>.	Send a payment reminder email to your winning bidder. You can customize the email.	After 3 days but not past 30 days of your listing's close.	
3. Non-Paying Bidder Alert. <http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?NPBComplaintForm>	File a Non-Paying Bidder Alert if you still don't get a response or if you feel you may not receive payment. Remember: In order to collect your Final Value Fee credit, you must complete a Non-Paying Bidder Alert Form on time. eBay then will send an email to you and your high bidder.

Thanks for the advice.  Much appreciated.  We plan on test driving
this weekend.  The BMW has a racing track in the back of the dealership -
I heard it's pretty sweet.  I have a feeling we're going to lean toward
the 330i just b/c everything I've read rates it the best in its class.
I feel like the 5 series will be too big for us right now (w/o kids) but
we should get a better feel this weekend.  I'll keep you informed.

*********************************************************************
Fallout in California
 


PG&E remains in bankruptcy 

The company's proposed plan of reorganization places the bulk of its gas and electric assets under FERC jurisdiction, leaving distribution under control of the California PUC


The California PUC and <NAME/> reached agreement designed to keep <NAME/> out of bankruptcy

On the heels of a failed legislative effort to return <NAME/> to solvency, the California PUC has agreed to a rate plan to permit <NAME/> to pay its creditors


The <NAME/> administration still can't agree on a plan to use utility rates to reimburse the State's General Fund and pay for long-term power contracts

California used about $12.5 billion of taxpayer dollars to buy power on behalf of the state's cash-strapped utilities and signed more than $45 billion in long-term contracts

Unless California devises a plan to finance its foray into the energy business, California could turn its energy crisis into a fiscal crisis


California suspends the only successful piece of its failed restructuring scheme--customer choice

Fearful that customers will find better prices for power than it can provide, the State decided to temporarily suspend Direct Access in California and force customers to remain with the utility

The suspension is very controversial, prompting market participants to threaten litigation in the attempt to get Direct Access reinstated in California

Is there an alternative quote we could use instead of the reference to "stabilizing" in the California market?

Perhaps we could reference the continued availability of direct access or renewed interest in <NAME/>'s offerings?

I know that the long term solution rests with <NAME/> Thompson.  But, <NAME/>, I'm frankly shocked at GMS seeming lack of concern for the seriousness of this situation.  I have serious leadership questions about a group that could continue to receive charts in after the 5th of the month (on ALL 16 charts!) and continue to just file these reports without ever even looking at them or making corrections.  When ask why they never raised the issue or brought it to management's attention, their response is that this is the way we've done things for 20 years.  

I'd like to visit with you about the leadership and direction of the GMS group.  No problem with measurement data is ever GMS responsibility -- its always someone elses fault -- the field didn't get the info in in time, the OMV wasn't received, the system doesn't work....What is the level of service that GMS is accountable for.  Please understand that this criticism is not directed to you.  I'd just like a chance to brainstorm with you one on one about how we ever have this group enter the 21st century with the rest of us -- befort <NAME/> Neubauer raises his frustrations to the highest levels of ETS.

<NAME/>,

Per our conversation, I have outlined <NAME/>'s task for the team....

Background:  Portland maintains in their database a table called "PlantOutage".  Records in that table each contain an outage "BeginOutageDate", "EndOutageDate", "CapacityOut" and "OutageReason".  Records also include a PlantID (key field for PlantCharacteristics table) and a PlantUnitID (key field for Unitcharacteristics table).  The PlantCharacteristics table contains a "WSCCRegion" field and the Unitcharacteristics table contains a "Fuel_Designation" field.  

Portland has a stored procedure that for a specified date range can calculate for each date the sum of "CapacityOut" for all outage records where the date falls between the "BeginOutageDate" and the "EndOutageDate".  I have inlcuded the results of this storaged procedure in the attached file.  Our task is similar but requires more detailed subgrouping of the data.

Objective:  The objective is to return the Sum of "CapacityOut" by each possible subgrouping for each day in a range (say 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2001).  There are roughly five possible parameters for "Fuel_Designation", seven for "WSCCRegion", and two for "OutageReason".  The resulting query would return approximately 70 values for each day within the specified range.

Format:  Ultimately we will have the date in one excel sheet with dates down the left and each of the 70 sub groupings across the top.  It would be most convenient if the results of the query were formatted in this way.  Alternatively, we can use a pivot table if the results of a list query are provided.  If the second option is used, we will need to get the data in two separate lists since excel can only hand 65,000+ rows.  In this case, we would use the "OutageReason" grouping (which only has two parameters) to split out the two lists.  


Thanks for your help.

How to Explain <NAME/> to Your Children:

Feudalism - You have two cows. Your lord takes some of
the milk.

Fascism - You have two cows. The government takes
both, hires you to
take care of them, and sells you the milk.

Communism - You have two cows. Your neighbors help
take care of them and
you share the milk.

Totalitarianism - You have two cows. The government
takes them both and
denies they ever existed and drafts you into the army.
 Milk is banned.

 Capitalism - You have two cows. You sell one and buy
a bull. Your herd
multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell the milk
and retire on the
income.

 <NAME/> - You have two cows. You sell three of them to
your
publicly-listed company, using letters of credit
opened by your
brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity
swap with an
associated general offer so that you get all four cows
back, with a tax
exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six
cows are transferred
via an intermediary to a Cayman Islands partnership
secretly owned by
the CFO of the publicly listed company who sells the
rights to all seven
cows back to your listed company. The annual report
says the company
owns eight cows, with an option on one more, and that
these and certain
other cow-related activities give milk, both realized
and
unrealized/notional, at an annual run rate of 1.54
billion gallons

Wisconsin's offer is a joke.   
 
<NAME/> - This is is clearly a two-way termination or they would have no offer at all (I'm assuming you understand the difference).   We can buy Cal-02 Com-<NAME/> under $30/Mwh all day long.

Hey <NAME/> and <NAME/> -- 
 
I wanted to get in touch with both of you -- I FINALLY got your email addresses.  My little girl - Erin - is almost 4 months old now - and is and absolute joy.  She's a pro a rolling over and grabbing and chewing on everything she can get her hands on.  I wish you guys could see her.  I'm attaching a picture even though it's a little old.

 
After you see this  - I won't have to tell you how much she looks like her daddy.  Life has definitely changed, but for the better.  Believe it or not, I haven't gotten drunk in over a year and have no desire to do so - HA!!  I'm still working at <NAME/>, trading away -- it's still been the best move I ever made.  <NAME/> is now at Waste Management after getting laid off from the little .com company.  Again, a very good turn of events.  We are loving <NAME/>, especially with the swimming pool built in the back yard and some really great neighbors.  
 
Enough about me -- please write back with updates - I feel like I've totally lost touch and I don't want to keep it that way.
 
 
Take Care and talk to you soon,

<NAME/>,

Thanks for your message. I treat the Monday 
meeting as the opportunity to introduce <NAME/> to Prediction
Company and to inform you about <NAME/>'s trading operation
and especially about our electronic trading platforms.
The exchange of information will hopefully lead to future 
collaboration. We are especially interested in working with
you on improving the algorithms that support our electronic market
making functions (automatic adjustments of the price levels and/or bid-offer
spreads to the changing market conditions). My group has currently
a research project under way to explore the possibility of taking advantage
of some recent developments in the market microstructure theory in our operations.

I think that we can definitely collaborate in the energy and other commodity markets
and we can explore other possibilities as well. Given the exploratory character
of the first meeting, it probably makes sense if Prediction Company 
participation is limited to you and <NAME/>. We shall, of course, be glad to meet
with other associates that you may decide to bring to <NAME/> with you. We shall be also
glad to visit your company if we both decide to continue our discussions after the first meeting.

<NAME/> side will be represented by <NAME/> Whalley,  President & COO of <NAME/> Wholesale Services,
and myself. We expect <NAME/> Lavorato, a member of EWS senior executive team, and
my colleague from London, Dr. <NAME/> Leppard, to join us. <NAME/> is forwarding the agenda and some
additional information to you tonight.

You can reach me over the weekend at my E-mail addres: vkaminski@aol.com or call me at home

Alternative SDG&E debt plan to get hearings 
Approval of the governor's plan for paying the $747 million debt SDG&E says it is owed by its customers appeared less certain yesterday, as the president of the state utilities commission said she planned to hold public hearings for an alternative proposal. 
<NAME/> Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said in a local radio interview that regulators will hold hearings in San <NAME/> regarding a plan from consumer groups that purports to save customers about $185 million more than the governor's proposal. 
The groups said the earlier plan negotiated between the governor and the utility would be costly for consumers and a windfall for San <NAME/> Gas & Electric. 
At stake is how much SDG&E contributes and how much customers pay toward the debt, which accumulated in a so-called balancing account when SDG&E paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers during the power crisis. 
Despite the plan for hearings, Lynch told KPBS-FM radio that the commission would make a final decision about how to resolve the controversial $747 million debt by November. 
The governor and SDG&E announced their plan in June, saying it required the utility to contribute $319 million toward the debt and eliminated the balancing account without lengthy litigation or raising rates. 
Consumer groups, led by the San <NAME/>-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, say the governor's plan does not go far enough, particularly because SDG&E earned an estimated $400 million in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis. 
Under the governor's plan, those profits are awarded to the company's shareholders, though SDG&E would use $219 million from the profits as part of its $319 million contribution toward the debt. 
Under the consumer groups' plan, SDG&E would be allowed to keep some of the profits, but it would contribute $72 million more than it would under the governor's plan. The alternative plan also would require the utility to make other monetary concessions. 
In a formal decision earlier this year, the California utilities commission said SDG&E's profits do belong to customers. SDG&E has sued to overturn the decision in court, but it has put the litigation on hold pending the utilities commission's resolution of the plan to pay the debt. 
<NAME/> Shames, executive director of UCAN, said yesterday that he was encouraged by Lynch's call for hearings on the consumer plan. 
"There is $400 million at stake here," Shames said. 
SDG&E said yesterday that it had not received formal notification about the hearings, nor had it yet seen the alternative plan for paying the debt. 
A spokesman for the utility, however, repeated earlier comments that the company saw the alternative plan as an attempt to derail the PUC's process of considering the governor's plan. 
Lynch also said yesterday that the utilities commission would continue to challenge the more than $40 billion in long-term electricity contracts signed by the state during the crisis. 
Lynch said the agreements bind the state to overpriced power and are in violation of federal law requiring electricity rates to be "just and reasonable." 
The utilities commission president said the contracts may be even more expensive than earlier thought because at least some of the power they bind California to purchase is not needed. The extra costs would damage businesses and family budgets, she said. 
"If you have to pay three to four times more for energy, you don't have the money to grow your business or meet other needs of your family," Lynch said. 
She also defended action by the commission last week that effectively delayed the sale of $12.5 billion in state bonds needed to pay power costs. Lynch said the commission supported a legislative proposal for floating the bonds, which would separate them Sfrom the long-term power contracts.

I would like to set up a spreadsheet to enter each deal that I transact, internal and external.  I would then like columns set up that allow <NAME/> to enter post ids for all hedge strips for prior day and new day.  We should then sum the net change of the two and balance against the columns summing the new deals that I enter each day. 
 
This method should give us another way of checking if all new deals are being booked properly.  Please meet with <NAME/> Holst to discuss how to set up the sheet.  He has a similar process of checkking new deals.  Once this is set up, please have each bookrunner adopt the same prcatice with their trader.  
 
I would like <NAME/> to be responsible for seeing that this new process is in place for next week's business.
 
I understand that the standard for most deals is 5000/d and that this can lead to booking 50000/d at this volume.  We need to have <NAME/> set up a trader deal sheet that lists the volume and price in a clear and legible format for all bookrunners.

<NAME/> was excited about his new rifle. So, he went bear hunting. He
spotted a small brown bear and shot
it. There was then a tap on his shoulder, and he turned around to see a
big black bear. The black bear
said: "You've got two choices. I either maul you to death or we have
rough sex."
<NAME/> decided to bend over. Even though he felt sore for two weeks,
<NAME/> soon recovered and
vowed revenge. He headed out on another trip where he found the black
bear and shot it.
There was another tap on his shoulder. This time a huge grizzly bear

The grizzly said: "That was a huge mistake, <NAME/>. You've got two

better to
comply. Although he survived, it would take several months before
Frankfinally recovered.
Outraged he headed back to the woods, managed totrack down the grizzly

By <NAME/> Leopold

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipulating its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state under contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The state's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has proven embarrassing for Gov. Gray <NAME/>, who signed $43 billion in deals to head off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market, according to a letter sent by <NAME/> Wolfman, lead FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resources - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend the meeting.

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedures of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine months, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market structure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to develop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and procedures."

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines which power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from.

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an audit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated the market, Wolfman's office said.

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational audit of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated."

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest power first.

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR power at high prices and protect Gov. <NAME/> from political embarrassment," the second letter says.

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and declined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's meeting.

Generators Confused

That's because, according to the allegations, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-of-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market participants see.

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DWR operations chief <NAME/> Garris has said, but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-term contracts.

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to the ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hours was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computerized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than the out-of-market prices for months.

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Calif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meeting isn't open to the public.

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to improve the market.

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility practices," Wolfman said in the letter.

Alex,

Thanks a lot. I could open our resume.
We hire part-time employees to help
us with our weather effort: the work is
concentrated in the early morning hours
6:00 to 10:00 a.m.

I shall check with <NAME/> Roberts who runs the group
about our needs.

Please, let me know if you are interested in
a summer internship in 2002. The decisions
are made in late January and February and 
you should let me know by then.

We have set Monday, June 11 for the date of our Operations PRC that will include employees that are supporting ENA, EGM and EIM.  You mentioned that your functional PRC will be set for sometime between June 7 and June 14.  It would certainly be best from my point of view if my PRC occurs prior to your functional PRC.  While a number of PRC meetings will be held within Operations during the week of June 4 in preparation for our June 11th meeting, that will be the first date where we will cross calibrate directors, senior directors and VP's across ENA, EGM and EIM operations.  

I thought that it might be helpful to know the date of my operations PRC meeting in setting the date for your meeting.  Please let me know as soon as a date has been set for your PRC.

Kam,

Hey, there's a nymex sale of 5000 /day Dec at 2.945 that shows up as a changed deal in my P&L from last night.  The deal is a valid sale that I executed, but it does not appear to be valued correctly.  It's valued at $3,096 when nymex was marked at 2.735 so the value should have been $32,550.  I would contact Ashley directly, but I don't know her last name.  Thanks.

I have consolidated the changes in the following file:

 

Please change the trade date on all the newly created Bankruptcy Deals to the trade date of the original deal.  Also, please cross-reference in both transactions the associated deals numbers and document that the deal numbers are due to termination.

Also, check with <NAME/> Smith to make sure he has completed the Allegheny transfers (they were missed in the initial batch run) and then re-calc the 'Termination Test' portcalcs to ensure that the designated counterparties are not included in the old portfolios.  Also, check with <NAME/> or Zhiyun to ensure that they have attached the port-calc code to the Bankruptcy portfolios and then we need to make test runs on them as well.

Here is my recollection of the sequence of events. The concept of an operationally available capacity report and what it contains are already in GISB standards.  FERC then picked up on this concept, added design capacity & said that the report needs to be updated at each nomination cycle in Orders 587-L and in Order 637 transactional reporting.  GISB has since adopted standardized data formats for the transactional reporting, recently published in GISB version 1.5 standards.  While these standard formats have been adopted, and I believe that we are following these formats, they haven't yet been adopted by FERC -- so other pipelines may or may not yet be following.
 
I'll try to look at the NGPL posting over the weekend and compare to ours.  Also - I'm sending your email to <NAME/> Hess to confirm my recall of the standardization.

I think this is a good summary of where we are:

1.  QF Status:  Mirant is willing to provide a legal opinion that it meets the QF status under the PPA if it is required to close.

2.  A market report should be issued by Mirant today as to the reasons they have only been able to secure $300 million instead of $500 million in insurance.  Hopefully this will satisfy the lenders.

3.  Mirant's proposal went out today on how to protect the lenders if the SHO is extinguished.

4.  Mirant and GE have agreed to a closing checklist and fee coverage.

Things left to do:

1Finalize all documents

2.  Receive underwriter approval on the resolution of all insurance claims.

3.Agree upon mirror guarantees with <NAME/> and Mission relating to the Union Carbide guarantees.

<NAME/> Donahue informs me that CFSB feels secure that this deal will close on December 15 but not before.  The reason is that there are PPA bids that need to go out by that date.

Let's keep daily status reports coming. If I have misrepresented anything in the summary, please let me know.

Sun Devil: 
Sonoran Pipeline -  Calls to various levels of Kinder-Morgan management have elicited no response.  Sources indicate their project is still moving forward but is having "marketing issues".
ROW - A large diameter water line that serves Palo Verde runs from West Phoenix to the nuclear plant.  One thought was to use the ROW to install the gas line and reach the new generation plants in the area.   However, AZ Public Service indicated that the water line is constantly being replaced due to corrosion and repair work may interfere with any other line in the same easement.
Cost estimate - Current fully-loaded cost estimate (including interest, overheads, ROW, etc.) is $680mm based on a reduced scale project of 500,000 MMBtu/d capacity to Phoenix.  Various deal structures are being analyzed to present several pricing options to the market.  Likely minimum term will be 20 years based on the cost.
Marketing -
	<NAME/> - Met 10/25.  They have a need for 40,000 - 120,000 MMBtu/d and would likely take capacity on Sun Devil at a "competitive" rate.  Preparing rate 	offerings for their review 11/5.
	AZ Public Service -  Met 10/24.  They are very interested in the project and would commit today if they were given an economic out based on unfavorable 	outcome of El Paso / FERC full requirements proceeding.  Working to develop an MOU with out clause if they fund the early EIS work.
	Sempra - No response yet.
	Southwest Gas - Still interested in the project but unwilling to commit due to El Paso full requirements issue.  They are however interested in doing a JV to 	utilize their Phoenix lateral to enable the Sun Devil project to tie into the El Paso south system.
	Panda Energy - Meeting set in Dallas on 11/2.  Panda has the capability to be the anchor shipper for the project.

Preparing detailed supply basin study for management review.
El Paso / FERC  - waiting on response from Regulatory to review recently submitted comments.  Shippers indicate some decision likely from FERC as early as Dec 2001 or as late as March 2002.  
Copper Eagle Gas Storage - Open season for the proposed West Phoenix storage facility began 10/15 and was to close 10/24 but was extended an additional week for market participants.

I will send checks directly to the vendor for any bills pre 4/20.  I will fax you copies.  I will also try and get the payphone transferred.

Two statues in a city park, one female and one male, had faced each
other for many years. One morning, an angel appeared and told the
statues, "Since you have both brought enjoyment to many people for
years, I'm giving you your greatest wish and bringing you to life for 30
minutes. In that time you may do whatever you like." And the statues
came to life.

Smiling at each other, they ran toward a stand of trees and dove behind
a couple of bushes. The angel smiled as she listened to them giggling
and rustling in the grass. After 15 minutes, the statues emerged from
the bushes, smiling and happy. The angel was puzzled. "You still have 15
minutes. Would you like to continue?"

The male statue looked at the female and asked, "Do you want to do it
again?"
"Oh, yes!" the female statue said. "But this time YOU hold the pigeon
down and I'LL poop on its head!"

Call me on this one.  I think AECO would actually be better due to the fact that plant gate gas in Saskatchewan trades at AECO - X.  Therefore an AECO hedge may be more appropriate to match up their risk.

<NAME/> all is going well.

Thanks for the invite.  Unfortunately, we have a customer meeting at South Shore Harbor that day.  

<NAME/> you are doing well.  I haven't made it home to a football game yet this year -- although I guess that has been a blessing.

I take it you are not going to decommission my louise@enron.com as it is the one I have on all business cards and all our potential buyers are using it.

<NAME/>:

I heard about your new job and, what can I say except "Congratulations!".  I'm really excited for you.  I'm also glad you stuck it out at Entertainment Weekly because that job will look good on your resume, especially because you had the gumption to remain for a full year.  

Believe it or not, your dad is very "with it" and knows what goes on in the real world.  I think that he would probably appreciate a candid discussion with you.  The reality is that he cannot control what you decide to do with your life, he wants you to be happy and he wants to protect you from all of the bad things that can happen in life (if he had that power).  Since you have decided to tell your dad about your decision, I think you should talk to him like you always do and listen to him the same way he will listen to you.  You guys have a terrific relationship and you should keep it that way forever (you know fathers and daughters are really special).  He may or may not be happy with what he hears but he would rather hear it from you than from someone else.

I'm looking forward to seeing you (briefly).  Tell Park hi.
