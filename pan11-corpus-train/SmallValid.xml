Hi <NAME/>,


<NAME/> you please call this lady at TransCanada, Tracy in Gas Accounting at 402-505-8800.  She says we have a couple of term deals that have the incorrect TransCanada counterparty.  They are not deals in my region, so I thought it best to have you handle, as opposed to passing her around..

Keoni,
I am not concerned with the improperly posted ATC's. I am concerned that our bids to relieve congestion were awarded but that the respective dollar value for those bids was incorrect. We have had problems in the past with misentry of our congestion management bids. However, in this case, the awarded congestion management bids look correct to me, and it appears that the CAISO published price is not appropriate for the amount of mws flowed. I would like to figure this out as soon as possible so that we can fix any problems that might exist on our end.

Please give me a call when you have a chance.

Thanks,

Okay, you asked for it....

The mind I love must have wild places, a tangled orchard where dark
                                  damsons drop in the heavy grass, an overgrown little wood, the chance of a
                                  snake or two, a pool that nobody's fathomed the depth of, and paths
                                  threaded with flowers planted by the mind.
                                  - - - <NAME/> Mansfield

I absolutely love this quote.  It manages to state, significantly more eloquently than myself, my own personal mantra of the last few years...I want to be pleasantly surprised.  Which is ultimately why I don't see it within my power in the near future to settle.  Maybe years down the road when desperation has set in I'll break down and throw myself at some sub-par individual, but let's hope it never gets to that point or if it does that I'm bordering on senile and just don't know any better.  

Anyway, I'm so glad we got to spend so much time together at <NAME/>'s wedding and I love hanging out with you Mom and Becka (sp?)...they crack me up.  If there's anything I can do to assist you with this wedding, let me know...even if you just need someone to run errands with or support your ideas.  I'd love to get together sometime this week for a drink, coffee, dinner, or whatever if you have any free time.  Maybe <NAME/> would be available as well?

I do not believe we can make a single point a division in this case.  There is a definition of division on sheet no. 102B which seems to say a point must be interconnected with other points to be a division.  I know we treat single points as divisions in certain other contracts, but I believe these were set up prior to 11/2/92 and are "grandfathered". I also don't believe we are obligated - or able - to extend Sec. 11 rights to new points.  Frazier, what's your reading of this?

<NAME/>,
Would it make sense to press our EES/West Point guys to a decision?    We should express that we want to hire internally,  however,  we do have external candidates that we are considering.

The Reliant guy,  Ryan <NAME/>,   was a good interview and seems to have something positive to prove.   I believe that HR has some specific questions that they wish us to ask regarding his employment at Reliant.

Also,   EES is petitioning <NAME/> for me to let Watt's go right now.    I have indicated to Terry <NAME/> that mid July would be preferable due to our being already short staffed.

<NAME/>,
Frontera did agree to do the financial swap for tomorrow.   I am really excited about getting this product off.    I guess we need to follow up with the swap papers now.

Here are some things that we proposed to Frontera:

September 20th - I suggested selling October at $24.75.   This was a 10.72 heat rate.       I had to take off for an <NAME/> trip and <NAME/> took over for me in trying to get them to transact.
Power moved down,  but so did gas,   The heat rate was the same,  but they still didnt want to transact as power moved down to $24.75.    Power reached low of 10 heat rate for October recently - it is currently 10.2.

I suggested early this week in selling balance of the week at a 10.5  heat rate.   The dailies have been now liquidating as low as 8.9 hr.


August (late) - <NAME/> proposed selling 12.7  heat rate in September .   They didnt want to because they wanted to liquidate in the daily market.  This didnt work out.

On a daily basis,  Frontera has a problem making timely decisions.   For example,   I give them gas prices and daily prices.   They say that they would like to stay offline for the next day.   I tell them that I will bookout my option.   
They call back later and say that they would like to run.     Bids are now $2 less for my option and the prices they receive for their ramp up and onpeak schedule are horrible.

On Tuesday,   I suggested selling a $24 call option for October for  a $1.25 premium.    This would have at least brought in $23,000.   They werent interested in this idea.

I communicate my feelings on the market very early.   If they could react quicker,   I would smack the first bids that showed their faces,  including EOL.
I could have taken out 200mw's in a simultaneous trades several times over the last two weeks.


<NAME/> has some other instances that he would like to relay.   He will be sending another e-mail.


This relationship,  although not initially profitable,  has allowed us to develop other relationships that would not have otherwise been possible.   I dont really want to lose the job.   We are providing some outstanding support, in my opinion.

The thing that weakens our case is that Ercot is not providing the appropriate settlement details that would help illustrate our case on the OOM payments.
The settlements extract,  as I learned on my trip,  is key to explainnig this value.     The OOM value itself is well over $200k.

Good luck!

If you end up taking the tube you'll walk out of the tube station and take an immediate left.  Walk roughly two blocks and then take another right onto Portland Road.  There will be a pizza place right on the corner.  You'll walk all the way down Portland road until it looks like the road ends in a cul-de-sac.  The roads actually continues on the other side of a little bricked area with benches (a place called <NAME/>'s Wine Bar will be on your immediate left).  <NAME/>'s flat is in the row of flats to your right and the number is on the door (which if I remember correctly is blue).

<NAME/>, 

We need to talk about the ability of ENA to continue its the current role as agent of Tenaska IV.

1)  Since the end on November, ENA has not been able to complete gas trading transactions.  We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas.  This, of course, is due to the bankruptcy.  As a result, we are not able to sale Tenaska's excess fuel.  We did contact Brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a Gas Daily price, but they do not want it (gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while).  In December, we had to cut 10,000/day from the 7th through the 27th.  For January, we haven't had to cut yet, but I am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future.

2)  For November activity (which was settled in Dec), ENA owes Tenaska IV for the excess supply that we sold.  However, due to the bankruptcy, we could not make payments out.  ENA could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline.  <NAME/> Armstrong paid the counterparties directly.  I think that he should continue to do this for Dec and Jan.  We should not transfer any funds from Tenaska IV to ENA.

I don't know how <NAME/>'s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding.  But we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management.

Please give me a call or e-mail me.  We can get together sometime Thurs or Fri morning.

Hi <NAME/>

You will want to liquidate the June Exotic Options today (using the valuation spreadsheet- Basis Pipe Options 2001.xls) as well as update the Option P&L file to account for the June Exotic option's value you calculate.  You will actually roll-over the Options P&L tomorrow, after you finalize the 31st's P&L (the final P&L file will include any Prior Month Adjustments as well as broker fees).  

You will update the Basis Pipe Options 2001.xls when the actual published indexes come out...so that will most likely be Monday.  At that point you can send the file to <NAME/> <NAME/> in it's final version.

If you have any other questions just come by and get me and we'll go over them.

Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00 from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001 (sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would "file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.  

<NAME/>, <NAME/>, Question:  I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court.  Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC?  Should I contact TDC?


Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day
Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day
28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00

Due to the relatively weak real-time market during morning hours, we wanted to communicate a strategy for dec. bidding or buying-back generation that you've sold forward.  We want to stress that this is a relatively short-term strategy.  As the weather turns cold during the late-<NAME/> and Winter months, the morning hours actually trade at a premium on the real-time market.

Lately, HE1-10 have been very weak real-time, ranging between $25 and $40.  We have two strategies that we would like to suggest:
Group,
We have two important items regarding the services and asset management side of our business.

First,
The CAISO has been calling repeatedly regarding outages.  We will continue to call the CAISO for every outage (including when Black Hills goes down 200 kWh).  <NAME/> has worked closely with the CAISO regarding their new tariff and her information appears below.  It is very important that we do not expose ourselves to charges by not notifying the CAISO of an outage.

Second,
We will be working with the generators to execute buy-backs or supplemental dec. bids when market conditions warrant.  <NAME/> has written an email to the generators also detailed below.  <NAME/> and <NAME/> will be contacting the generators over the next few days to review this email with them.  Afterwards the Real-Time group will contact the generators and initiate one of the two strategies when profitable.  Real-Time will retain 50% of the profits over the generator's day ahead profits.  Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.

Thanks,

<NAME/>


__________________________________________________________________________

I have reviewed documents from the ISO's website regarding forced outages as they relate to the June 19 FERC order and concluded the following: 

(1) During a System Emergency, a penalty based on twice the highest price paid for energy in the hour could be assessed if the Participating Generator does not notify the ISO of the outage within the operating hour of the outage, and 

(2) During a Non-System Emergency, a generator could be assessed a penalty if it fails to report the forced outage within the operating hour. 

If you have any questions at all, I can be reached at extension 7733.  

Thanks,
<NAME/>

__________________________________________________________________________

1.  Decremental Supplemental Bids
We can submit dec. bids to the ISO at a price below your cost to generate.  Basically, we would be letting the ISO know that we're willing to reduce generation and actually buy the mw's from the ISO to cover the prescheduled quantity.  You are still paid the day-ahead price for the day-ahead quantity, but instead of generating it, you would be buying it from the ISO.  For example, if your cost to generate is $40, and you sell day-ahead for $50, you make $10/MWh.  If the ISO takes the decremental bid, and the price is $30, then you make $20/MWh.   

Advantages - A relatively large upside, the price the ISO charges could actually go negative, as large as negative $91.87.  Also, you would actually be buying from the ISO, as opposed to selling to the ISO and being subject to credit risk.

Disadvantages - Ten minute dispatch.  When we submit decremental bids, the ISO has the option to either reduce or increase output of the unit every 10 minutes.  In addition to the physical problems this might create, the settlements statement you receive might be relatively elaborate and possibly difficult to follow.

2.  Buying-Back Blocks in the Bi-Lateral Market:
This strategy calls for our real-time traders to buy blocks of energy in the bi-lateral market for below your cost to generate.  This would call for you to reduce your generation, and the energy we buy-back in the real-time market would be used to fill your prescheduled quantity.  Once again, you are still paid the day-ahead price for the day-ahead quantity, but instead of generating it, you would be buying it at the price paid to buy-back the energy.   As in the previous example, if your cost to generate is $40, and you sell day-ahead for $50, you make $10/MWh.  If we can buy-back the energy for a price of $30, then you make $20/MWh.   Additionally, if we do buy-back the energy, we will need to simultaneously submit incremental supplemental bids to the ISO to remain compliant with the FERC order.  Then, if the ISO takes the incremental bid, you can generate the power and sell for additional profit. 

Advantages - No 10 minute dispatch (unless a supplemental bid is accepted).  You would know exactly when and for how long the unit would be down or reduced.  Also, the settlements statements would be relatively easy to manage.

Disadvantage - Not as large of an up-side as decremental bidding.

At this point in time we would encourage you to start with the strategy #2, buying-back blocks of energy in the bi-lateral market.  Once you and our real-time traders get comfortable with the operations of the strategy, then we should move forward and start submitting decremental supplemental bids to the ISO.  We propose a 50/50 profit split, above your day-ahead profit, earned from either of these two strategies.

If you have any questions or comments please call myself or <NAME/> <NAME/>.

In the interest of moving things forward, it would help if you could provide the following info:

1. Hand-marked copy of the portions of the current contract which need to be changed.

2. A brief description of the new deal, especially the index language.

I know VEPCO may be preparing a first draft, but I think it would be good to get some focus ahead of time.

Group,

Two totally different issues for you.

First:  When scheduling transmission on Portland General Electric from <NAME/> Day to Malin we MUST use deal #146517, we MUST make the price zero.  We extend this deal in scheduling and change the delivery points.  We then make an annuity to ST-NW for losses.  Easy.

Second: For the third time in two weeks the behavior of the Real-Time Group after 6 PM has been brought up.  We will talk more regarding this in our meeting next week.  It is important to note that we need to remain within the bounds of professional behavior at all times.  <NAME/> has a zero tolerance policy regarding harassment (language or behavior that offends or belittles others).

Thanks for your attention.

How are you today?
The ball game last night was a disaster!
We give the "Bad News Bears" a bad name.
Example:  Runners on 1st and 2nd. I ask the third baseman what he will do if the ball comes to him.  He replies touch third base.  So the batter hits the ball down the third base line he runs up 5-10 feet from the third base picks up the ball and throws it to the pitcher.  I give up!  We lost 20 to 3

On a worse note.  Please don't say anything to anybody but <NAME/> just called and said Shannon has filled for divorce.
I hate to say this but he has created his own worse nightmare.  She has never earned a penny of the money she has become accustomed too, yet feels it should belong to her.  He has done nothing but foster this attitude.  Too bad its not legal to spank your spouse.
I will let you know what comes of things.

For all that have missed the floor meeting,   we have been downgraded to "junk" status,  ending our merger plans and crushing our stock price.
A likely scenario would have us declaring bankruptcy within a few days.     Payroll is said to be funded until the end of the month, at least.   
If bankruptcy is filed,  payroll should be covered.
Another very real option is that the trading floor could be parcelled and sold to an outside company.   There are discussion underway that deal with this possibility.

Currently,  we are not trading.    We need to continue to report to work and keep a log of Real Time prices.    Continue to update the Hourly Prices sheet for a record of prices.    We may need these prices as support for liquidated damages.

More counterparties will be defaulting and cutting schedules.     Please make note of such cuts and prepare to bill LD's.   We have prepared a cut log for this purpose.

Ranelle, <NAME/> and <NAME/>,  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this
	helps simplify our answer to your question.  

	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not
	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract
	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)

	For Nominating purposes:

	MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. 
	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.

	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.

	EXAMPLE:

	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the
	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper
	will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything over will be 
	overrun at IT rate.

	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. <NAME/>

Good morning,

Yesterday for HE 10 and HE 11 we were cut Real Time by El Paso Electric on an import (EPMI_CISO_BLUE).  The import was cut by 30 mws and 42 mws respectively.  A purchase from the imbalance has been made.  Also for HE 12,  we bought back most of Harbor Cogeneration's schedule.  Harbor was going to run for 20 mws but could not.  We told Harbor that we would take the charge for them.  Therefore, the -20 mws of generation deviation for Harbor needs to be allocated to ECTRT as Load Deviation.  We put in a purchase of 20 mws from the imbalance in Enpower. 

Finally there is a variance for HE 17 and HE 18 possibly because of load shift from NP to SP.  We are flat in CAPS position manager.  And flat in Enpower.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

<NAME/>,

I just wanted to write and thank you again for affording me the opportunity to visit with you and all the other members of the  Puget trading team.  It was unfortunate we were unable to meet again before my departure so that I could have expressed the above in person, but email will have to suffice.  I very much enjoyed meeting with <NAME/>, <NAME/>, Dana and yourself, as well as with the other members of the gas and power staff.  You have a unique operation and one which appears to have many untapped opportunities that will undoubtedly make your time with the company fairly interesting for the foreseeable future.  I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors and look forward to speaking with you again in the future.

I went ahead and mailed all of my travel information, including receipts, to Jaquelyn <NAME/> as see was mentioned as the travel contact in one of your previous emails.  If there are any other measures I need to take on that front please let me know.

My previous difficulties with my other email service have been resolved.  Therefore, all of my future contact will most likely be through that email address.  In light of this, I simply ask that you direct any future email correspondence to:

Thanks you so much for working on these as fast as you have - there was a priority in getting them out.  However, as you know, the less cash outlay that we have right now the better.  Lets wait and try to offset the amount we owe them with what they owe us - so I say wait until you get July and August done.  What do you think the time frame is on this?

Hey,

The trip to Nashville was good...<NAME/> and <NAME/> actually live in Clarksville (which is about 45 mins NW of Nashville).  We went out to dinner in Nashville both Friday and Saturday night, and spent the day walking around downtown on Saturday.  <NAME/> drove me around the Army base and showed me a bit of the area where they live.  We also went to this Botanical Garden/Museum called Cheekwood...it's the estate of the <NAME/> Coffee fortune.  Anyway, it was fun and very relaxing.  They're house is really cute and their neighborhood requires at least a 1/3 an acre for each house...so there's lots of land.

I haven't made a decision about the Seattle job yet, I actually have until the end of next week to give them my answer.  In the meantime I've been talking to some headhunters and checking out any other options that may be out there.  At this point there is really no telling where in the U.S. I'm ultimately going to end up...which I personally find kind of fun.

We got a total of $350 out of the $400 deposit back (not too bad).  I just deposited the check so all I need to do is drop off a check for $175 to your Mom...which I will do this weekend.

<NAME/> things are still going well there!

I predict that we will not prevail in an objection to consolidation. Judges love to consolidate unless there is a compelling reason not to do so. A one month delay will not be enough to persuade the AJL to not consolidate if you consider the advantages to the judges, so we would need a better reason.  Do we have anything else to go on?  (I don't think the Margate issue is enough, either.)

I doubt we will have the settlement buttoned up by the second week of December, which could leave us in the position of needing to continue the hearing until January anyway.

In September, ENA agreed to purchase capacity from New Power on Transco.  The total demand charge should have been $9,000.00 on contract 4.0159.  New Power released the capacity volumetrically and I didn't catch it.  The actual demand charge billed was $270,000.00.  New Power agreed to reimburse ENA for the difference of $261,000.00.

ENA will pay the pipeline the billed demand charge of $270,000.00 and bill New Power $261,000.00 on deal 1110019.

We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for
	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:

	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless
	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 
	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)

	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will
	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there
	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)
	   
	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle
	     for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction.  Today they
	     only call an OFO before the gas day begins.   Starting Nov. 1, they can 
	     call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and 
	     Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact
	     to SoCal's customers)

	5.  SoCal says the "windowing" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a
	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations
	     exceed their capacity.

	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This
	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that
	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please
	let me know.  Thanks. <NAME/>

Hi <NAME/>,

I'm back in the office, and am working on this deal again.  Seems like there are a couple of items which need to be obtained so we can go forward expeditiously. Specifically, we need copies of the following documents:

	Lease agreement between CES and UST.

	Nortel RTU terms.

	Bankruptcy order allowing the sale of the switch from TCP to CES. 

I can speak with US Telenet's attorney regarding these requests, if you can get his/her name and number or email address.

I know there are some other issues, but getting these documents will really help.

Just wanted to let you know that Palo Alto received some confirmations for transactions that they should not have received.  I think both are related to their term third party purchases that were entered into the system.  One was for 1500, which I think is related to their purchase from BP and one was for 1135 which are third party purchases from us and should already be in the system as several sale transactions to them.

<NAME/>,
	This is from a guy on our floor.  He's a summer intern...and this is his Tuesday morning story.  Incidentally I was standing directly in front of the old women picking out some green onions for my omelet when all hell broke loose.  I took about three steps back and wandered towards the kitchen in search of a fire extinguisher.  Didn't find one, and like <NAME/> (the intern) was a bit disappointed in my reactions...ah well.



I don't usually send out a group email, but listen to this shit.  So I am sitting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks loose.  It is about 630am, and most of the trading has subsided for the morning.  I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that are serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food will last...today is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast from a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used to because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh breakfast for <NAME/> employees, they usually cook it the night before. So, everyone on the floor is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice breakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs.  So, I grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year-old women at the grill.  Everyone is smiling, deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they will get crazy and add salsa or something.  The next thing you know, straight out of a FOX tv show or "You've Gotta See This" episode...this old woman is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago.  The propane tanks heating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide, raising up to ten feet in height.  The place turns into a frenzy. Nobody can move, react, or anything.  Everyone is frozen watching this old woman(picture happy Gilmore's grandma) go up like an old Christmas tree.  A few seconds before this high school chemistry experiment, I was sitting on the first row right in the middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN2 on the 50inch Liquid FlatScreen TV that is directly above my desk. The old woman that went into flames is directly in front of me, about a literal three feet away and I am directly facing the inferno along with a co-worker who is catching the blunt of the heat of the flames. I don't save the old woman like most of you might have thought, I can't do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is going to jump in there and save this poor lady.  The old woman is yelling ,"Somebody get me outta here!"...yet we all continue to stare.....finally, someone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze.  Who is this masked man, I have no clue.  However, I do witness <NAME/> from middle marketing doing his best <NAME/> Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the only one in the office that has a clue where it is. I see someone throwing a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier, which is funny, if not for the fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to blister up.  The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on the old woman, ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me, and torching a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens.  The alarm in our building 3 World Trade Center is screaming, and the smoke is enough to make even Polarek leave the area.  So, the fire departemnt comes and the old woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital.  Who knows what condition she is in, but all I know is I hope I am never around a bunch of vaginas(myself and the rest of us that did nothing) when I go up in flames someday.  Well, I have to get back to work because I have wasted about 20 minutes writing this drama.  Take care, <NAME/>

My hours have dramatically improved, which is nice, and they actually let me take time off for vacation.  I'm reserving the weekend <NAME/> mentioned in September so hopefully I'll see you there.

<NAME/> and <NAME/>, as of today, we have emailed a list by station (7 and/or 16 day charts) to the measurement
	group which needs to be read for PPA's to correct the daily volumes fro the following shippers:

		MidAmerican - 147 stations (It is my understanding you have already 44 of the 147)
		IES - 87 stations
		Interstate Power - 6 stations
		Wisconsin Power and Light - 11 stations

	In order for Gas Logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we would like for Measurement to send 
	us updates on the following information ASAP:

		1.  Which station numbers have or have not been corrected for October.

		2.  How many October charts have been received and how many are outstanding

		3.  Provide status of November chart information.

	Gas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th, which is the time
	frame for the first prior period run.  This is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices.
	As you 	find there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in calling the field, please let us know. 
	This way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts.

	We appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused
	to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing.  If you have any questions, please let
	<NAME/> or I know.  Thanks. <NAME/>

Fines:

     I know you have talked with <NAME/> but I wanted to give my two cents.  I think the fines are a great idea. We must be accountable for VAR.  However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.  The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.  We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.  I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.  This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.

EOL:

We continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.

We believe Dynegy has written a program to mirror our cash markets on their system. When we suspend, they suspend and as our markets move, so do theirs.

apparently an imbalance deal was entered under Teco services and the mark to market flag was not removed.    I show negative new deal value for Teco Services,  when I sold above the curve on their behalf.

The deal has been revised,  as it was to be a temporary placeholder anyway.   This imbal. sale deal will be taken to zero and resold to another counterparty tonight.

Was on a conference call with <NAME/> (TW gas control) and <NAME/> Gruel (Griffith plant) Monday morning (September 3) 
concerning pressure drop at the Griffith plant.  It was discovered that the TW mainline setpoint had been changed to 
reflect the new order of 35,000 for the day.  The plant sent TW a schedule of hourly burns for the day.  They had 
intended to take their 24hr rate with-in 12 to 14hrs.  Asked <NAME/> to raise the TW mainline setpoint to approximately 
120,000.  
After speaking with <NAME/> off line and asked him to open the spead sheet from <NAME/> on their takes asked him to figure
the hourly take for the 24 hrs.  He said that he made a mistake and didn't look at it.  The Griffith plant has been on line
since sometime in April and this should not be anything new to the gas controllers.

<NAME/>,

Thanks for the note and I hope your doing well.  You're right, sometimes introductions sound more like the presentation of a resume than a letter...but I think you pulled it off.

I was able to close on my condo last weekend.  It was a tremendous pain with a bit of the last minute run-around, but I finally got moved in on Friday night.  I don't know about my neighbors yet as I am the only one moved in on my floor so far.  The seller is still finishing the renovation of the place...they are converting it from an old hotel.  My condo is about 8 blocks from my office downtown, so it was great to roll out of bed this morning and be able to walk to work. 

Like you, I am not sure what <NAME/> might have told you about me...so here goes.  I was born on the east coast (Connecticut), moved around for a while, and eventually was towed out to southwest Washington by my parents.  I went to highschool in Kelso (this is where I met and then graduated with <NAME/>).  Then went to college at University of Washington in Seattle.  College was good, if a bit long.  I received a degree in Metallurgical engineering and worked as an engineer in Portland for a year doing failure and corrosion analysis (whoa!).  A bit less than 2 years ago I started working with <NAME/> as a trader, trading hourly electricity in the West.  I started out on shift, but now manage the group and get to work a more normal schedule (usually 10-12 hours a day) during the week.  I enjoy the job a ton, the market changes nearly every day and it beats the hell out of staring at a scanning electron microscope for 4 hours at a pop.

With regards to your visit.  I've been in Portland for a few years now, so I should be able to provide a fairly good guide service around the town.  Depending on when you get here and how things go,  we'll have to see if we can get you outside the city to some of the Mountains and the Coast.  Astoria is about 2 hours away and it's a pretty scenic drive out there (especially if you're from New Mexico).  If the weather's nice we might be able to check out some of the resevoirs and rivers around Mt. St. Helens and the gorge...good swimming, hiking etc.  It should be a blast. 

Have you gotten any closer to firming up when you will be in town?  I am pretty open at the start of July, and although it always rains on the 4th (EVERY single year), that's still a good time to be coming up.  Besides, if you ever thought about moving here, you have to understand why its so green...

It was good to hear from you, and if you have any questions you can give me a call at 503-887-3449.

Take care.

They should if they are dealing with transport, gas daily options,  etc. which are effected by the omicrons.  I would typically go to the leads of the respective regions, tell them which curves are unmapped and let them decide what omicron curve to use ( a lot of times they just asked the trader in charge of that point which curve to use).  

If the leads don't know what the omicron curves are the company's in trouble!

Per our conversation, the following are the fuel management team's assumptions of fuel requirements for Eco at 100% of capacity:

LNG   91,260 MMBtu/day at 507 MW    Heat Rate = 7500 BTU/kwh

LPG   1905 Metric Tons at 507 MW     Heat Rate = 7461 BTU/kwh    (Note: 522 gallons/MT   ,   91,300 Btu/gallon)

No.2   619,000 gallons/day at 465 MW   Heat Rate = 7313 BTU/kwh    (Note: 131,850 Btu/gallon)


Heat rates at less than 100% of capacity will be different from those at 100%. Check with <NAME/> or <NAME/> regarding performance curves.

Call me if you have any additional questions.

Group,

I received a call from <NAME/> McReynold at the BPA today.  <NAME/> was concerned with the level of service that our group is providing.  <NAME/> explained to me the necessity and importance of calling in and reporting the actual amount of energy generated by Grays Harbor and Frontier EVERY hour.  The group at BPA cannot close their accounting books and meet reliability performance measures without our information.  I am meeting with <NAME/> on Tuesday.  <NAME/> is inclined to recommend to BPA that we are incapable of this service because of our inconsistent performance.  Such a recommendation would severely limit <NAME/>'s ability to produce value for our service customers in the near term and would likely prevent us from attracting new customers.  I believe that we can provide <NAME/>'s group with the information that it needs with minimal impact to our trading.

Therefore: 

We must call Grays Harbor and Frontier at the top of EVERY hour.  Then we need to call BPA and communicate the ACTUAL energy generated, not an estimate.  Finally, sign off the hour in the services book.  <NAME/> has provided us with the needed information for each day. Reserves can only be used for the hour that we are in, than we must resupply the schedule from a different source by working with the BPA marketers. If you have a question regarding reserves or pulling a schedule--please call <NAME/> or me.

If this process takes more than 5 minutes, please let me know. It is each trader's responsibilty to make this work.  It should be noted that we need to do this even if the generator is prescheduled, and must to continue to do this until these generators are automatically metered.  And yes, we will be compensated by the Services desk for our work. 

This service is a priority and should be treated as such.

Please see me with your comments and concerns regarding this job function.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

If Chattahoochee converted all of their SFTS  to FTS-1 for the purpose of release, there is no problem with a gap.  If they still hold any SFTS,  they cannot have FTS-1 capacity at the same time, even for 1 month.

The supply from the desk-to-desk transaction (#1075281) is pathed to the transport.  The 1023 contract is an ENA agreement.  So, deal 1075281 transfers the gas to ENA.  ENA then transports the gas on it's agreement on Lone Star.

Let's do lunch next week.  We are moving into the new building this weekend.  I'll be able to show you around (if I'm still here).

We had a tough football weekend.  It's about time we got beat.  We didn't deserve the wins we had.  Anyway, I've got to get to work.  Trying to break $12.00 today.  It's kind of odd...moving into a brand new building when your stock price has reached an all-time low...

Hey.  I went on a company outing to Aransas Pass last week.  Left Wed afternoon and got back Friday afternoon.  One of the pipelines I deal with has a hunting and fishing lodge down there.  It was nice.  I caught 2 redfish - both keepers too!  The guide would bait my hook and throw it in the water.  All I had to do was sit there and look pretty till the fish started biting.  I could really get used to that sort of thing.

The fishing guide said I should expect to pay about $1,000/ft for my fishing boat.  I guess my boat will only be about 4 ft long.   Keep looking for my BOAT.

Let's see - the ex wife came in from <NAME/> for a wedding Friday night.  She stayed with me all weekend.  I took her to the airport this morining.  Things went pretty well - no romance, just good friends.  I introduced her to my girlfriend - we all had lunch together.  That was a little odd.

Nothing else going on.  I'll try to have an update on the legal stuff by Wed.

Later Gator.

Group,
I have copied in a note from <NAME/> at EPE. As you can see they are placing a VERY high importance on economic dispatch of the units. Please be aware that every move with regards to marketing and running their system is under EXTREME scrutiny.

Please call me before you call our customer.

Thanks,
<NAME/>



Correction:
The burner problem is on Newman 3.  (Thank You! Mr <NAME/>)   The unit will be held at 85 MW's until repairs can be made.  The plan is to assess the problem Monday morning and make the necessary repairs.    

If prices continue to be below cost we need to purchase power and back down
local units.  With Copper off, the dispatch shows we need to purchase power for 5 or 6 hours through super peak. 

Depending on load,  GT 1 and GT 2 should be put in the hole (around 7 to 10
MW's each) HE 1:00 through HE 9:00...

If  Market conditions are less than $14.00  BACK DOWN Four Corners...   As
load picks up be sure to pick up Four Corners first!
If there is a reason we have to dump FC power please send me a note!   If
there is any confusion over whether to back down FC CALL.

Any questions or comments please call at  5808  or  915-204-1202...

Recommendation for ENA Pools
1st choice  Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/3/01, no cash flow and everything is pre-petition.
2nd choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/31/01 and deal with one month's cash flow
3rd choice  Terminate pools as soon as possible to eliminate the administrative effort involved.

I've been trying to determine the EES imbalances on Dominion and I'm not having much luck.  Dominion gave me the ENA balances over the phone.  When I called back a day later to get the EES balances, I was told to submit a written request to <NAME/> Saviers, Dominion's in house counsel.  I have not done that.  I would prefer that Dominion provide us a written document stating what the pool balances are as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.  

Based on the pool balances below, I would recommend terminating the ENA pools effective 12/3/01 assuming the following.
	1.  Producer payments for Oct and Nov have not been made and go into the pre-petition bucket.
	2.  ENA owes Dominion gas which is also pre-petition.
	3.  The producers will be able to reallocate their gas for December forward to another marketer's pool.

Items to consider
If we terminate the pools on 12/31/01 or later, ENA will need to sell the imbalance gas and pay the producers.  Dominion will need to provide ENA a method to do this if the pools are terminated.  I would recommend paying the producers after we collect the money for selling the imbalance gas AND after we pay Dominion any gathering/transporting charges associated with those balances.  The volumes are small so ENA will not see much economic benefit from this process.  Also, the administrative effort involved is VERY VERY HIGH due to the small volumes per producer.

Dominion will prefer to cancel the pools with a 0 or positive imbalance.  On 12/3/01, ENA will still have a negative cumulative imbalance.

Most of the producers have not been paid for Oct or Nov 2001 activity.  I assume that since those dollars go into a pre-petition bucket that we should not terminate any producer contracts before 12/3/01.

hey...

i actually just filled my change of address form out this morning...i figured you'd already done yours.  i'm leaving for the airport straight from work tonight and don't get back until sunday night.  i can fill it out monday, but if you would like it done before then you may want to try and tap someone else for the job.

the reason monday is important is b/c someone wants to rent our place and i've told the complex that i'll be completely out by the end of the day monday.  so starting monday night i'm back in northwest houston and w/out a mail key.  on the bright side, i'm getting a fair amount of money back from the january rent (which means we're cool rent wise, i.e. you needn't give me any $ for january).  

i do have an interview in seattle tomorrow morning...i'm nervous and excited.  i've been studying a bunch for the last week and a half or so to try and prep myself.  i think i'm more nervous about not liking the job rather that liking it or not doing well in the interview.  also, i'm going to see "kiss me kate" the musical w/ my friend up there so that should be fun.

i'm glad to hear that things seem to be going so well for you there, you sound awfully busy.  keep us posted on all your many activities.  

<NAME/>

I have sold Frontera a financial swap for $28.50 for hours ending 7-12.    The first 3 hours are for size (300 mw's).  
I would buy hours 7-9 tomorrow for up to $20.      I could buy up to the 300 mw's.     Schedule this to load in the North.
I could also use 200 mw's for he 10 and 150 mw's for he 11.

Calpine has had an offer recently for hours ending 7-9.

If you have questions,  please give me a call,  as this is a very important issue.

Words of advice:

Dont go into the market with a $20 bid for 300 mw's.   Quietly accumulate these mw's if possible.     Do not tip your hand on this deal,  as that would contribute to spiking RT prices.

<NAME/>

Wow...I must say this was the last thing I expected you to be emailing me about.  I'll try and give you a call after work ( around 4:30 or so ) if you want to talk about it some more, just let me know.  I do think it's good that you guys are at least talking about all this stuff regardless of what you decide is the right for both of you.  

Sorry to hear about <NAME/>...that is horrible.  What brings on shingles anyway?  I thought it has something to do with stress, but I could be totally off.

Glad you like the CD...I've been listening to it non-stop.  I'm totally empowered after "I'm Alright" and then plunge into super-reflective mode with "Wildest Dreams".  Get on the <NAME/> Richey web site and read the lyrics and you'll understand why.  By the way, she's playing at Stubb's on June 14th and in <NAME/> at The Fabulous Satellite Lounge on the 16th....food for thought.

As for my call, there was some news...he contacted me around 10 am or so and we chatted throughout the day.  I'll tell you more about it when I call, but you're only going to be a bigger fan.  That of course is the problem I'm having.
