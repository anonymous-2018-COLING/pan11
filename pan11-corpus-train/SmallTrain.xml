joefreid: There is a new MBA guy doing a rotation in Trading, his name is <NAME/> Gaither...have you met him?  Very large, strong looking guy
joefreid: infectious laugh
joefreid: I went to Tuck with him
TXsscott5: no....do you know what trading group?
joefreid: I'll ask him when i can get him on the phone again.  <NAME/>'s name was familiar...I think he just started in whatever group he is in
TXsscott5: hm....but he's on the gas floor?
joefreid: I think...but not sure, will find out
TXsscott5: ok...i can probably track him down....
TXsscott5: mo thinks i was a search dog in a former life
joefreid: haha
joefreid: are you one of those people that can find anything on the internet in less than 2 minutes?
TXsscott5: y
TXsscott5: :-)
TXsscott5: had a huge debate at work yesterday
TXsscott5: is there such a thing as too much water....for consumption purposes
TXsscott5: i was battling almost everyone claiming that the law of diminishing returns applies even to good, old-fashioned water
joefreid: personally? or from a macroeconomic sense (property rights in the West, blah, blah, blah
TXsscott5: personally, as in water in-take into the human body
TXsscott5: and there is such a thing....and it can cause a condition known as water intoxication...
TXsscott5: it's so gratifying to be right ;
TXsscott5: ;-)
joefreid: yes, I buy into the law of diminishing returns.  I've heard of water intoxication and I agree with your assessment
joefreid: that doesn't mean you are right
joefreid: though
TXsscott5: why not?
joefreid: my bad...because you found info on Water Intoxification you are right.  I though you were saying b/c i agreed with you, you were right
TXsscott5: oh...ha
TXsscott5: people were attacking me...saying, "no amount of water can be bad for you" etc. etc.
TXsscott5: and i replied, "at some point your body can't process the water...the system has to overload"
joefreid: too much of anything is bad for you....way to overpower them with your tremendous intellect
TXsscott5: ha
TXsscott5: thx
TXsscott5: i think i've scared them all know
TXsscott5: now
joefreid: Cow them into submission
TXsscott5: i always do....could be why i've heard the words, "you're intimidating" more than once in my lifetime
TXsscott5: oh well....i gotta be me
joefreid: not necessarily a bad thing....when used in moderation
joefreid: Law of Diminishing Returns again...it is everywhere
TXsscott5: ha
TXsscott5: so true
TXsscott5: seriously though....i may have issues w/ challenges and/or the gauntlet being thrown down....i hate being wrong, but i'd rather be wrong than not know the correct answer
joefreid: ...so as long as you can gain the knowledge you are ok?
joefreid: insatiable intellectual curiosity?
TXsscott5: oh, i'll be a little bitter for a while that i was wrong...but i get over it and then i have the knowledge from there on out...so i come out ahead
joefreid: ...I am the guy that will look out the airplane window and marvel how the "wing" provides lift.  The physics of it all and who in the world came up with that?
TXsscott5: that one still gets me
TXsscott5: i mean, really....how cool is that
TXsscott5: this giant heap of metal....airborne
TXsscott5: i took the aviation ground course in college as an elective
joefreid: is it and extrapolation of Bernoulli's Principle
joefreid: ?
TXsscott5: ok...engineer talking to business major
TXsscott5: heard of the principle...but couldn't define it for you 
TXsscott5: ;(
TXsscott5: :-(
joefreid: i realize the whole greater distance over the top of the wing creates a faster wind velocity above than below the wing and therefore causes a pressure differential (low above, high below and this "lifts" the wing.  But it the newtons of lift is dependent upon the shape of the wing, the airflow over it, etc...
TXsscott5: ok.....i'm officially impressed....my dad could talk to you for HOURS
joefreid: That is why for the longest time, maybe even still today, the wings are the most difficult aspect of the plane to reproduce.  Other countries would love for Boeing to outsource the construction of the wing so they could learn how to make it.
joefreid: I'm sure your father would shame me
TXsscott5: no....i doubt, but it would make for some interesting discussion

<NAME/> Jenkins gave me your name as an <NAME/> contact regarding Enovate.

I work for <NAME/> McMichael on the gas side of the <NAME/> Estate team.  <NAME/> <NAME/> schedules gas for the <NAME/> Estate Team.  <NAME/> received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.  I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.  This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system <NAME/> uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.  All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  <NAME/> Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not <NAME/>.  <NAME/> was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate <NAME/>'s access.  Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?

<NAME/>:

Bases on the conversations I have over heard I understand there are discussions being held regarding the <NAME/> Corp 1994 Deferral Plan and the value of the ENE stock held in those accounts related to a single sum distribution.  As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to take their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.  After having struggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number of shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of <NAME/> employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforded a look back option.  Some might say this is easy for me since I did not have ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fairly.  Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.  The solution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation under the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of the ENE stock valuation.  I appreciate your reading my input!

A.K. is looking for the volumes and dollars on deals ENA has done since March 1, 2002.  I would appreciate if everyone would look at my worksheet and let me know if you are aware of something I have not included.

A.K.  I just includes the spot deals that we have done to support term deals or to liquidate storage/park & loan positions that we have.  As I said in my voicemail, you might also be looking for capacity release dollars as well.

<NAME/>,
As discussed earlier,  I am proposing ramping up late for the onpeak sale that Frontera made for tomorrow.       If we must sell the offpeak hours required to affect a 340 mw onpeak schedule,  I show that we would almost negate all profit from the sale.

I am suggesting starting your ramp beginning hour ending 7 and purchasing a fixed price swap from <NAME/> for the short generation.    Basically,  you sold the preschedule for $21 and we would fix your price for hours ending 7-11 at $20.     

The benefit in this swap would be:
hedge against floating price
lock in $1 profit on sale for short portion of the schedule, increasing revenues
avoid losing approximately $10k on selling ramping schedule -  $4 is an optimistic real time sales price at this point,  however,  I used this in the analysis.



Please let me know what you think.      <NAME/> will be offically rolling this swap product out to all of our service customers.   
I  think this would be a good fit your company and I would like to try this for Friday's run.

Additionally,   I think that there may be a good down balancing or OOM down  opportunity for tomorrow because of this preschedule.

<NAME/>, these are the notes I took from Friday's floor meeting.


<NAME/> Leff floor presentation on Friday March 22nd, 10:00 AM
came here 5 years ago, Mechanical enigeer, sold his business FMES in 1997 to EES and been with EES every since.

we have about 1,000 people left in wholesale and retail
about 800 people in support groups
we've lost about 7,000 people since Dec 2nd.

3 things
1.  where is the business now
we know where we are, where we are going, retention\
pooled wholesale and retail resources
figure out how to get the people together

we've completly revamped the sr management team
target recovery of $6 billion dollars for the estate team, this is not a book value or firesell value.
$3 bill in ENA, $1.4 EES  $600 mill enron canada.....so forth.
stan hortin   mike mcconnel looking at packaging deal and assets together to develope a new reorganized company.

2.
we are important, the people that is
all the difficult times are behind us
he understands our urge to leave
take a deep breath, think about how what you do will enhance career.

retention plan should be presented next week, will be filed next week with the bankruptcy court.
creditor's committee has approved the retention plan

plan brings substantial amount of money to bear 
jobs may change
email will go out next week detailing plan
management will talk to people before next friday about how the overall retention plan will impact us and our coworkers


Liquidation bucket - people settleing terminated positions, assets, primarily commercial oriented.  Commision type environment.
Retention Pool - cetain amount of money is paid on a qtrly basis.
Severeance plan - safety net for people not in retention or liguidation bucket.
anyone in severance plan will have their monies offset by any monies they recieve  on one of the other plans.

3.
personal message 
be positive
have some fun
get a bounce back in your walk
you can be part of fixing it
take next year or 2 years to learn and develope.

queston:  what is the goal of the company
we are selling books of business, assets, and substantial amount of backoffice work needs to be done to do the settlements.
we are not going to try and develope new business.

question:  org chart?
We should be developing one over the next few weeks.

<NAME/>,

I don't know if I told you before, but I'm leaving tomorrow for a long weekend in the Caymans with my new group.  I can't tell you how much my life has changed in the last three weeks.  I'm getting out of the office no later than 6:30 everyday (and it's usually closer to 4:30-5:00) and I actually have time to do other things with my life.  I went to the symphony last week, am going to a reception at the MFA next week, joined a volunteer organization geared toward young professionals and am thinking about joining the church I've been going to the last couple of months.  All in all life has improved.  Still nothing new on the guy front, but I'm in no rush so it's not that big a deal.

I am so excited about my trip out to San <NAME/> to see you.  I promise to be well rested and ready to shop, eat and go out....or just sit on the beach.  Like I said before, I'm up for anything.  

<NAME/> things are going well with you, the job and <NAME/>.  Drop me a line if you get a chance and let me know what's new in your life.

Talk to you soon,

POINTY HEAD!!!!!!     I KNEW IT!  Poor little fella.

I like the apartment but the walk to the parking garage is terrible.  I don't think Immer is going to like it very well either when she's lugging the baby around.  Talk about space, I GOT IT!  For now anyway.  Yeah, I've emptied my car of certain items because I didn't want to carry them around.  Hey we need to discuss how to divy those up.  I've always wanted them even though I don't use them.  Dad gave me the single shot 12, but there is still the little one, the double (the prize possesion) and the new one that you wanted to use.

The apartment is still pretty empty.  I didn't want to empty my boxes until we got Immer's stuff in there.  I don't think she has that much either, living room furniture, bed, 2 bedroom night stands, armwour, kitchen talble, 1 stupid cat.....

Group,
A quick note regarding Pace transmission reservations on their oasis sites.  We have recently paid PACE $57,000 for transmission in May that we reserved but did not flow.  PACE says that their transmission is on a take or pay basis.  My contention is that we may have reserved the transmission, but then attempted to remove it immediately (wrong hour, wrong mw value on the submission etc.) and were unable to, or were told by the dispatcher that the dispatcher would take care of it.   Then nothing happens.  There are two things we need to do to prevent this.

	One: Submit our transactions correctly the first time.  Then withdraw them immediately through the Pacificorp Oasis system if there is a problem.

	Two: Send me an email each time the dispatchers remove requests on our behalf, or if We/PAC are/is unable to take the request out of their computer system.

Hopefully, this will prevent the extra charges, or give us a means to pull tapes and contest the charges.

Thanks for your help in limiting these egregious expenses

as for the apt., the first really was bound to be more of a meet-and-greet, lay the groundwork situation so maybe it's just as well is was shorter.  next week you'll be able to actually start examining things w/ her a bit more rather than merely establishing a starting point.

i was reading a bunch of my "With God All Things are Possible" book last night and there was a passage that just totally hit home with me which referenced <NAME/>' reaction to a sinner who approached him.

"he neither condoned nor condemned the sin, he understood it".....it think this is such an important perspective to gain not only in reacting to those around you but almost more importantly to yourself. (bear in mind that this is primarily me talk'n to me, but i thought you might take something away from it as well)

like i said, i'm gonna stick around here for a while and then i will, of course, have the cell phone.  

good luck kick'n the cold.

<NAME/>

PS - if you need a non-drinking partner at the "annual party" i'm in....

I have purchased from <NAME/>   100 mw's at $51  for flow into Entergy (see deal#591863) .       <NAME/> is  transmitting this power through their capacity through SOCO.     In the event of TLR's,   we have the option of cutting this supply,   without booking out (deal was negotiated with Amar).
If this happens,  of course  you need to fill the demand side and cut the purchase from <NAME/> in enpower - see deal no. above.   The purchases  go in the ST SPP book.

Once again,  If RT has to intervene,  please make sure that Enpower is balanced with respect to ST SPP.     Also,   let me know immediately if there are problems with this or any other schedule that I have.

You guys are doing a good job.

This just came to me today.  This information is widely available to corporations and law enforcement around the country.  It will likely hit the media in the next day or so.  This is all the information that is available.

<NAME/> Corp. Business Controls/Corporate Security received the following information via the National Threat Warning system.  While we do not wish to unduly alarm employees, the specificity of the information dictated immediate dissemination to our West Coast offices.  

THE FBI IS IN POSSESSION OF UNCORROBORATED INFORMATION INDICATING THE
POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES,
SPECIFICALLY THE WEST COAST.  REPORTEDLY, UNSPECIFIED GROUPS ARE
TARGETING SUSPENSION BRIDGES ON THE WEST COAST.  SIX INCIDENTS ARE TO
TAKE PLACE DURING RUSH HOUR BEGINNING FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 2 AND CONTINUING
THROUGH NOVEMBER 7, 2001.

NO FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ALLEGED ATTACK IS KNOWN AT THIS TIME.
THE FBI IS ATTEMPTING TO VERIFY THE VALIDITY OF THIS REPORT.  RECIPIENTS
WILL BE UPDATED AS EVENTS WARRANT.

RECIPIENTS WHO RECEIVE OR DEVELOP INFORMATION RELATED TO THIS MATTER
SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THEIR LOCAL FBI OFFICE.

We will keep you apprised if we receive any further information.

Group,

A quick reminder. After reviewing this weekend, we must begin adjust bidding for congestion at ALL tie points. We should be running wheels N-S and S-N across Path 15, the COI and NOB. We have lost significant revenue by failing to adjust bid our transactions. It is still fire season, and unit outages are resulting in unscheduled flow problems that are forcing congestion at different tie points and in different directions. Please check available ATC's on the CAISO site, and spend the time to manage our congestion risk. If you have questions, please ask. We need everyone up to speed on this quickly.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

Good luck.

Yes, you are absolutely correct, I can never get ahold of you.    I know you're very busy.  Our plane get in at 12:00 on Friday, so we'll  hail a cab over to Mom's house.  Everything here is going okay.  I hope <NAME/> has had the baby by the time I get there this weekend.  I sure don't want her to have to spend <NAME/> in the hospital.  As far as dinner is concerned, we'll have the regular, roast, ham, macaroni and cheese, greens yams, etc.  Mom said something about getting a turkey, if so, we'll have to have dressing.

<NAME/>, following are the questions you asked and my answers.  Please give me a call if you have
	any questions. (713-853-7637).  

	1.  Number 4 is still a little fuzzy.  Does Demarc Deferred get allocated during the same cycles as Demarc?

		Answer:  Yes

	2.   Seems unlikely since Demarc Deferred is a storage point and storage is allocated at a different time?

		Answer:  A transportation delivery directly to Demarc Deferred is a part of the Demarc allocation.  
			  When NNG looks at a storage allocation, we review all the injections (or withdrawals)
	 		  at the storage point.  The two referenced allocations are done seperately, but during the same
			  cycle.

	3.  If we were nominating our Firm from <NAME/> to Demarc Deferred where would our customers pull from?

		Answer:  Customers can pick up gas at Demarc Deferred

	4.  The storage that is offered by NNG's park and ride is at what location?  Demarc or Demarc Deferred?

		Answer:  Demarc Deferred

	Hopefully this helped.  Thanks. <NAME/>

	If they are having problems accessing Hottap, give them the pertinent information they

	help the customers through this frustrating time.

	I also appreicate everyone staying around until 6:00 last night.  It is good to work with

	Also, Toby thanks for your "hours" of work on sending out the emails to our customers

This is from a guy on our floor.  He's a summer intern...and this is his Tuesday morning story.  Incidentally I was standing directly in front of the old women picking out some green onions for my omelet when all hell broke loose.  I took about three steps back and wandered towards the kitchen in search of a fire extinguisher.  Didn't find one, and like <NAME/> (the intern) was a bit disappointed in my reactions...ah well.



I don't usually send out a group email, but listen to this shit.  So I am sitting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks loose.  It is about 630am, and most of the trading has subsided for the morning.  I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that are serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food will last...today is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast from a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used to because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh breakfast for <NAME/> employees, they usually cook it the night before. So, everyone on the floor is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice breakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs.  So, I grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year-old women at the grill.  Everyone is smiling, deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they will get crazy and add salsa or something.  The next thing you know, straight out of a FOX tv show or "You've Gotta See This" episode...this old woman is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago.  The propane tanks heating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide, raising up to ten feet in height.  The place turns into a frenzy. Nobody can move, react, or anything.  Everyone is frozen watching this old woman(picture happy Gilmore's grandma) go up like an old Christmas tree.  A few seconds before this high school chemistry experiment, I was sitting on the first row right in the middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN2 on the 50inch Liquid FlatScreen TV that is directly above my desk. The old woman that went into flames is directly in front of me, about a literal three feet away and I am directly facing the inferno along with a co-worker who is catching the blunt of the heat of the flames. I don't save the old woman like most of you might have thought, I can't do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is going to jump in there and save this poor lady.  The old woman is yelling ,"Somebody get me outta here!"...yet we all continue to stare.....finally, someone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze.  Who is this masked man, I have no clue.  However, I do witness <NAME/> from middle marketing doing his best <NAME/> Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the only one in the office that has a clue where it is. I see someone throwing a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier, which is funny, if not for the fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to blister up.  The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on the old woman, ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me, and torching a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens.  The alarm in our building 3 World Trade Center is screaming, and the smoke is enough to make even Polarek leave the area.  So, the fire departemnt comes and the old woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital.  Who knows what condition she is in, but all I know is I hope I am never around a bunch of vaginas(myself and the rest of us that did nothing) when I go up in flames someday.  Well, I have to get back to work because I have wasted about 20 minutes writing this drama.  Take care, <NAME/>


Enjoyable or what?

Gentlemen,

  As you know, I have been working with <NAME/> Lins to negotiate the ISDA agreement so that <NAME/> and the City of Glendale are able to enter into financial transactions.  I spoke with <NAME/> today and he plans to review our latest draft and get back to me with any final changes so that we can send him an executable copy, along with our required documents, for signature next week.  In other words, I am confident that we will have an executed ISDA within the next couple of weeks.

  My boss, <NAME/> Tycholiz, and I are going to be in southern California September 17 & 18 and would like to set up a meeting with you guys to discuss alternatives to swaping out some of your index priced gas supply.  We are available to meet with you after 2 pm on the 17th or at any time on the 18th.  Please let me know when you guys are available and I will set that time aside for you.  

We look forward to meeting with you and expanding our business with the City of Glendale.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Group,

As of HE2 this morning, our contract with MPC was ended. For the time being, we will no longer be balancing MPC's load.

Also, we can only purchase up to 100 mws from APS transmission. Please do not put wheels in to relieve congestion for over 100 mws. But do check the transmission availability on the website and maximize our ability to relieve congestion with APS in the Southwest. These should be the only congestion wheels that we run.

Also, please use PNM not AEP for any sleeving for EPE.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

Listed below are ENA's pool balances as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.  From ENA's perspective, I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01.  That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market.  However, Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance.

Questions that need to be answered, 
	** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier?
	** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?

	

The operations contact at Dominion is <NAME/> <NAME/> (304-627-3213), she is one of the managers over the operations group.  In my opinion, we should terminate the pools as early as possible.

I know, I know....she booked the flight right after we all got off the phone.  The final blow, her ticket was about $30 bucks less than mine (Continental is evil).  Oh and by the way, I think she may be on your flight back to H-town on the 12th...maybe you can switch your seats to be next to each other!  Regardless, still think it's going to be fun and the economics definitely improve with more people.  She does want to visit with some of the <NAME/> people so get ready for a cat fight over precious little niklaus.  I figure at least one of the days she's gonna want to see work people so we'll just get some market shopping in then (and don't forget we'll have to escape to discuss my last escapade).  Anyway, like I said...still thinks it's going to be a good trip.  Let me know what you think about the Italy trip after you have a chance to look...<NAME/> and I have both been to Salzburg, but I don't think either of are opposed to going back.  The town is adorable and there are scenic vistas, not to mention sausage and beer.

Ciao,

Hey <NAME/>,

It was nice to hear from you.  We are in dired need of the upcoming vacation!  Things here have been changing by the day.  To make a long story short, my country is at war and going into a recession, the company that <NAME/> 1, Stacy and I work for was purchased on Friday by another company after finding out that our Chief Financial Officer was involved on some questionable activities - (to the tune of about $3.5 billion) practically taking our company down single handedly, loosing about 90% of the value of our stock,  therefore, we are broke, AND my boyfriend and I broke up.    Things just aren't right.  But hopefully, things will start to get better.  I'm very glad I have a trip (that is paid for!) to look forward to!

How was your gay cruise?  I think I would have a hard time with that one myself!  I do hope all is well with you.  We will all be ready to play and relax in January!  Take care -

This is the last message from the total transfer capabilities folks.  I would like you to find this information and distill the relevant information from it.  We can go through what constitutes relevant information this afternoon.  I am working on adding you to the market status list, this will provide you with market information regarding real-time derates or market orders.  Finally, I would recommend printing the CAISO tariff off and reading it over the weekend or next few weeks.  Boring, but important.

I did run across some missing NSP deals for June and July and some price mismatches for a couple of NSP deals for July.  

For June, 3000/day priced at $4.70 and fior July. 3,100/day priced at $4.79.  Also, I am resending you July and the Yellow highlights show the two deals that I don't agree with the price.

I've attached the prepayment request.  The physical address for the bank is

	Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company
	C/O Bank Of America
	File  #96264
	840 S. Canal Street, 6th Floor
	Chicago, IL  60693

The address of the company we are doing business is 

	Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company
	Nine Greenway Plaza
	<NAME/>, TX  77046

The person I negotiated the deal with is <NAME/> Armstrong, his number is 832-676-5120.
The person at El Paso Corporate Credit (Tennessee is a sub of El Paso) is <NAME/> Baker, her number is 713-420-7446.


<NAME/>,  <NAME/> at El Paso said the only reason she is requiring a prepay for this small an amount is because her records show that ENA has not paid any monies for anything on the El Paso pipelines, including Tennessee, Sonat, ANR, or El Paso Pipeline.  I know that we should have at least paid for the Bear Creek storage on Tennessee.

Is the volume at the inlet and outlet of Bushton factored into any MDQ total?  Gerry
	if you are not the person to help us on this, please let me know who.  Also in talking
	with <NAME/> Darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and outlet of
	Bushton, you DO double your MDQ.  Therefore, if you have 10,000 MDQ you can 
	only nominate 5,000 to inlet and 5,000 at outlet.  

	Gerry, can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical
	on the inlet and outlet of Bushton?   If she is right, then we have NOT had anyone
	nominate on the same contract.  If I have confused you, let's discuss.  Thanks. <NAME/>

We had the best intentions of going to Greasewood flats but were too lazy to drive there.  It was an awesome relaxing weekend and the weather was great!!  We hiked camelback on Saturday.

I will be coming back to PHX to visit Arizona Public Service soon.  don't know exactly when yet.  

Let me know when you feel the need to get away to some nice humid weather - it's good for the complexion, you know!!

Group,
We have had some issues with EpmiCalPool deals recently and I wanted to provide information for newer members of the group and a quick reminder for crusty veterans as we head into the Thanksgiving Holiday. I have also decided to change our protocol for entering multiple EpmiCalPool deals. Please pay special attention to #5 below.

So, some basic rules about EpmiCalPool deals.

1. EpmiCalPool deals are BUY-RESALE deals--(a transmission deal will work but is not the preferred method)

2. We only BUY from the EpmiCalPool-no exceptions-.

3. EpmiCalPool deals have a $0 price in the buy and sell portions. Please do not enter a price on an EpmiCalPool deal.

4. EpmiCalPool deals must have a delivery point of an CISO tie point or an CISO congestion zone. Good delivery points would be:
Malin, COB N/S, COB S/N, NOB N/S, NOB S/N, Cascade, Captain <NAME/>, Summit, Four Corners 345, Mead 230, Paloverde, NP-15, ZP-26, SP-15.

Bad delivery points would include: Mid-C, Hotsprings, Hidalgo, BC Border.

5. IMPORTANT CHANGES TO BUSINESS PRACTICE HERE EpmiCalPool deals are used to simulate the purchase of transmission from the California ISO. 

	a.) If you have a wheel from tie point to tie point for example Malin to Four Corners for congestion management--than an EpmiCalPool deal from Malin to Four 	Corners would be appropriate. For seperate wheels from tie point to tie point we will NOT be putting in deals from Malin to NP-15, NP-15 to SP-15, and SP-15 to 	Four Corners. 

	b.)However, from Congestion zone to congestion zone inside of California, or if you are moving tie point to a congestion zone--for example Malin to SP-15 we will 	need a Malin to NP-15 and NP-15 to SP-15. This will allow us to better capture congestion across congestion zones in California, and will prepare us for the move 	to FSP.

6. We will initiate this change in business practice HE 1 on Tuesday November 20th.

Epmicalpool deals continue to provide problems with reports. Please see me with any questions.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

Tenn Net 284 Contract

Commodity		$.0000
ACA			$.0021
GRI			$.0055

Total			$.0087

Fuel			1.31%


<NAME/>
Commodity		$.0036	  = .003 -.0001 + .0007  ( RTS Commodity - TCRA + Deferred Asset Surcharge)
ACA			$.0021
GRI			$.0000	Note: GRI does not apply on this path because Iroq delivers gas to Tenn at wright (non GRI point)

Total			$.0057

Fuel			.5%   Note:  The Iroq Tariff allows them to charge up to 1% fuel, but I believe the max is 1% for Zone 1 to Zone 2 and .5% for Zone 1 to Zone 1 but I didn't read that in the tariff.  I think Iroq might have told me that back in normal times.

So much wasted time and energy and the well is running dry at the same time the animosity towards <NAME/> and marketers seems only to be increasing. I like the proposal to merge the discussions but... You will recall at the WSPP meeting in Colorado I asked <NAME/> Small if he wouldn't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups.  After a long winded story about the personal pain he has and will continue to suffer (<NAME/>'s name came up a lot), he said he did not think it would ever work.  I'm all for trying to forge this single contract approach and I think EEI members, drafting committee and all, would relish it as well.  What do you think is the next best step?  

ps - the meeting in San <NAME/> on the 1st is still unclear for <NAME/> based <NAME/> employees.  Terrorists Halloween scares have made everyone unlikely willing to fly.  We are trying to get <NAME/> to allow a videoconference but so far no commitment that this is OK.  Lets talk about this also.

Hoping not to stay the course, again.  Talk to you soon.

<NAME/>,
We have resolved almost all of the recent PMA sheet.  The Tacoma/MPC deal is fine if its zeroed out for HE 3.  I just need to have the cost zeroed out as well as the revenue.  Currently only the revenue has been zeroed out and if I receive the credit for buying from MPC I am satisfied.  <NAME/> is aware of this.

I am still having a problem with the WBOM $108,000 as you are aware.  This would be the only outstanding PMA and whatever the problem is with our tools (if any) likely needs to be resolved.

I appreciate your hard work on tracking down this $108,000.
The risk sheet is on my desk.

Thanks,

so...talked to emily last night and here's the deal...

she left sometime this morning to go to round top for a big antiques fair and will be spending the night in NB tonight....

no one has talked to katy as of yet to see if she's going to austin this weekend or not.....

emily talked to matt and he said he was out for doing anything this weekend, but that next weekend would be good...and i think one of emily's pledge sisters and her boyfriend/his friends may try to meet emily in NB next weekend....so it looks like next weekend in NB is a definite gathering....

as for this weekend....depending on work today, which will suck, i may try to drive to NB tonight and spend the night there...i have a feeling i'm going to be relegated to LOTS of family time on saturday and sunday in austin b/c tons of family/friends are coming to the game this weekend and want to spend time with chris and chuck....therefore, if you want to go to NB as well tonight we could certainly ride up together but i'd check w/ emily about a ride back to h-town b/c there's no telling when i'll get out of there on sunday....

either give me a call later or email me back w/ your thoughts...

Of course,  the tariff overrules any answer that we may receive.

Someone needs to call Jerry Graves or myself to schedule a pig run.  We will need to have some coordination to flow gas from the P-3 side
of the Canadian station to ensure you enough gas to run the pig to feldman. 
With max flows from the P-2 area they can run a pig from P-2 to P-3 anytime.  It just needs to be coordinated with the teams and gas
control.
Mickey, hope this answers you questions.  If not call me.  

Let us know.

<NAME/>, Gerry, Raetta and <NAME/>, here are the questions and answer as I recall from the conference call
	today.  Please let me know of any changes or corrections and I will make them then send to <NAME/> Power.



	<NAME/>, here are the questions and answers that we promised you from the conference call on Tuesday,
	November 6.  Please review and let <NAME/> or I know if you need any clarification.

	1.  What fields can be changed on a nomination and the nomination still keep its flowing gas rights from the previous cycle?

		Answer - (1) QUANTITY volume equal to scheduled amount or volume lower than scheduled amount
			  (2) RANK changed to a different number

	2.  Where can I find information on Imbalance Tiering in relation to mandatory monthly cash out?

		Answer - Tariff Sheet 267.D & E (Raetta, so you agree?)

	3.  What points are in the grouping to determine a demarc allocation?

		Answer - <NAME/> (Trailblazer) and demarc are the only two points in the group

	4.  If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is allocated, can <NAME/> Power
	     switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and keep their gas flowing?

		Answer - The field Receipt to demarc deffered delivery IS included in a demarc allocation
			  because the transport tied to this storage nomination is physically coming from
		              the field to the market area. (<NAME/> we may not have been clear on this comment
			  on the conference call)

I used to carpool with a guy and his wife from Liberty.   He asked me one day:  " what if someone called you and told you that you just won a new Towncar - all you had to pay was the $700 in  taxes?"    I told both of them (laughing)  that it was a scam and someone would have to be an idiot to fall for that,  since they didnt enter any contest.
They both looked down at their feet and said that they sent a check to this outfit.    I called them dumbasses again and they called their bank to cancel the check.

The jackass scam artist called them back,  bitching that they had cancelled their check.    My dumbass friend was talked into this transaction AGAIN.
He tried to reinstate the check ,  but the bank's policy prevented him from reactivating this payment.    He was going to do this again,  but I told his in-laws,  friends and everyone else I could to talk to him.   He finally saw the light.   Just doing my job.

Anyway,  this guy is a super nice (but dumbass) guy.    He works at the <NAME/> county courthouse.    His wife ran off with a crack head,  left him with the kids,    didnt come homefor several weeks and then wanted a divorce.    The divorce was in Liberty where this woman,  also a dumbass friend from wayback,   had worked for the Judge presiding over her case.     
She got the kids and he pays $2500/month.

Life is less fair to dumbasses

Please check out the following.     The agreement I reached with Ercot/Frontera yesterday is as follows:
When we receive an OOMC,  we will crank up the plant then call Ercot and request an OOME once the plant is online.
If Ercot doesnt give us an OOME,  then we will need to advise them that we will take the plant down.   We dont actually want to do this,  as there are some expensive start charges associated with this.

We will discuss further in the meeting.

<NAME/>, take a quick look at this would you?

Group,

Going forward we will be transacting with <NAME/> Canada Corp on an over-the-counter basis.  We will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for buying from or selling to them non-firm energy.  <NAME/> Canada will contact us each morning to inquire about possiblities for export and import.  We should be familiar with the <NAME/> Power Pool forecast and be aware of the conversion from CDD to USD.  The lead or NW trader will provide <NAME/> Canada with their estimate or feel of the market.  <NAME/> Canada will be trying nearly every hour to obtain non-firm transmission.  If this is an unwise practive from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market, WE need to tell them, as they are losing $6.40 per mw CDD on unused tranny with zero chance for return.  Further, <NAME/> Canada wants the opportunity to transact with other counterparties at the BC Border.  If we cannot use their energy they have asked to be able to contact WWP, IPC or TransAlta after giving us first look to attempt to recoup some of their loss.  I do not see a need for this and think there is potential for embarrassment and damage to customer relations.  If we are in contact with <NAME/> Canada before hand (start of the day, top of the hour, etc.) we should be able to get them the best price for their energy.  Be very clear in your dealings with the NW counterparty that the energy is non-firm.  Determine a book-out price if necessary to solve problems with physical flow.  We are basically buying a put or a call.  Finally, I would like to see the communication with <NAME/> Canada improve.  Personal experience and observation has us not communicating with them as closely as possible and typically only speaking with their real-time group at the bottom.  I feel we can do better.  I want to prevent a repeat of this weekend (ECC selling/buying from a counterparty in the US without our knowledge) and do not want the NW being scoured by both <NAME/> Canada and <NAME/> North America.  This is counterproductive for both of us for obvious reasons.  Providing a bid/offer and being prepared to act on it is a change in our relationship with <NAME/> Canada.  This should force a renewed emphasis on communication and market fundamentals that should only be beneficial.  If you have questions or ideas regarding the relationship with <NAME/> Canada please let me know.

To be sent to <NAME/> Zufferli (equivalent of <NAME/> B in Canada)
and Portland Shift

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at <NAME/> that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    <NAME/> White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to <NAME/>, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  <NAME/> didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at <NAME/>.  Before I sell the gas, I will 
	1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
	2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

<NAME/>, the point we are selling the gas at is <NAME/> which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address?


Any comments or questions?

If I understand correctly we will make the change for January 1, 2002.  Do NOT change anything

Remember how bad T.A. reported that we all were on putting cuts into the system, enpower work,  reconciliation,  etc. ? 

THESE GUYS DO NONE OF THAT - NO ONE EVEN KNOWS HOW.   

Settlements is working hard,  but TA doesnt say a word to the RT traders here,  as it would be political suicide.     That's why she turned toward us.
She is supposed to be our rep to the ISO,   and I talked to her,   explaining my expectations.   She was squirming  about saying that she or <NAME/> wouldnt know the answers.   Im cool with that,  but cant you find out?   Everything is such a big struggle here.

Im not coming until February at the earliest.    I am an Oregonian.
The freaking mosquitos are terrible now that the floodwaters have subsided.  I forgot about that bit of joy.

Later,
JMf

Yes I can.    I have already started working on this.   <NAME/> Watts will help me get this sorted out ultimately.
Sorry for the imbalance.    
You should see drastic improvement from our side effective immediately.   Have a good weekend.

Thanks for coming to <NAME/> for the meeting.  I know it seems like a longshot but if it happens I think we have an excellent shot at being involved in some respect.

Thanks again.

Hi <NAME/>,

Just wanted to update the status with the ISDA.  I believe that you have received a copy of the new draft with all of the changes that we've agreed to.  If you guys approve of this draft, we can have an executable copy drawn up and sent to you.  As for the outside council opinion, <NAME/> Shackleton is out of the office until next tuesday and her assistant doesn't know how to proceed with this process.  We will have to wait for <NAME/>'s return in order to facilitate that process.  I have sent her an email so that we can get started right away.

Let me know if there is anything else that you need from me or if you have any questions.  I do hope you are able to enjoy the long weekend!

Thanks,

<NAME/>

Sorry Mo....certainly didn't mean to bum you out.  I'm a torrent of mixed feelings today.  Between job prospects, my cold and coming to grips with some of the past i've just been a little detached from myself.  I was also in the midst of a taxing conversation with ted when we were IM'ing and it was bringing back stuff too.  I'm just struggling with this pattern of attaching myself to men who are ultimately either literally not available or emotionally not available.  and this whole mm not contacting me has got me very conflicted....b/c to be honest, i really hope he never contacts me again...but i also feel like him not contacting implies that he believes there is something wrong with even our casual interaction (and i'm not disagreeing), which ultimately makes me feel guilty and rotten.  so anyway...i think i just want something to come along that feels good..whether that be a job,a guy,a location, a massage...whatever.  i'm just very disappointed with mediocrity.  i feel luke warm about too many things. 

and the partying comment didn't make me think of us reverting...it merely made me think of mm and a past conversation we had at a point i could have maybe kept things from going too far. 

give me a buzz tonight when you get home...i'll probably feel tons better after a little nourishment.

Looks like I'll be walking over again today without my buddy.  He works for Northern and he's waiting for a termination letter from <NAME/> and an offer letter from Dynegy.

Maybe I'll see you there!!!   A fellow can always hope.  Indrid still hasn't got me a rind either.  I bet she doesn't marry me now.

Krishna,

I modified the file you sent to me (see attached). For OPT TYPE, what is the code for a Call? for a Put?

How does this modified model look? The data is monthly prices. I changed the formula for Vol. Did I get it right?

<NAME/>,

Please show me a bid for this Cargill Deal.  It is 25 MMBtu/d day, May-October, 2001 with balancing and anything else that typically goes along with it.  I think the best option at this time is just ot get a bid from you.

Also there is a piece at Nicor that goes along with it, but it is a monthly volume commitment, and does not include balancing.  I don't plan to give you that portion, but it may be that the customer does not want it broken up.  The volume is roughly 33,000 for the month.

<NAME/>,
I had tried to reconstruct Sunday the 24th based upon your notes,  but was unsuccessful.    I am going to need you to spend some time straightening this out.     Enpower is out of balance  and the books are as well.  
Risk management/Settlements wants this balanced,  as we cannot tie out with our customers.

We will probably need to restore Enpower to precut status,  then initiate the proper deal entry to handle the cuts that came in.

You mention inadvertancy in your Notes,  but I dont know the particulars of this problem.    I'm sure you are aware that every cut needs to be reflected in Enpower.     If you were in balance when you arrived for your shift,   then you should be in balance when you leave.
The Real Time position manager is used to check whether this happened or not.

Give me a call to straighten this out.

Well, I'm here.  We are not trading.  Actually, we are just hanging around, playing games and shooting the breeze, waiting for the next news story.  It's really odd.  It really is sad seeing all the layoffs.  Especially, when I think of the $ the bigwigs carry home while the honest working people search for a way to earn a living.

Anyway, things are fine for me and the family.  I'd better go.  We've got a crossword competition starting.

And....Alghero.  However, I'm going home tonight to look in my guide book at all of these places so I'll send you another revised email tomorrow.

Get back to me when you can and let me know if you have any strong opinions one way or the other.  Obviously, I'm pretty flexible.

It's so nice to hear from you!

Actually, we're coming this weekend.  We get in around 10:30 on Thursday night and flight out very late on Sunday.  At present we have reservations at the Mayflower Inn, but are debating taking a trip to the San <NAME/>'s (possibly overnight - do you have an opinion on that?...i.e. can it be just a day trip).  Discovery Park sounds great....we are both very interested in doing as much outdoors as possible.  To that end, we were thinking about doing some kayaking if you know of any particularly good places.  I really hope we get a chance to meet up while I'm in town...you may want to give me your phone number so we can contact you once we're in town.

Thanks again,

**Per <NAME/> at EPE, the following is new for 2002. I will attempt to get more information and pass it on as I receive it.**

First, TNP now has a 75 MW call on EPE.  The schedule you see on the unit commitment was called in by PNM on behalf of TNP. Lets keep checking TNP schedules real-time to minimize inadverdant on this sale.  Second, SPS exchange now is 130 MW light load, SPS provides EPE 130 MW at the <NAME/> tie and EPE returns the power 100 MW at PV and 30 at FC. Again, this schedule will have to be verified real time with SPS/PSCO.

**The TNP schedule is verified with PNM and is delivered at Hidalgo. 25 is firm just like the last two years, 50 is econ. and can be varied by PNM each hour.**

Please ask if you have any questions.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

We have created a quick quide to do QSE trades through the Ercot Portal.    This initial guide should get you started, however,  this is not a comprehensive handout that contemplates every situation.     I am asking you to read the rules and implement a trade using the Portal.    As you have noticed,   our counterparties have already started trading two hours out.       We will be trading paralell until the ISO rolls out for Friday.   This means that you will have to submit the "traditional" Ercot Oasis and also submit the QSE trade.    We must monitor to make sure that our counterparties have submitted their matching QSE trades, as well.   Otherwise we will be out of balance with Ercot.


A copy of our QSE quide will be in your inbox.     Make sure that you read/ study it and ASK QUESTIONS.


Thanks,

Fines:

     I know you have talked with <NAME/> but I wanted to give my two cents.  I think the fines are a great idea. We must be accountable for VAR.  However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.  The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.  We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.  I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.  This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.

EOL:

We continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.

We believe Dynegy created a program to mirror our cash markets on their system. When we suspend, they suspend and as our markets move, so do theirs.

Group,

We are long for the 13th in California, 25 mws under ST-WBOM in NP-15 at $57.  

We are also long 22 mws under ST-CALI in NP-15.  ST-CALI is also short in the morning in SP-15.  They are short at around $30.  ST-CALI is providing us with a sheet detailing their positions for RT, we will now be providing them with a sheet each morning detailing their sales from the previous day.  Going forward, please put all the ST-CALI sales or length in the service sheet beneath our activity.

We are also short 10 mws to EWEB for HE 1-12, Willamette has a month long sale at $270 but needs to come down unexpectedly for maintenance.  We will backfill this and split any profit with Services.

Finally...

We must check out with BPA each hour for Frontier and GCPUD.  Please make the call right after you call EPE dispatchers (between 25 after and 35 after).  The new service sheets have a place for initials for the call each hour, please initial after making the call to BPA (ext. 2277).

ALSO...TIMBERS TOMORROW NIGHT!

Thanks again,

Yesterday <NAME/> Drapper (sits a few rows over from us and works for EES) asked me what the status was with the Dominion producers.  I told him we were still waiting for Dominion to call us back.  He said that <NAME/> Holmes told them to "just pay the producers".  I told <NAME/> that I wouldn't do anything without knowing what <NAME/> and legal are doing.

Sounds like a little tendency to "split up".  Just like the old days.

Proposed procedures on how we will handle cuts from now on are also included.  <NAME/> is making every effort available to ensure that PP&L receives 100% of the gas that they call on.  I feel that we need to formally agree to these procedures, either in the form of an amendment to the agreement or a formal letter signed by all parties.

Please let me know if you have any comments regarding these procedures and how you would like to proceed.

We finally found the right person in the KN Energy organization for the 18 dth <NAME/> Obligation.

	KN will nominate today for Gas Day 26th going forward.  We told KN that they will have a penalty
	of $25.00 per dth for each day they did not nominate.  18 dth x 25.00 = $450/day x 3 days = $1350.

	We also told them we have been leaving messages since Saturday.  We left messages at 
	3 different offices.  KN admitted to seeing the posting but "did not understand" the obligation
	and they did not call for clarification.

	If you have any questions, please let <NAME/> (Ext. 7429) or I (Ext. 7637) know.  Thanks. <NAME/>

Group,

Ryan sent this email out once already, here it is again.  The oasis site map is http://www.nwoasis.org/OASIS/NODE
The details of checking for ATC are as such Red=PAC(t), Blue=IPC(t)

Leg 1. PACW to ENPR
Leg 2. ENPR to BOBR
Leg 3. BOBR to PATHC
Leg 4. PATHC to PACE
Leg 5. PACE to FC3

We can do a buy resell with EPE to move this to PV or can use APS tranny to move this to Mead or PV as well.
When scheduling from BOBR to FC3 on PAC (t) be sure to just put in the POR/POD and do NOT schedule each wheel seperately.  This will prevent us from being charged $5.84 each time.  Total cost for this tranny should be $5.84 +$2.38 +$5.84 = $14.06.  There will also be losses.  If using this wheel for a services customer, be sure to add in for losses and scheduling fees.  Also, be sure to LOG OUT of the IPC website when finished, otherwise we will be locked out if we time out!  There should already be a template for a tag to move this energy from PAC system border in the NW to FC345.  This path has had approximately 400 mws of tranny availabe the last few days.
Please see me with questions.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

Sonat Park & Loans

2/19/02  History  - Per <NAME/> Dyer at Sonat (205-326-2007)
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Dec 2001 or Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001 that ENA has not paid for.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before <NAME/> declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).

H. & C. were suppose to get back from Hawaii on Saturday.  H had to leave on Sunday for Maine but was suppose to return last night or today.  I don't have Mrs. Mauney's number but I think my mom has it if you want to call her - 901-396-0399.  Still trying to figure out this weekend.  I would love to play golf instead of go to that dumb picnic.  One problem is that I pulled the daylights out of my left hamstring and it is affecting my game.  I will keep you posted.

<NAME/>,

Attached is my new and (in my opionion) improved spreadsheet for the citizens deal.  As you can see, there are slight differences between my calculations and <NAME/> Cogans. the main issue is as follows:

1)Calculation of the spread - he is taking the greater of PG&E topock minus $.10 minus pipeline demand charges OR SJ + fuel.  This can create a negative spread value equal to pipeline commodity charges (which we are reimbursed for).  The results of all of this is mulitplied by $.085.  I am assuming that the floor for the spread is SJ, therefore, the spread = zero if it does turn out to be less than zero.

I hope you have time to review - Once this is fixed you are done - just collecting money.  I am working with <NAME/> and <NAME/> to get the orig granted.

thanks,

<NAME/>

Hello again,

I talked to <NAME/> <NAME/> yesterday and exchanged emails with <NAME/> - looks like they are thinking of a girls weekend in Chicago Oct. 26 -28.  If <NAME/> didn't ask you for your address before, she needs it - as do I.  How does that look for you?  I can get a ticket right now for $188.  

I do wish you would come down here with <NAME/> sometime.  Of course I would want to have you for part of the time you were here!  <NAME/> could come too - we could go to dinner or I could have a bar-b-que or something!

Yes - I am still hanging out with <NAME/>.  Things are good. He is very nice and lots of fun! 

Keep me posted on the girls weekend and I hope things are going well for you!

Love, <NAME/>

I just got a call from <NAME/> Hyatt, Director of Marketing at TW.  He said that Sempra just called him and wanted to know why WE locked the points on the contract in our posting.  I told him we locked them because we didn't want to get billed a potentially higher rate.

1)  This guy acted like he knew me and of course I was embarrassed so I acted like I knew him, AND I DON'T EVER REMEMBER TALKING TO THIS GUY.  He knew that I had gone to EES and that was back in 1997-1998.

2)  Sempra told <NAME/> that we would get more value if we let someone change the points.  I wonder, even though we might get billed max rate, would it be possible to allow the replacement shipper to change the points for "the term of the release only AND the releasing shipper would be billed more that max rate" and that way the capacity would go back to its original contract points in October.

Just a thought.

sure,

e.g.	Buy Jul-Aug Cin power at $50, sell Jul-Aug NatGas at $2.885
	$50/$2.85 = 17.5 HeatRate

	To hedge:  sell 28 contracts/month gas
	50 MW = 32,000 MWhours (50 MW x 16 peak hrs x 5 peak days/wk x 8 wks = 32,000 MWh)
	32,000 MWh x 17.5 = 560,000 MMBtu = 56 contracts over Jul-Aug strip

	Just do the reverse math at 18 heat rate to figure P/L...

Check this out...you should read Liar's Poker by <NAME/> <NAME/>, and Den of Thieves.
Good stuff.
 
 
He notes that <NAME/> management lacked an 'honor among thieves,' but predicts that <NAME/> alumni will flourish. I suspect he is working on the <NAME/> book right now.---sch
Is <NAME/> the New Drexel? 
By <NAME/> <NAME/>, the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.''
Berkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- <NAME/> Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. 
The boss, <NAME/> Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers. The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press. Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company! And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie. 
Understandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one. 
Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, <NAME/> Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it. But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay. 
Alumni <NAME/> Flourish 
True, in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them. And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and <NAME/>'s energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust. 
Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business, former <NAME/> traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and <NAME/> Energy Corp. Well before <NAME/> Lay emerges from his legal hell, the energy trading business will return to normal. 
But the morality of the cases are entirely different. Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves. 
There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones. He paid himself huge sums of money, but he also made huge sums for his firm. He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him, and they loved him for it. The <NAME/> bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag. 
Different Motivations 
<NAME/> created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was. Milken created an operation which was, if anything, much more profitable than it looked. What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits. What <NAME/> hid was the sneaky way it made its losses. 
(This is something I still don't understand, and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain, as <NAME/> seems intent on explaining nothing. The off-the-books partnerships that brought <NAME/> down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets -- Turkish gas pipelines, Indian power plants and the like. Why did <NAME/>, which made its money as an intermediary, invest in this stuff in the first place?) 
The speed with which the markets have punished <NAME/> reflects the differences between it and Drexel. In Drexel's case, it took a multiyear investigation by the U.S. government, together with a smear campaign in the press, to bring down the business. In <NAME/>'s case, all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out, among other things, that senior executives were profiting at the company's expense. 
In Drexel's case, the demise of the firm and the jailing of Milken was pretty much the end of the story. In <NAME/>'s, the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top. Anything is possible.

We have not scheduled this load as of yet.   I met with Narasimha yesterday in order to cut through the b.s. and get at least a rudimentary plan in place.
Here it is:
	By 7am - EES submits to us their  load plan / hedges - EES to use their forecast initially.
	We cover open position and submit schedules to Ercot
	We monitor Real Time and handle continigencies
	Wholesale settlement provided,   ancillary service charges , local congestion,  etc is to be passed to EES.

Narasimha will provide the load info and we are projecting a September 1st start  at the latest.    

We are preparing a term sheet today that will reflect the basic requirements above.    We will certainly add more complexity to this deal in the form of fixing exposure to A/S and other charges.   
We are prepared to go forward with this immediately.

Things have definitely been difficult over here. In truth, I may have underestimated how prepared our systems and the folks in our group were to move dramatically greater volumes. We are moving through a period of adjustment and should be back on track by tomorrow.
So <NAME/> probably is not any more stressed out than anyone else. She probably just shows it a bit more.
We shouldn't be holding you guys back too much longer.

Jerrry,

See the attached megawatt awards for tomorrow.    We are talking with the Ercot staff regarding the settlement of this and the	OOM  (Out of Merit)  decrease for today.   It is our understanding,  per the protocols,  that when we are dispatched down the ISO keeps our $35  scheduled sale  whole.    We are paid this revenue stream (by our sale counterparty) PLUS the greater of:  the applicable balancing energy price for that hour or zero.    If you are decreased by 50 mw's for an hour you receive:
$35 sale + balancing $33.50 = 68.50/mw for not running your plant.   

For the capacity tomorrow,
We will reserve the mw's below and possibly sell the rest.    The Resource Plan is increased to reflect 400 mw's plus the awarded megs for each hour.    The EMS will only show 400 mw until we get deployed.  
  At the time of deployment,  we also receive the balancing energy price for the hour exercised.
We bid in a  Non-spin product which requires us to respond within 30 ".   They can take partial hours, at their option.

I hope this helps.

I slept good also!
Today is supposed to be close to 90, but then the front moves through and Thursday is supposed to be 74
I would like to do the half marathon with you but unless I have allot more free time I don not think I can get into a shape that I could run that far! 
I'm really fat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm getting pressure or inferences that if I do not drop things my bonus might not be there!
Saying things like it would be a shame to have such a good year and then have it blown in the fourth quarter!
They really do not know that such comments just makes me more committed and perhaps with a vengeance!
It does get me down because I'm not sure mankind is worth it!
If people you thought had standards, ethics and morals are now applying pressure, whets the use?

Sorry, to be complaining!
Talk to you later!

I did take a look at the $139,000 home.  This house has been on the market for awhile.  The backyard sits next to some big building - that's a bad thing.  I have not had a chance to look at the other house - the sq footage seems really small though.  Based on what I've seen over the last 8 months, it would take something around $190's - $205's to make me happy and I'm not willing to spend that much right now.

Another thing that bothers me is the economy.  All I hear about are layoffs.  The only industry still booming is the energy industry and we keep streamlining.  That's what keeps me from spending the big bucks on a house.

Thanks for the info though.

Good morning!

I talked with <NAME/>'s assistant yesterday (he was out all day) and she said that they can't send an adjuster out without first filing a claim.  To that end, she said it's generally not a good idea to file a claim (it goes on our record) unless we know there's damage.  So, she suggested that I have a roofer come out and look for possible hail damage and, if there is damage, provide us with his estimate for repair.  Then we should file a claim if need be.  So, I'm on the lookout for a roofer who will do that for us.  If you think we should use <NAME/>, I'll call him.  But, I feel like he might not provide us with an unbiased opinion, if you know what I mean.  Talk to you later.  :)

           Mirant (close out positions only)

Physical Trading

East - The East did not notice any credit hording in the morning.  In the afternoon Tractebel is buying the physical balance of month .04 over the GD swap

Central - Dynegy Canada sold most of the gas to us.  The desk bid was .05 over NGX.  Nicor Hub would not accept an $87 pre-pay for a wheeling fee.

West - EOL Socal cash was trading .08 higher than ICE Socal.  The desk finished short and the market made it very difficult to buy.  EOL SJ cash traded .10 to .20 cents lower than ICE.  The only point without a credit spread was <NAME/>.  Liquidity picked up slightly from Thursday and Friday, but still slow.

AEP was noticeably absent from all regions.

Please let us know if we start getting complaints from our customers.  
If anyone has other ideas or comments please let us know.

Example:

Non-Grid--    San <NAME/> Scheduled      870,000
ID/1                                                                875,000
ID/2                                                                875,000

They want to do a 20 year, fixed price transaction with 10 % swing at that price.  All other gas outside the 10% swing will be priced at Gas Daily +/- $.05.  We are adding a $.25 premium on the 10% swing and the baseload is approximately 1000/day.  If the credit requirements are different for a 10year deal, they would like to see what those are - that might sway them.

<NAME/>, I know I have been bugging you about this but I do need it in order to go forward with trying to get this deal.  And they have asked me for this credit information twice today.  It's all about you!!

Thanks a million for your help!

<NAME/>,

How was <NAME/>?  Did you get the rest and relaxation you were looking for?  How about golf?  Everyone has only ever had good things to say about <NAME/>.

Audi TT?
NICE pick.  Is that a 6-speed?  Only 23,000 miles is pretty sweet and the color is right (matches the 400E).  Next time I am down there (?) you'll have to provide a demonstration.  I am really getting the urge to lose my 525 (this seems to happen about every 6 months), I have only driven it once since I moved (about 5 miles total).  Kind of hard to justify $+500 a month for car, insurance and parking when I drive it 20 miles in a month (just not very cost effective).  An old 2002tii would only cost me parking and insurance (and my pride).  Other ideas?

So I am in the new place.  It's great!  Perfect location (just no parking), and I get way more sleep (til 5!).  Its got a pretty solid view and feels much bigger than it is because of all the windows.  Now if I could just get some furniture...maybe a table...

Group,
	We will be taking over the dispatch of <NAME/> Canada Corp.'s Sundance 3 and 4 units for the evenings of July 19-July 22 (beginning at 18:00 PDT and ending at 6:00 PDT every day, except July 20, where the start time will be 15:00 PDT).

Here is a note of things to remember:

?	SD3 will be coming down for maintenance July 20 at approximately 20:00 PDT.  The plant will call with updates periodically.  Please record this information in the dispatch log.  This can be accessed through the 'Albertapower' site.  Scroll down from Fundamentals to Admin, and at the bottom of the page is the dispatch log. The fundamentals site can be found at  http://albertapower/xnav/default.htm 

?	SD4 has all of its power offered into the Pool at $5.  That's 353MW @ $5.  Therefore you shouldn't have to worry about dispatching the plant up and down.

?	ECC's  telephone line (403-974-6900) has been forwarded to your line for the required hours.  You will receive phone calls from the power pool or the plant on this line.

?	The number for the plant is 780-960-7803 and the number for the power pool is 403-233-7403. 

	You will have to access the power pool ETS website in case an energy restatement of our Sundance units is needed.  This most likely won't happen.  In case it does, the site is www.powerpool.ab.ca.   [You must Login (top right hand corner) as <NAME/> A. Zufferli-this MUST be done on my computer.  Click on ETS, then Submission.] - our passwords are not currently working...so... you can call the <NAME/> powerpool for help. You can then restate the offers of SD3 and SD4 as required. Unless something changes you will need to fax the resubmission to <NAME/> Power Pool and have them resubmit it.  

?	If you have any problems you can reach <NAME/> Greenizan at 620-1180 or his pager at  billgreenizan@epagenet.net.

	PLEASE CALL ME WITH QUESTIONS!
Thanks,

<NAME/>

I asked <NAME/> Mann about that and she said that if we want the gas for April then we should continue with "business as normal" which means we pay for the whole month since that is what we've been doing.  She felt that paying for the whole month was better than paying for just 5 days worth of gas.

<NAME/>,

While on my adventures west yesterday, Burbank and Pasadena expressed some interest in the Peaker product that Lucci and Fuller were peddling a month or two ago.  Burbank is interested in looking at a 30 day call out of 365 days (Cal 02) for 5000.  Pasadena would like to look at 10 days out of the winter.  They just want indications for comparison to regular calls.

I know you will have questions - please come by and we can talk about them.  I left my notebook at home and feel lost today.

Thanks for the info for the additional load.      As I understand it,  we now have approximately 20 mw's in the South.  This is great!!
Each day I review balancing energy prices vs.  daily prices and the choice is extremely simple:    We allow the pool to fill this load.

I would recommend against buying any hedges against this power until further.     There is a good chance that prices occasionally go negative for offpeak/weekends and we want to take full advantage.

Do we need to discuss this further?   I just want to be on the same page.

Dad asked if I wanted to lend you some money but I am reluctant to do it at this point in time since:

a) I am not completely at liberty to touch all the cash that I have received lately for concern that it may be taken bank under potential
creditor action against <NAME/>.  Unfortunatelty, without this cash, I really can't afford to lend any.  The cash that I received recently represents 80% of the cash that I have and I am not sure when I can count on this cash with any degree of certainty.  Therefore, I am reluctant to touch this money for at least 6 months.

b) As of right now, I don't have a job after Feb. 28.  The new company deal that <NAME/> is trying to structure with its traders and a new buyer will not be 
done until the month.  If this deal falls through, then I have to find a job with another company.  In this case, it is most likely that I will have to move back to the 
US since my contacts and the most lucrative opportunities (i.e. compared the the new <NAME/> deal) are there.

c) If I had the cash to give, Dad asked that I could give you a discount to the bank mortgage.  With discount rates near 5%, even if I gave you a mortgage at
4%, I don't think the monthly interest saving for you would be material enough.

d) I think it is good for you to develop a credit rating with a bank through a mortgage.  It is very beneficial for later on in life.  Paying visa bills does help you a bit in this
category, but not like a mortgage.


Hopefully, you can get the financing from a bank.  I think that this is the best solution in the long run.

As we draw near to the HPL transfer to AEP on June 1, I wanted to remind everyone about the Bammel Ad Valorum Tax.  As we discussed earlier this year the Tax needs to be split between <NAME/> and AEP based on the number of months ownership during the year.  Since the actual liability is not likely to be known until August or September
I assume both parties will have to reach agreement as to how to handle this matter.

Deal 717768 should be kept whole.  This is a baseload purchase.  Deal 544392 should still act as the swing buyback on days that the plant underpulls.

FYI.  Anytime a purchase is done at an industrial point with a fixed price, the purchase should be kept whole.  Only the buybacks with Gas Daily pricing take the swings.

Hey, <NAME/>

Thanks for the golf journal.  I'm looking forward to using it.  I've read through most of it already, and it looks easy enough to follow.  Golf is just like everything else, it just takes the disciple to practice and to practice correctly.  I know the tips will help me.  Keeping notes is good idea also.  Thanks, also for the golf towel.  I've got a round coming up tomorrow with a few guys from work.  Maybe I can sleep on the book tonight get a little advantage.  If I play like the last time (when <NAME/> and I played over Christmas), I'll be buying balls from the club house.  Anyway, I hope you are doing well.

Below is a discussion of some of the key contractual issues surrounding the 2002 Winter Cargo. You may also want to review the contract to gain an understanding of how the delivery dates are set for the Last Cargo of 2001, the 2002 Winter Cargo, and the 2002 Early Spring Cargo.

We can discuss this opportunity for Eco in a few days after you have had a chance to familiarize yourself with the issues.

Regards,

<NAME/>

<NAME/>,

ENA has acted as agent for Tenaska IV , a generation facility in Cleburne, Texas, in which , <NAME/> has ownership interest.  Our role was to manage the fuel requirements for the plant.  This includes scheduling, invoicing, and settling the natural gas supplies and transportation.  In addition to the daily activity, ENA has the responsibility to sale any excess fuel from the baseload supplies and purchase an additional fuel needs.  Any profits/losses are passed on to Tenaska IV.  ENA is just paid a monthly fee for the service.  <NAME/> Hill is my contact person for the project. He is looking into finding another party to handle this fuel management responsibility.  If he can't find a party willing to do this under similar terms, we will need to find some one with the <NAME/> estate to handle this.  The problem with <NAME/> continuing in the role is the inability to transact in the gas market (no customers willing to trade with us).  So, the project is losing value.  Please give me a call when you get a chance.  Or, maybe we can meet sometime next week to go over this.  My schedule is pretty flexible.

As a follow up to the written warning on August 14, 2001 to <NAME/> Dubose regarding her poor job performance I would like to submit the following commentary:

<NAME/>'s phone coverage is still very inadequate.  I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.  She consistently does not take messages properly.  Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.

The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.

We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.


In summary, <NAME/>'s performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.  She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office.

DJ <NAME/> CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--<NAME/> Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive <NAME/> Lay could
receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s
(DYN) plan to acquire <NAME/>, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,
2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. 
  In August, Lay, chairman of <NAME/>, resumed his position as CEO following the
resignation of <NAME/> K. Skilling, <NAME/>'s then-president and CEO. At that
time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. 
  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an "excess
parachute payment," according to the filing. 
  Dynegy plans to acquire <NAME/> in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. 
  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is
entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment
within the 60 days. 
  <NAME/>-based <NAME/> is a utilities and communications company. -<NAME/> Lowrey;

They are correct, Cilco city gate does not exist....the only reference point is the Nicor city gate.  As far as the guarant, I'm okay, but the last time we asked them to draft the guarantee, it was horrible.  I'll ask them to send us a draft.

<NAME/>, we have a deal on Trunkline where Midland can request up to an additional 1,700 per day and it could be just 1 day over the weekend too.  Reliant has storage that can flow into Trunkline Wla.  We don't have a pricing mechanism in place so its pretty much automatic and Reliant can bill us whatever they want.  If it ever happens on the weekend, <NAME/> and I will discuss the pricing the following Monday.  Its only happened once in the last 2 months but YOU NEVER KNOW, especially if it happens on the weekend.

If I remember correctly, Midland would call <NAME/> and <NAME/> would call Reliant.  Are we sill set up that way?

<NAME/> and <NAME/>,

<NAME/> and I were wondering if it would be possible for you to make copies of all the existing transportation contracts for the <NAME/> desk and Fed-Ex them to the <NAME/> office.  Currently we do not have any of these contracts available to us here and feel it would be beneficial to have them on hand.  As you know, we are both trying to get up to speed on this book and all it's components and therefore it is important that we  understand all of the available options these contracts allow us.  

Below is a list of the contracts we have broken out on a summary sheet:

	-36169000
	-36177000
	-33084000
	-33085000
	-33038000
	-31029000
	-33171000
	-33175000
	-116388
	-903145
	-IT-601
	-41066000
	-41075000

If there are contracts missing from the above list, please include them in the packet as well.

Thanks for all the help,

Steph,

Good morning! How are you doing? It seems like I haven't seen you or <NAME/> forever. Things are going well here in Portland. The bankruptcy of <NAME/> has been a bit rough, but I am optimistic that the auction on January 11th will see the trading portion of our business bought out by a credit-worthy entity. If we are bought out, we should be back up and running by early spring. Right now, I am just working on systems upgrades and trying to learn as much as I can so we are ready to rip when we have credit again. Portland has been fun the past couple weeks, there are a few new clubs and living downtown continues to be a blast. I enjoy being able to walk everywhere and being downtown has really aided the Christmas shopping. I haven't been up to Seattle in a long time but I need to get up there. I am thinking about coming up for New Year's... any good ideas?
 
Anyway, hope you are doing well and are all ready for the holidays.
Take care,

<NAME/>

It appears that Ercot is reversing their interpretation.   We still need to dispute/collect for OOMC payments and also file under OOME heat rate provisions for all of the times that we ran when we were under OOMC.
Does this make sense?

We also received congestion revenue for HE 10 through HE 18. HE18-although it shows nothing from the CAISO on their site (their server went down) is the same as HE17-the CAISO specifically relayed this to me on a recorded line.

Greetings - I have attached the most basic expectations for our group.   We have been spending a lot of time balancing the books lately, and the attached will relieve some of this, so we can focus on trading.   I will make sure that we receive balanced books from Day ahead trading/scheduling.
Also,  make an effort to know why we run reports, etc.  so that you can make suggestions to streamline this operation. 

I will provide more documented general procedures and will spend time with each of you on how to handle cuts in Enpower and Lotus Notes.      

We have a good group and we will do well in the new market.    However,  this will take an extra effort from each of us.
If you have questions about any of the expectations,   ask.    That is why we make the list.

Thanks,

<NAME/>, things were quite on NNG and TW overall for the weekend.

	For all three pipes the reps had to go through RAZ to get into TMS on Saturday morning.
	Although, the customers were able to get in OK, but the system was slow.  System was fixed by 11:30 a.m. 
	Saturday morning.

	On TW - For Gallop <NAME/> has sent you an update.

	Overall for TW the prices for the east are not covering variables to go west, therefore
	most of the gas is staying in the east market.

The CIA had an opening for an assassin. After all of the background checks, interviews, and testing were done there were three finalists...2 men and a woman.

For the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. "We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside of this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Kill her!!!" The man said, "You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife." The agent said, "Then you are not the right man for this job."

The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. Then the man came out with tears in his eyes. "I tried, but I can't kill my wife." The agent said, "You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home."

Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions, to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, "This gun was loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair."

Hey <NAME/>,

Nice to hear from you.  I know you just talked to <NAME/> the other day so I got a little more detailed update from her.  I'm sure she told you about our trip over to London...we had a really good time which included me spending a small fortune.  Oh well, money's meant to be spent, right?  Anyway, sounds like you've got some really exciting activities to look forward to over the next 6 mos to a year.  Can't wait to hear all about the baby when it arrives (the first in the family is always exciting) and I know you and <NAME/> are going to have the best time jaunting around Europe.  I wish I was planning the same kind of trip right now.  As for your future beyond that, have you been to Seattle before?  I'm taking a long weekend there with a friend from work and would love to hear more about things to do if you have any advice.  Otherwise, I'll be sure to let you know what I found on my own visit.  <NAME/> things continue to go well for you and we'll have to get together when you come back to Texas...

<NAME/>,
We have a question related to the acquisition of ancillary services;       Ercot publishes their various A/S requirements on a daily basis.
We have noticed that you dont procure up to the amount that you say that you require.

For example,  on 9/27,   Ercot published that the System Requirements are 1,800 mw for Regup.      Ercot procured only approx. 117 mw's each hour.
The same thing occurs for REGDN and Responsive.

Is Ercot satisfying their reserve requirement needs with OOM and Upbalancing,  etc.?

I will be out of the office next week,   so can you reply to <NAME/> <NAME/>-Smith?   His e-mail is doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com.

how long it will take?

Thank you.

Sunil,

I just checked my messages this morning....I didn't think people could leave messages anymore after I was put on a trading phone but low and behold they can.  If you ever want to get a hold of me in the future, the best bets are email and cell phone (713-775-6472).

I'd be happy to chat with you if you still need to.  Just let me know a time and place and I'm there.

Please use the following:

Cell -  813-760-7199
Office - 813-228-4907 (should roll over to his cell after hours)
second line in home:  813-634-7772


We have had problems locating Jerry on occasion in order to affect schedule changes.   He lives in a rural area and his cell phone doesnt always work.    In these instances, we tried to contact the plant to instruct them to increase/decrease generation.    They have refused in the past, as they were only to receive instruction from Jerry.

The plant should now be aware that this communication problem can exist and will be receptive to making generation changes per our instructions.

We are required to input down balancing bids for all generators that we represent.     Every morning it is especially important that we have a DBES bid input for Frontera.
We should have balancing bids in for all hours,  but we are most likely to be deployed in the morning hours.
We are required to monitor the Deployment instructions and communicate any instructions to Jerry Watson @ Teco/Frontera.

Frontera is willing to pay a max of $10 to decrease their gen.    This bid tells Ercot that we are willing to pay up to $10 for Ercot to fill our schedule during the time that we are being "balanced down."

We should never see prices below $10 without being deployed down.     If this situation happens,  we have to explain to Frontera why we didnt get selected by the ISO.
This is an important part of the Services side of our business,  and is the only way that we get paid on these type transactions.


If anyone has any questions on this, please give me a call as this is very important to all of us.'

<NAME/> and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at <NAME/>.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.

How's married life treating you these days?  I hope things are good with your job, home, etc.  

I was actually writing you to try and get <NAME/>'s email address.  My friend <NAME/> and I are going to Seattle next week for a long weekend and I was hoping to get some tips from her as well as possibly get together for lunch or dinner.

<NAME/> to see you soon and please say, "Hi!" to everyone for me next weekend at the lake house.  I'm so sad I'll be missing it, but I'd already booked my flight by the time <NAME/> sent the email.

Hi <NAME/>,

I wanted to touch base with you regarding accommodations.  They last time I came to Seattle I used the following web-site and managed to get a very good deal on my hotel.  http://www.seattlesupersaver.com In the past, I've stayed at both the Westin and Mayflower which seem to be in fairly central locations downtown.  I wasn't sure if you would be making the reservations or if you would prefer that I handle that aspect.  You can either email me back or call me at the office if you would like to discuss any of this in more detail.  My work number is 713-853-1455.

Thank you,
<NAME/> <NAME/>

Just wanted to say, "thanks gals" for dinner last night.  To be honest with you I had had a pretty bad day and the rest of the week hadn't been much better, but I had a really good time last night....I forget sometimes how nice it is to share so many great memories with old friends.  Not to get too sappy, but I really treasure our friendships and I'm not sure you all realize how much i depend on you guys.  I know it's rarely overt, but I've leaned on the stability and solidness of our friendships on countless occasions and just don't know what I'd do without that safety net to trust in when things are rough.

Settlements and Risk have blessed our version of the procedures.    Now we need to run this by Teco.   
Should I call <NAME/> Busot to discuss,  or is this an item for discussion in the meeting on Tuesday?

We have already received their invoice for June and they have again invoiced us at the sales price, rather than the minimum market price.

I will be involving <NAME/> in the reconciliation to give him some exposure to this side.

What do you think?

These are my notes on flowing gas.  Tetco will be the problem pipeline.  I called my rep again and asked her to seriously look into it.  I'm thinking worse case is they will need either cash or a letter of credit for about $1,000,000.00.  I'm using the following formula

	MDQ (22,000 dth) x 20 days x $ some cashout price 

They may cut back on the number of days but the cashout price is the problem.  It's a moving target and I expect prices to go up.  I think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $1 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur, we could build our reputation on the pipeline, at least until we get rid of these deals.  If all the gas flows like it should, we should never have any actual expenses on any of these pipelines for the Keyspan deal.

Who knows what volumes are going to be?

I think this will do for now.  I was sniffling the other evening when we went out for a little drinky and Meredith said you wanted to work out instead of seeing me.  I was so sad and heartbroken.  Baby's doing good.  Woman has not had any problems so far and she's starting to feel the baby move on a regular basis now.  I've never felt the little sucker move - maybe she's just getting fat.  What do you think?

We keep loosing people.  <NAME/> is moving to the Estate Team power dispatch group.  Good for her.  That will make her in expendable.

back to reality with a vengeance, sometimes reality is no fun...I think the weekend in NB will prove beneficial for you as well so enjoy.  I'm guessing I'll end up at the party despite wanting to go to that concert at the Fabulous Satellite Lounge (I hate having a conscience!)  .

no contact with the guy...although i think he went home mid-week for a friend's wedding...regardless, though it may not sound like it, i haven't been too focused on the situation.  on a another "playing with fire" note, went and grabbed a couple pints wednesday with dutch (the old boss) and ended up eating dinner with him as well.  he paid (although he tricked me into letting him, said he was charging it to the company so i'd put my money away...needless to say he didn't expense it).  we've always been friends so i guess one outing doesn't hurt, but any future encounters may have to include others for safety reasons.

i'll see you when you get home.

Mariella,

You are much better at this than you think. Anytime you have an idea that you'd like me to consider or any questions, feel free to bring me into the loop. 

Did you notice in your e-mail that you now have an EnronOnline ID and Password? I can show you how to access it and find the quotes you need when you are ready.

<NAME/>

P.S. Have a great weekend!!!

Update:  ENA was buying daily swing gas from Sequent on Florida to supply the City of Tallahassee deal.  Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.  <NAME/> Goodell called <NAME/> Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier.  <NAME/> told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions, 
	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper
	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning
	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM.  <NAME/> will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.

Randy,

I hope all is well with you.  Hopefully, we will be starting up in the next weeks as UBS.

I don't know if you are still in the market for people.  I have attached the resume of <NAME/> Versen
for your review.  She was most recently responsible for trading physical gas in the Gulf.  She came out of 
our scheduling/logistics group and has extensive experience working on several East pipes.  I think she would 
consider a trading or scheduling position.

Sincerely,

Hey <NAME/>,

Here is the assigment letter that we talked about--the deals that they want to assign from Kaztex to Nicor Energy are the following:
V17258.1
V17337.1
V17515.1

They want these contracts assigned to Nicor effective October 1st.  From my perspective, is there anything else I need to do, other than change the name on our documents,once you have approved the assigment agreement.

Hey Guys,


I do not feel that the Heartland Steel/CSN issue is resolved.  We are now getting calls from a representative of CSN (Companhia Sidergica Nacional, LLC) saying that they have purchased Heartland Steel effective July, 2001.  If this is the case, then why are we continuing to invoice Heartland Steel?  Have we been paid by Heartland Steel?  Have we been continuing to receive the prepayments, and if so from whom?  Has CSN assumed the contractual obligations of Heartland Steel?

While the credit risk is not my responsibility, I am, however, extremely concerned that we really do not have a firm handle on the identity of our actual counterparty.

<NAME/> you please let me know how we should proceed.  I have a call into the CSN representative and it appears that they are not really happy with us, and would like to receive a visit from an <NAME/> representative.

Let me know what the game plan is by noon, Friday, September 28, 2001.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Just to clarify Britt's comments.  <NAME/> is using NNG's numbers for total imbalance.  To split the
	imbalance among the third party shippers, we will continue to use Oneok's allocation of actual

	ultra sonic measurement.   Thanks. <NAME/>

Hey Lis....

As always it's good to hear from you.  I've been meaning to write and ask what you think of the food there (although, obviously you are surviving).  Please tell Priya, "Congratulations!!!!" for me...that is awesome.  I was actually looking into that program the other day, so on a selfish note I'm really curious to see what she thinks of the school, etc.  I think it'd be awesome to work in D.C. (or Boston or Northern California for that matter).  You should definitely keep rolling with the momentum you've got going right now...run with it!  And, good luck trying to arrange the trip w/ Niclas.  If you do manage to go...just have fun (it doesn't have to be "it", it can just be fun).

I have an offer in KC right now, should be getting the formal offer from Cincinnati next week and still waiting to hear from Chicago.  So things are definitely happening.  I'm just struggling with this decision a bit and have a real tug to head to France or Switzerland for 6 months to become fluent in French (you think I'm kidding, but I've really been checking this stuff out).  

Part of the reason for my seemingly flaky turn is because of a recent sad event.  <NAME/> went into premature labor on Tuesday (she was about 6 mos along) and the baby didn't make it.  She had a heart beat when she was born, but it was very weak.  They tried to resuscitate her but after about 15 minutes <NAME/> and <NAME/> told the doctors to let her go.  Her name was Kelly <NAME/> <NAME/>.  My Mom and <NAME/>'s Mom flew out to TN on Tuesday and my Dad went out there Wednesday...they are managing, but it's been really tough.  <NAME/> is fine health-wise which we are all very thankful for, but everyone is really just trying to come to grips with why this happened.  So say a little prayer for them if you can.

I miss you too (you were actually in my dream last night) and really hope you're enjoying yourself.  Take care and I'll talk to you soon.

<NAME/>

When I look at my position manager for TP3 on 1st-4th, its short by 9189.  TCO is long by 9189 for the same time frame.

Part of the problem is deal 1016655.  I can see that the volumes on the deal for the 1st thru the 4th, but they don't show up in Unify.  These volumes also do not show up on my P&L.  My unaccounted volume on TP3 for September is (36,846  roughly 9189 x 4 days).

TRCO Team,  would you changed the pathed volume in Unify on this deal for the 1st thru the 4th by 1dt please?  I would like to see if that has an impact.

One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway. It just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.

He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw.

With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.  As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off!

Now, the Moral of the Story:
Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up.  Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!

Remember the five simple rules to be happy:
1. Free your heart from hatred.
2. Free your mind from worries.
3. Live simply.
4. Give more.
5. Expect less.

P.S.: The donkey later came back and kicked THE SHIT out of the bastard that tried burying him.

Moral: When you try to cover your ass, it always comes back to get you.

Hey <NAME/>,

I talked to <NAME/> yesterday and asked her for more time to make a decision.  I have basically until the end of the month to get back with them.  I'm still trying to check out the other opportunities that might be out there.

I spoke to <NAME/> on Tuesday a bit over the computer...things are weird.  He said everything was okay, but I don't think that's really the case.  He wouldn't respond yesterday.  Oh well....c'est la vie.

I'll talk to you soon and keep you updated,

As we discussed, EWS's documentation group is having a difficult time securing signed confirms for deals between EPMI/ENA and EES.  There are currently 361 physical confirmation letters outstanding with EES. Some of these have been outstanding since November  2000.  There are 24 financial confirmation letters outstanding with EES.  Some of these have been outstanding since March  2001.  The documentation group is under alot of pressure to secure signatures on all written confirms that are set up for signature.  Accordingly, it would be very helpful if you could help us resolve this situation. Please don't hesitate to call if we can be of any help.  Thanks in advance for your assistance.

I told you to ask Shemin "What the hell is going on with Dominion?  What's the latest?".  Well that's what this is.  Never got me an answer on that now did you?  I'm betting you and Shemin were at the Waffle House smokin'  cig's, drinking coffee, and eating hash browns that were "covered" with cheese and filled with "chunks" of ham

Shemin, how about an update on Dominion?  What's the word?

Gentlemen,

After discussion with <NAME/>, the Four Corners Units 4 and 5 are NOT take or pay.  This means that rather than selling from these units below the Lambda (unit cost is approximately $13), we should ramp them down.  They should still be the last units down (Copper off, then the steamer, then FC's). Because of restrictions on the units you may not be able to ramp the units all the way down all the time. Also, be sure to work closely with the dispatchers to ramp the units back up in a timely fashion. 
I apologize for misinformation on my part regarding these units.  If you have questions please see me, otherwise...spread the word.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

Hey team.  ENA should be wiring Reliant $25,000.00 today.

I will be out tomorrow and <NAME/> Sanchez (713-345-7791) will be backing me up.

<NAME/>, tomorrow morning, call <NAME/> Taylor (713-207-1482) by 9:00 AM and let him know if we are taking the gas or not.  If <NAME/> isn't there, ask for the person trading Florida.  Malory (don't know her last name or her number) has been backing <NAME/> up this week.  Reliant has the option of giving us the gas in Z2 or Z3 at a Z2 GD price.  <NAME/> will also let us take different volumes on different days over the weekend, even though it hasn't happened before.

Have a good weekend!

<NAME/>, 

For the Texas Desk, <NAME/> Olsen and I will start out handling the scheduling activities.  As we start up we will not be doing a lot of shipping on the intrastate pipes.  We will primarily be utilizing hub and cartwheel agreements and net outs.  Trading primarily on the Waha, <NAME/> , and Carthage hubs.  I will cover <NAME/> and Carthage.  <NAME/> will continue to cover Waha and any shipping activities on the intrastate pipes.  I will need a second person fairly soon after we begin trading again (within a month or two).  

What are you thinking that we need to look into on the intrastates?

Also, with message of setting up new budgets, can you have <NAME/> send me a copy of the budget we had in place for Texas 2002? 

Thanks.

<NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/>, we reviewed the attached recommendation and wanted to pass on
	an idea to you. On NNG, we are trying to ensure new or existing meters do NOT come on without
	a schedule volume to ensure proper billing.  Since TBS' on NNG do not always have a scheduled 
	volume tied to it, we may need to ensure the volume is covered at the Zone level by the shipper.  
	Do you think this is something the Measurement Desk could help the field with?  We certainly
	would be glad to help in any way on the scheduling side. This is especially important for new meters
	as we go through the billing process.  
	Just a thought.  Thanks. <NAME/>

Given the volatility in the gas market (which is the sole impact on the Canadian power book's US dollar exposure) and the exhorbitant cost involved in hedging multi-year cashflows (i.e. as evidenced by Friday 10/19/2001 trade of -$1,200,000 Cdn new deal value for the 14 year swap that I entered into), I will manage the currency exposure of this book myself, I will hedge appropriately when I see fit and will not accept hedges forced on <NAME/> Canada because of arbitrary position limits set by your department.

intercompany trades do not necessarily terminate upon bankruptcy - the parties don't have to perform but for valuation purposes the market positions are not terminated until notice is sent.  I've been talking to <NAME/> and others to help determine when we should get the trades officially terminated.  This issue needs to be addressed soon.

We have traditionally have had currency issues in Canada regarding P&L preservation versus cashflow preservation.

We have been valued in P&L under the US$ but due to Revenue Canada reasons our functional currency has been C$ (i.e.  the preponderence of cashflows were in C$ from the legacy gas deals, PetroCanada, Suncour, etc, and the PPA position).  Since trader evaluation at year end has been in US$, traders would hedge C$ positions immediately as the trade occured.  The hedge would extend until the position rolled of his book.  From a P&L systems point of view, this would preserve the trader's P&L in US$.  However, from a treasury point of view currency risk would still exist until cash exchange hands; these cash exchange dates were different for financial trades, physical trades and inter-company trades.  There was also some currency risk (albeit small) between billing dates from SAP and settlement dates of the respective trade type.

It is my opinion that the functional currency should match the evaluation currency in order to mitigate many of the above problems.  To a certain extent, I am indifferent if it is US$ or C$.

The timeline of the decision is being driven by our accounting group who need to set up the SAP system.  They are trying to work within a deadline to have the company capable of performing transactions by Jan 29.  This is the date that they have been told to meet by <NAME/>.  As a result, we would need a determinination of the functional currency by Mon Jan 28.

She has a mostly white one - at least those are the color of the kitty hairs on my clothes.  She left his front claws in because she said it was mean to take them out.  Of course she gets a little angry when he sharpens his claws on the couch.  I figure he will get run over by a car someday and she will be said - I will be sensitive and caring and then she'll get another one.

I guess I don't have to tell you that those long distance relationships are kinda tough.  Good luck.

In this case,    Ercot Asset gets allocated the expense of the imbalance.   The enpower deals listed below are under this desk.
The financial swap info is going out,  Frontera being the most logical first customer.

Is there anything else from us that you would want?   Im thinking in terms special entries that would notify your group to withold balancing expense from Frontera,  etc.

Let me know what you think.

Tomcat,

Sorry it's taken so long, but finally made contact with a guy at <NAME/> regarding your interest.  His name is <NAME/> Westbrock and he's the term ComEd trader.  I just forwarded your resume to him after speaking with him over the phone.  His e-mail is michael.westbrock@williams.com and his phone # is (918) 573-8752.  He said feel free to follow up with him directly later this week after he's had time to look into it.

Good luck,

They are forwarding the name and number of a financial/credit guy from Noresco as soon as they can.  They asked for a ball park and I could not help them.  Would it make a difference if we did 20 year index (for baseload) with gs daily for the swing?  Due to credit requirements from others we are competeing with on this, they are considering an index with the supplier with Noresco doing an internal financial swap with a sister company, perhaps Equitable.  
what do you think?  I will keep you posted on discussions.

Thanks!

<NAME/>
Attached is my worksheet showing our daily activity and prepayments.  I would like to send this worksheet to you 2 or 3 times a week.
Let me know if you agree with all the information.  We can also change the format.  I will be out of the office on Monday so Robin Barbe will be calling you.  Her number is 713-853-7177.

Also, we originally intended to wire more money to Reliant on Monday but we are trying to wire the money today due to the increase in prices.  I will keep you posted and I will update the schedule for any prepayments made today.

Long time - no email.  How are you?  As you know, things aren't so good here.  It is so sad!!!  Anyway, just wanted to put another bug in your ear - I'm still pro Atlanta.  If you know of anything going on at Mirant that would be a fit for me - please let me know.  West gas or power, origination or trading.  Give me a call sometime - I don't know how long I will be at this desk but my number here is 713-853-0685.  My cell is 713-412-4571.  That shouldn't change.  My email address at home is kward1@houston.rr.com.

I do hope all is well with you - and that you keep in touch no matter what!

Take care,

Hi Jordan,

<NAME/> called this morning to inquire about the status of the above referenced amendment.  I apologize for the delay on <NAME/>'s part in sending this document.  It is my understanding that this is the same document that would be used for the Dynegy guarantee as well.


Please send me a red-lined version of any changes you have and I will personally make sure that legal responds immediately.

We have two firm transportation agreements on Tennessee Pipeline.  The long term Boston Gas capacity release and a short term contract which expires on 1/31/2002.  The monthly demand charge on the short term capacity is $15,200.00.

Do we need to reject the short term capacity before it expires?  To my knowledge, we did not flow any gas on this contract for December or January.

Ex:  I've been buying gas from Reliant Energy Services, Inc. each month to serve one of my term markets.  According to Bjorn, the Credit Committee will no longer approve of my prepayments to Reliant for base load supply.

I sent you an update of the Hedge Summary for July 3, 2001.

In that I mentioned that I bought 125 MW of Cal02 at 10 HR flat.  I am long over 500 MW at this heat rate.  The biggest risk in this position is a large hydro year that
tanks the Mid-C (i.e. uncorrelated event with gas).  Mid-C off-peak is $47 USD, Nymex fixed price for Cal02 is $3.79 USD and Sumas basis is $0.16 for Cal02.  This implies a heat rate of close to 
11.9 for the off-peak Mid-C.

I am thinking about buying back some AECO gas hedge for Cal02, then selling Mid-C off-peak to replace the gas hedge.  Perhaps as winter blow-out protection, buy some Jan-Feb Sumas basis.  

The trade for a 25 MW long <NAME/> flat position would be:
			a) sell 25 MW of Mid-C off-peak
			b) buy 0.25 contracts /day of AECO fixed price Cal02 gas (i.e. to unwind the off-peak <NAME/> portion of the the gas hedge)
			c) buy 0.25 contracts/day of Sumas Jan-Feb basis

See what you think??

Hey Nella,

When I got in this morning, I had received an e-mail from Daddy on last Friday.  He said that everything was okay financially  for the future, and they only had an immediate need for the tax money.  He sounded okay with me asking about it.  He even said "You are so sweet with words".

He just doesn't realize, but we get that ability from him.

How was your weekend, mine was good, we spent alot of time outside.  We went to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendall love bowling.  In fact Jordan, ny athletic one, bowled a strike.  They call it bumper bowling because they put up little bumpers.  All the kids enjoyed it so much, <NAME/> and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl one day after we get off work.  Bowling alleys notoriously have good food.  Yesterday, we went to the park and spent several hours outside, it was like in the low 80's yesterday.  I'm glad daylight savings time is here, its so nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark.

This morning, I went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 6:30 a.m. (mind you, I'm running about 10  minutes late) and the daycare teacher (the wife of one of <NAME/>'s good friends) that opens up the facility (she's the only one with a key) was late again.  Now the heffa was late one day last week and I didn't say anything, beccause everyone is late every once in awhile, but she made me late for work last week.  So...I blew up this morning and had to leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 other parents with their kids.  I want to call up their and complain, but I think I'll talk with her first (maybe!)    She needs to get her stuff together, because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks.


Talk with you later

to work with all the Interconnect customers.  If customers are not in the position
to help and we have to go out of balance on Transwestern or Northern for operational
constraints, please leave myself, <NAME/> or <NAME/> and E:mail or telephone message

Bobby -
How's it going in PDX?     Things very different here in this "market."    It is difficult to trade against monopoly power.      Book currently melting down,  however,  things are turning around.       Here;   nuke goes down,  very hot weather............. prices tank.     The transmission is controlled by utility rednecks who load up the capacity,   driving up prices,  and they release the capacity in mid trading,  crushing the dailies.    We cant buy transmission and hold it in this manner.       Pig forkers!     
Anyway,  I havent been accepted into the bubba club yet,   but I'm still trying.    Presto and the other traders call my region "<NAME/> land,"  as most of the players are rednecks named <NAME/>.

<NAME/> the wife and <NAME/> are doing well.     Lot's of bad golf being played here!

I don't know why he agreed to see me because 30 min into the interview he said I wasn't what he was looking for.  He wants someone with contacts and cash trading experience.  He said he hopes to be looking for someone like me in about a year.  You just never know.  His number is 713-230-7205.

Group,
We are still short 50 mws in ST-WBOM on peak Friday and Saturday at $27.60.

For Friday only (as of right now) I have picked up 10 mws of energy flat (24hr schedule). I bought this energy from the APX-deal #840719 at $25. We will be long 10 mws each hour in position manager in SP-15 as a result. Please sell this energy in the off-peak (on-peak will go to fill our W-BOM short). I have scheduled an HA 24 purchase from the APX 1 and have put the energy into the ST-WBOM load zone. 

Do call with questions.

We can charge directly but still need some guidance.  For example, it is my understanding that there are 4 WO set up for Red <NAME/> - one for each station to be modified.  Our work is of a general nature, so do we have to further subdivide our charges to each of the stations, or to three of the stations.  Also, some of our time is spent on a general analysis of regulatory strategy involving all capital projects, and it seems like the overhead WO would be appropriate for these charges.  We don't necessarily want to have to have each person charge to 3 or 4 WO for each identifiable capital project and then to 10 or more WO for our general work.  Any specific suggestions, WO numbers, etc. ?

It was good to get your note.  To answer your question, I had my last (hopefully)

work on Tuesday, June 26th.  I was surprised I did not get postponed with the
flooding down in the Medical Center.  I stayed over one night and I was sure
ready to go home the next day.  I really felt for those nurses.  The hospital
(Diagnostic Hospital) was full to capacity since they were helping out the
Medthodist and <NAME/> hospitals.  

<NAME/> all your belongings in storage were OK.  I am so glad ya'll did not have
more damage than you did.  I talked to Ricki yesterday and she has people
starting to come in and redo the walls in her house this week.

I am so glad you told me about <NAME/> Klimesh's mom.  I had not heard about that.
Do you by chance have his address.  I would like to send him a card.  I had lunch

I liked the services portion of the night discussion note that you wrote on the 13th, but you need more information on sales on behalf of EPE for both HE 6 and HE 7...you need to explain any sales to marketers or utilities. I also need you to only sell to a marketer as last resort. A marketer is usually just flipping EPE's energy and is taking your spread. 

If you have any questions, just let me know. Otherwise keep up the good work!

I've would like to wire Reliant $9,500.00 tomorrow and then wire about $31,000.00 every Thursday to keep Reliant paid for 7 days of gas.  I'm making the following assumptions;
	1.  ENA will be maintaining this deal through March 31, 2002
	2.  Prices are going to remain flat for the next 2 months
	3.  Tallahassee will call on the maximum swing volumes every day

So far this month, Tallahassee has called on the maximum swing volumes every day.  I will make adjustments to the Thursday wire amount as needed based on prices and how much Tallahassee calls on.

The following worksheet projects how much we need to send Reliant each week and shows what days Tallahassee called on the swing gas.  <NAME/>, you mentioned adding a column for the sales price to Tallahassee.  Sounds good to me.  This file is located at o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/City of Tallahassee/Tallahassee Swing Cash Flow.xls

 

The following worksheet shows ENA's activity with Reliant, our current cash balance with Reliant, how much gas we have purchased, and what price we used.
I will send the following worksheet to Reliant each week.  I also plan to copy <NAME/>, Robin, and <NAME/>.  This file is located at o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/City of Tallahassee/ENA-Reliant Prepay.xls

 

<NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/>,   let me know what you think about the wire for Friday and every Thursday.

Here you go....<NAME/> wrote me an email and said she'd prefer to eat afterwards ( as would I ), so I say we plan to get to the "reception" around 7:00 and leave for dinner roughly 8:30.  Let me know if that works for you.

How difficult would it be to add the volume to the summary report we do today?

	<NAME/> and I met with <NAME/> and reviewed our process.  She felt very good about the process
	but would like to see the volumes impacted by the adjustments not just dollars.

	We can discuss when I get back next week.  

	Thanks. <NAME/>

I'm out Monday, Feb 11th.  I'm just cleaning up my apartment, getting ready for the big move.  My pager number is 877-498-5497 if anyone needs me or JUST WANTS TO TALK.  Do not leave a voicemail on my pager like <NAME/> does, I don't have the code to check voicemails.

Robin Barbe will talk to <NAME/> Taylor at Reliant on Monday.  <NAME/> Taylor's number is 713-207-1482.  We should have enough money at Reliant to cover purchases through Friday of next week.

Robin, <NAME/> will let you know if Tallahassee calls on the gas.

Attached is a draft copy of a Master Purchase/Sale Agreement  for physical natural gas transactions.  We are working on some of the information that <NAME/> sent us and will be in touch next week with some ideas.  It would be good for us to go ahead and get things rolling with this contract so we will be prepared to enter into transactions, whether they fall within the the realm of the management services agreement or not.

Please call me with any questions you might have.  My legal guys are standing by to assist, too.

Have a good weekend -

can you explain to me what data you are pulling for canadian fixed price positions in the report, it showed chris lambie selling 1200 contracts yesterday.   my records indicate chris sold 145 nymex contracts yesterday.  in general the data (i.e including the var calc) is questionable relative to my reports.

Jerry DeBerry called, and asked that <NAME/> call <NAME/> Evans to get a handle on the correct number for the wire transfer.  Once it is agreed, please send me an email with the revised number.

We were working off of different receipt dates.  I received the fax on Monday, and they believe it was delivered here the Friday before.  That is the reason for the different expectation on the closing date.

<NAME/> Duran would like to be advised before the transfer is made.  I presume that <NAME/> or <NAME/> will take care of talking to <NAME/> so that the transfer can be made tomorrow.

In the past someone at Bridgeline would call someone at ENA or vice versa to approve the deal ticket so that the deal terms would populate the accounting system.  Note: this would only happen with Brigdeline because it is and <NAME/> affiliate and because we are using the same trading systems.

Approving this ticket will give Bridgeline the ability to bill ENA.  I think there might be another way to do this without someone at ENA approving a ticket.  I'll see what I can do.

Hey <NAME/>,

Just wanted to check and see how you're doing these days.  I was offered a job with Cascade Natural Gas in Seattle this past week.  The salary is okay and the location is, of course, desirable but I'm just not completely sure about the job.  I have a while to make the decision.  They wanted an answer today, but I played hard-ball and told them I had to have more time (so silly, but it's very hard for me to do).  In the meantime, I'm exploring every contact I can come up with.  Anyways, you never got back to me and gave me any sort of idea about what your plans are post-school.  I'm very curious to know what you're thinking on that front.  Drop me a line when you get a chance.

hey...

thanks for the birthday wish.  i didn't end up doing anything too terribly exciting.  met some friends after work (the monthly dinner group) and then went to pappadeux with mom and grandma.  I had a kitchen shower/luncheon and a bar shower/party saturday in san antonio.  went out friday night with emily till about 2:30 am...perfect NW houston evening, donaraki (sp?) and Matthias's, got up saturday morning at 6am then drove to SA, out until about 3am saturday night, then up and in austin by 11am...brunch with corey then off to kathy and travis's, left austin around 7:30 and got home a little after 10pm...needless to say i'm exhausted today.

as for the job front....i was 1st runner up for the job with Puget.  they ended up offering it to a guy with more trading experience (go figure, someone with more than 1 yr of experience..ha), had he turned down the offer i would have been packing my bags but unfortunately for me he accepted.  as for ENE, i was offered a position with the new UBS trading organization but decided to decline the offer, i've come to the conclusion that i just need to make a clean break from this place.  i'm actually headed to seattle again this thursday to interview with another natural gas company up there.  it's a small company (around 450) and the job is for a scheduler not a trader, but i've got a good feeling about the place right now.  they strike me as nice people which seems to go a long way these days.  so, i'll arrive thursday evening, interview friday and fly back monday...they said they wanted to give me time to explore the city and look for housing etc., which is nice.

if all of this works out it looks as though i could be in seattle as early as march...WOW!

hope all is still going well with you.  i've been so happy to get your emails and know that this experience is turning out to be a good one for you.  

talk to you soon,
<NAME/>

btw....i got our deposit back from the apartment complex.  i'll just write you a check for your half and drop it off at your mom's house.

<NAME/>,  I'm following up the voicemail I left you this morning.
 
In our initial discussions you indicated we could do business under an existing GISB agreement between <NAME/> North America and Reliant.  However, our legal department believes all of our GISB contracts with Reliant have been cancelled/terminated.  Attached is a standard GISB agreement for your review.  I understand that you need to send this to your legal department to include any special provisions that may be necessary.   
 
Please call me at 713-853-4743 or <NAME/> Boyt at 713-345-7754 and let me know if Reliant Energy Services is willing to trade under this agreement.

Just a quick heads up for the flash.
Path 26 was derated last night for HE 19 through HE 24.  For HE 24 the price for congestion revenue was $247.98.  We were awarded 218 mws of congestion relief by the CAISO.  This should equal $54059.64 in congestion revenue to ECTRT. 
If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

<NAME/>,
I talked with <NAME/> at the Autohaus and he relayed that the car was in good shape,  but did probably need a valve adjustment,  as you relayed.   Maybe also an oil leak fixed.     Also,   I asked him about the oil light and he seemed to think that the oil sensor needed replacing.
The Porsche certainly requires more attention than most cars,  the clutch being a common and costly repair. 

The exterior of the car is in fair condition.     Maybe a detail shop could tell me whether some of the scratches could be buffed out.
I'm not sure if you have checked into painting while you had the car,  but you cant get it done inexpensively.

I am still interested in the car and I would like my wife to be able to take a look at it.     However,   I am leaving town tomorrow and wont be back until   Sunday.    Maybe we can meet then.   
If our discussions progress and you havent already sold or traded in the car,   I would like to have it checked out mechanically (at my cost)  and would like a detail shop to give me an assessment of what they could do with the finish.
I realize the car is not perfect and it is eleven years old,  but it is a large investment.....

Thanks,  <NAME/> for your time.

Hi, 

I need to look at the calendar again, but I think we will be leaving on Saturday the 9th of June.  We'll probably stop in Coffeyville for a day or so and come on through to Omaha.  

I'm sad to hear that Daddy's tube does not seem to be doing the job.  I had to hear that, because I too feel confident that if we can get some nourishment into his body that he will get alot better.  I'm so glad you stepped in and are taking matters into your own hands.  I also feel like Daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well.  I spoke with Mom yesterday, daddy was sleep, so she really got a chance to tell me how everything really is.  She too is now saying that Daddy is in pretty bad shape.

I asked Daddy about the retirement, and he said the same thing,  he is not ready yet. but the reality of it is, is that we still need to move now and not wait.  I just hope he understands.  I'm glad Daddy is not in alot of pain.  I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up.  It's so hard to face all of this uncertainty isn't it.  The good part, if there is any, is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering.  He's certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever, but if there is pain involved, I 'd rather see him out of pain.  Just keep praying for Daddy as well as Mom.  

If there is anything I can do from hear, just let me know.

Talk with you later!

FYI, 

	demand charge =  $2.6614 per month    = $.0875 per dth 
	and the commodity is			$.0136
	Fuel =  2.902 % and at $2.10 = 		$.0628

It appears as though the outside council opinion is no longer keeping us from completing the ISDA.  If you guys are ok with the current language, we can send you an executable copy and you guys can sign and send back with all of the documents that are required according to the ISDA.  We are prepared to provide you with our documents and will send them with the executable copies of the ISDA.

Call me when you get a chance and let me know what your status is.  I think <NAME/> and I will be in So. California the 17th and 18th.  If you have some time, we would like to stop by and see you guys.  Just let me know when you are available.

<NAME/>, 

The message below is in reference to the voice message and e-mail I sent you a couple of weeks ago.  We are serving as agent for Tenaska IV, with the duties of scheduling and settling for the fuel needs of the Cleburne plant.  In November, the plant was not running at full capacity, so we sold the excess fuel gas to TXU Fuel and TXU Gas Distribution.  In doing this, we ended up with a net payment owed to Tenaska IV (in normal months, Tenaska pays us and then we pay the suppliers and pipelines.  All profits/losses are passed through to Tenaska.  ENA receives a management fee).  Can we pay intercompany bills?  How should we go forward with this agency responsibility?

New VERY IMPORTANT deal.  I promised parent guarantee requirements and credit and collateral term probobly in the form of an Enfolio by Thursday.  This is a power generator that we do services for in Portland.  Tracy is very familiar with this company and has reviewed their credit.  She should have all the infor you need.  If not let me know.

customer:  Wheelabrator, a subsidiary of Waste Management.  

They need gas for their Lassen, California plant and HAVE to close something by next week.  I am showing them a basic structure with a baseload volume with swings being priced at gas daily.  9,000/day baseload @ Malin.  Today the fixed price is about $4.10

Is there anyway to get this done?  Please let me know so that i can pursue.  Also, can we do physical gas deals under the EEI?  We have an EEI with them.

THANKS,

<NAME/> Payne, <NAME/>'s boss at Transco is resigning for personal reasons.  That kind of came as a surprise to everyone over there.  They supposedly have a reorg thing going on over there too.  <NAME/>'t know if that's it or not.   The lease at the tower is up ?next year? I think.  The new CEO said staying in the tower is their first choice but they want to lease 20 floors instead of 40.  If that doesn't work, then they may move West to Beltway 8 somewhere.

Currently, we are unable to use IT to serve Ogy at <NAME/> on Transco.  I have devised a super scientific method for pricing VNG space for Ogy.  Poke all the holes in it you want.

Use the following formulas to determine the price to Ogy

The higher of

TCO Offer plus $.14

Good Luck

Hey stranger,

<NAME/>'t talked to you in while, how are things going?  The trip was absolutely incredible.  We went scuba diving, swam with stingrays and drank enough (rum for me personally) to drown a large school of fish.  

Anyway, I've decided I'm a no go for <NAME/> this Thursday night.  I'm already exhausted and Jen Bowles offered to drive Friday morning so I've decided to take her up on the offer.  After the Caymans last weekend, <NAME/>'s wedding this weekend and San <NAME/> next weekend I've decided my best move is to try and conserve some energy.  Regardless, I will see you and <NAME/> Saturday night and we'll do our catching up then.  My parents are coming to the wedding as well so I'm sure they'll want to have a nice chat with you and <NAME/>.

Talk to you soon,
<NAME/>

I don't know what to do.  Boss says I don't need to look for a job and they will have to find some $$ to keep people. don't know that I want to be among the 7000 enron employees beating the streets.   Any suggestions?  there have been no formal announcements of layoffs but Logically, I feel like about 50% of my friends here will loose their jobs.  Especially the ones not associated with gas or power.  The world is in turmoil!  Wish I had my sailboat and 6 mos. $$ to live on - I would go to the caribbean and stay for a while.

Hey girl,

What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really could have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I had a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and they had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at 6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating at 6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl, Ms Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top that I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I wore my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high heel sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.  When I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said "Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the husband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan take some pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile). 

We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, <NAME/> said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I was wondering where <NAME/> had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that she's back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we'll get a chance to visit tonight.  <NAME/> already said he wasn't going to be home until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change too.  Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much.  All we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different, independent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break and new environment.

Oh well, talk with you later!

Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!

They are supposed to give no less than 5 business days notice prior to closing.  The earliest notice I saw was Nov. 19.  I counted the 20th, 21st, 23, 26, closing on the 27th. (page 12 of the amended and restated LLC agreement).

Any luck on developing this tool?   Also,   tell me the status of the Esca people.   The hourly trading system is not complete and I understand that they are leaving.

Thanks for listening  on last week's phone call.       I have been asked to help <NAME/> <NAME/>-Smith get Ercot off of the ground as far as Services and Hourly trading is concerned.     If you have not  heard,   the Entergy and TVA cash trading positions will now be manned by one trader who will also trade the term markets.        This will give the traders the leverage needed to create value in these  respective regions.      My inexperience in the term  is the reason given for my implied demotion,   although these moves opened up cash trading opportunities for  other players.          This had been the first month that I've had  access to the prompt month and I am up nearly $500k;     there is no doubt in my mind that I was going to beat this region into a profitable proposition.

I have notified Presto that I would be joining <NAME/> in Ercot,   but would be considering other options in <NAME/>,  or even Portland.     I mentioned that I might call you and he has no problem with that.         The job in <NAME/> may be a good opportunity,  however,   the environment here is not compatible with my personal and professional  goals.

I am looking for other opportunities,  preferably within the company.     If there are areas that you think might be a good match for my skill set,  let me know -   I would appreciate your consideration or suggestions.       You certainly are under no obligation to do this,   but I am confident that my track record will generate some interest within the company,   possibly on the retail side.       

Thanks for your time,

J Forney

I just spoke with <NAME/> Vos.  She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers.  Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU.  There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity.  It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too.  We can chat about that next week.

Sabra, do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and <NAME/> is giving us the gas at?  I'd like to see that if possible.

<NAME/>,
 
Hello. How are you? What are you doing these days? I hope you are doing well. It has been a while to say the least, but the other day <NAME/> and I were talking about college and your name came up (oddly enough). I mentioned that I hadn't talked to you for over two years, and was curious what you were up to.  <NAME/> said he might have your old email address, so I asked for it and figured I would drop you a note.  I hope you don't mind.  

Anyway I am still living in Portland but I am no longer practicing metallurgical engineering.  I began trading power about a year and a half ago for <NAME/>.  I now manage the  west hourly power trading group. The job is great, very challenging and everchanging, though I don't believe my company is too popular down your way right now (you are in San <NAME/>, right?)...  

My job consumes my time, but I am still playing soccer and still riding that same loud red motorcycle around when I have a chance. I just bought my first home, its a condominium downtown next to the Portland <NAME/> Museum.  The place is definitely small but has a lot of character.  It was an old hotel, originally built in 1926, that has just been gutted and refurbished.  It is about eight blocks from my office at the World Trade Center, so walking to work in the mornings is great.  The city is still asleep and eerily quiet in the morning twilight when I walk to work.  The walk helps wake me up and gets me prepared for the morning rush on the trading floor.

So, if you have a chance drop me a line and let me know how you are. This email address of mine works (though everything on it is subject to subpoena by the good state of California), or you can give me a call at 503-887-3449. I'd love to hear from you and catch up a bit, as I often wonder what you are up to.

Take care.

<NAME/>

<NAME/> & Stacy,

I didn't which of you would have the most time to deal with this, but, I am responding to an RFP for provide gas to several Frito Lay plants in California for the term Dec, 2001 through October, 2003.  It will be a full-requirments transaction whereby we manage the imbalance and transportation.  Based on the request, they would like to execute a GISB with special provisions that I have attached.  I have also included a confirmation form they would like to use to confirm the transaction for each of their facilities.

ALL REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS TO THIS CONTRACT FORM MUST BE SUBMITTED WITH THE RFP RESPONSE which will be emailed to them by noon central time on Thursday, Nov. 15.  Sorry for the rush, I just received the RFP yesterday and didn't realize this was a stipulation until just now.  No modifications indicates that the proposed language is acceptable.

I am also attaching the RFP itself.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  this will be a pretty standard full-requirements offer.  Please let me know if you have any questions or what I can do to help.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

hey....just an fyi, we talked last night...conversation took less than 5 mins and i think somehow whatever i needed to hear was said, or not said if that makes any sense.  anyway, i'm definitely up for a drink tonight as well as shutting this door behind me and keeping an eye open for the next one ahead.

.....the guy actually said that he was "bummed"....that choice of words did wonders for me....i mean, you get bummed they don't make your favorite candy bar anymore or b/c you had a disappointing meal....it's just not enough that someone be "bummed" by the prospect of never being with me again.

I'm in a really sour mood.
I wish I wasn't so tired all of the time!
I don't think there is a minute in any day that I don't feel like I'm going to fall asleep.
It's the "pits"
I almost called last night around 10:00 pm to just talk, but I figured that I shouldn't bother anyone if I'm feeling sorry for myself.
I know I'm not real good at returning calls and following up on things.
My excuse is that I'm always exhausted
I feel like I must be doing something wrong since no one else seems to be like this.
I do appreciate your friendship, and regret everything you have to put up with!
 
ENE is down $1.42 right now!
No news that I know of?
The DOW is down (113) right now.
It appears that things may be escalating in Afghanistan.
I think the Special Forces are close.
 
Have fun at <NAME/> Hole!

Hey, <NAME/>.  We are in sad shape, aren't we?  I was on vacation last week, through Monday.  Not a good feeling coming back to a sub $20 stock price and an SEC inquiry.  It never really seemed possible to me that <NAME/> would be here.  Other than concerns for my future, everything is going fine.  Things really are ok, I know I can get a job with AEP if I need to.  I actually started talking to them about it.  But on Wednesday, they made a few changes that I'm not so sure about.  <NAME/> Gottlob (recently made VP) was put over the origination desk.  (I heard that they weren't too pleased with Ducoti and Bilberry.)  With that move, they needed someone else to run the trading desk.  That person is our fast-talking friend, Carey Metz.  That blew me away.  I believe their thought was that he would be the best to manage the financial risk.  Apparently he's made a ton of money since he's been in <NAME/>.  He's also going to stay in <NAME/> with this responsibility.  So, this may be the first move to bring the group up north with the rest of the family.

The home-life is going well.  We have 3 year-old soccer every Sat.  My lovely wife signed me up to be the coach.  I'm going to get her for that one.  It is fun, though.  Those kids are funny.  They don't care where the ball goes, they just keep kicking (even through the woods).  Looking forward to Halloween.  <NAME/> is going to be a policeman, <NAME/> is going to be a jailbird/prisoner.  <NAME/> has already handcuffed <NAME/> a number of times, he loves it.  My vacation last week was very good.  It was the first extended vacation that I have taken where we didn't have traveling and entertainment stuff planned.  It was one of the best vacations I have had.  We spent 2 days in San <NAME/> doing the zoo and easy stuff like that.  The rest of the week, we did things around here (like Children's Museum).

Big game coming up this weekend.  Do you think your Huskers can pull it off?  I think OU's going to win it, but it should be a great game.

How about the 6,7, or 8th for lunch?  Later.

Wanted to give everyone an update on the status of the new report format for the
morning meeting:

	The report is completed for all information except:

		<NAME/>
		Operational Capacity
		Current and Accum Imbalances

The group working on this feels they will have all pieces of information 
available and the report completed by June 15, 2001.  The above referenced
fields have been a challenge to get  the data base populated as needed.  But this
group has done an excellent job in striving to give us an accurate report and not
giving up on possibilities.

As you are aware, <NAME/> and <NAME/> have already started using the report
and we have changed how we report outages and allocations.  Storage will
change once the new report is completed.  

<NAME/> Powell and Dale Ratliff have been an excellent resource and very helpful to
ensure we get the product we need.  

If you have any other questions or any concerns about not getting the new
report before June 15th, please let me know.  Thanks. <NAME/>

Wow, I didn't know that you got flooded!  That's awful.  I hate to see that you and <NAME/> have deteriorated to that point, but if it is over you just have to keep your head up and move on.  If it was me, I think I would start looking for one of those Russian Mail Order brides.  It will cost you a plane ticket and some braces but you won't have to buy a boob job because they all have great tits!  You can't be getting fat.  Aren't you still running?  If not you need to start.  If not for your body do it for your mind.  It is the best thing for that!

Shubh,

The only publication that I have been getting is World Gas Intelligence published by Energy Intelligence Group. I can FAX you my latest copy if you are interested. Also, they have a web site:  www.energyintel.com

Poten & Partners' main number in New York is 212 230-2000. Also, there is a sample issue of LNG in World Markets at www.poten.com. I spoke with <NAME/> <NAME/> (Poten) and she says the lowest cost way for you to get the publication is to be added on to <NAME/> <NAME/>'s subscription for $500/year. <NAME/>'s number is 212 230-2086. The website also has the form that you need to fill out to get added on to <NAME/>'s subscription. 

Call me and we can look at the website together.

I am also anxious to get some news regarding the lenders' meeting in Singapore.

Take Care,

<NAME/>

Mr. Hinson,
Sorry I missed your call.      The Frontera Plant is composed of 2 CT's and and steamer.      Three units in total,  however,   the steamer cannot operate independently of the ct's.    I say this because the Ercot protocols allow dispatching each of these units independently and Ercot exercises this right while punishing us financially for non compliance.

There is no way under the Resource Plan from the protocols to express which combinations must be considered.       These units are behind a common point,  so the rules as they were written dont consider us.     

I know that this is more than you asked for,  but for whatever it's worth........


Thanks and give me a call if you need more info,

<NAME/> Patterson, our Rep,  called today to ask me if everything was resolved to my satisfaction.    I relayed that I did talk to <NAME/> Adams last night and he did agree to give us one hour notice with an OOME instruction.    This is great,  however,   <NAME/> warned me that we were outside of the tariff because Ercot still maintains that OOMC means run.
He relayed that in the event of line meltdown,  etc.  we would be liable.     <NAME/> Adams also said this last night.   We are officially on notice of potential QSE liability.

In my opinion we need to:
Call <NAME/> Saathoff and see if he can resolve their confusion today, otherwise we need to file whatever is necessary, under the protocols,  to protest this ridiculous interpretation and to protect ourself from this "liability."
Officially request clarification in the protocols on this issue.

On TW, TW allocated SoCal on the ID2 cycle for Sunday's gas day, due to SoCal non performance.
	We cut about 27,000 mmbtu.

	The Sequel 2000 conversion on the reports went well.  <NAME/>'s team was here to help Sunday morning
	and I believe that made things go smoother.  There were a few isolated situations which were turned
	around quickly.  

	Otherwise it was quiet on the pipes.  
	
	Thanks. <NAME/>

None as of yet...so are you just going to let the party people know tomorrow or what?...I figured from your last email you were a lock.  As for myself, I'm still  waiting to hear back from Corey about the concert, so I don't know what I'm doing yet either.  I would love to go to dinner with the crew and then transition to the concert but I don't think the times exactly work out.  Anything in the hopper for this evening?

Just a quick note on the information I've sent you.  The following two lines deal with the activity I've been involved in since Dec 2, 2001.  Some of my coworkers have said I should leave these lines out.  What do you think?

?	Buy and sale gas for the <NAME/> Estate Team.
?	Provide commercial evaluations on post-petition deals to legal counsel.

Also, I sit right in the middle of the pack so it is a little awkward to talk if everyone is here like they were yesterday.

Conversation:

Him:	yo

Him:	guess what
Me:	what
Him:	i'm an engaged man
Him:	that kind of came out of nowhere huh

There was about 15-20 more of conversation which we can discuss later, but needless to say I'm still reeling.

I am genuinely flattered that you are asking for my reading recommendations (not to mention being associated in any way, shape or form with <NAME/> - How is <NAME/> by the way?)  Truth be told, however, of late much of my reading material has been natural gas related and although the industry is riveting, I'm not sure that is exactly the kind of entertainment you had in mind.  However, I did read a book a few months ago that you might find rather interesting.  The title is The Professor and the Madman : A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary.  I know it may sound a little dry at first glance, but I actually found it extremely interesting.  If you go to Amazon.com there are reviews on all of the books I've included here.  There are also a couple of other books I'm in the process of reading right now:  Galileo's Daughter : A Historical Memoir of Science, <NAME/>, and Love and <NAME/> of Aquitaine : A Life.  The Galileo book is a little slow to start, but has tons of interesting historical references, as does <NAME/> of Aquitaine.  If I remember correctly, you always had a bit of a fondness for history.  I also read Memoirs of a Geisha last fall and couldn't put it down, although I have talked to others who didn't find it as enjoyable.  Personally, I was completely intrigued by the time period and uniqueness of Eastern culture, and the author was meticulous when it came to research for the book.
<NAME/> this helps you out a bit.  As for the "Peacers" comment...Definitely think we are tested, but I think the tests are there to force us to recognize our own strength and endurance.  Contrary to God not knowing anything about us, I'm convinced he knows everything about us and has the unique ability to know when we've lost sight of our talents, character and/or zest for life.  It is at these moments life seems to hand us the upsets right?  But, in dealing with the upsets we come to a better understanding of who we are and what we have to offer the world (or on a much smaller scale, what we have to offer the people around us for whom we care the most).  Sorry, I know I'm getting excessively deep, but I've been doing a heck of a lot of thinking lately - and much of it at church.
Disappointed you won't be able to join the gang in <NAME/> over the fourth, but we'll be sure to raise our glasses in a toast to you.  And, I'll keep looking for you name on the <NAME/> Field scoreboard.
Later,
<NAME/>

Please add it between Mapco and Red Cedar points.
Also please check to see if the Rio Puerco receipt and delivery are added
into the totals of the Central Area.  If they are in the total please exclude them.
Rio Puerco is a stand alone point.  Rio Puerco should still be added into the
total Transport Receipt and Delivery.
If you have questions please call.

Gene,

I have a methodology that gives me the answer with 3 uses of the balance 50% of the time but requires 4 uses of the balance the other 50% of the time.
Are you sure this can be done???? 

For my first use of the scales, I place a total of 6 balls on the scales (3 on each side). If they balance, then none of the six balls on the scales is the odd ball. If they do not balance, then none of the six balls that were left off of the scales is the odd ball. Thus, I have reduced the possible suspects to 6 after one use of the scales.

Is this the right starting point???

Second, I place three balls that have been eliminated as suspects on one side of the scales and three balls that are still possibles on the other. Two outcomes:

1. If the scales do not balance, I know that one of the three suspects on the scales is the odd ball and I know whether it is heavier or lighter than the others. I can determine which is the odd ball on the third use of the scales by placing only one remaining suspect on each side of the scales. If they balance, then the suspect left off is the odd ball. If they do not balance, I know which one is odd because I already know whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter.  

2. If the scales balance on my second use of the scales, then I have three remaining suspects (the balls left off the scales) but do not know whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter. I cannot figure out how to determine both the heavier/lighter question plus identify the odd ball in just one more use of the scales. I need two more uses. 

Am I close at all????


I hope that you had a good trip back. Stay in touch.

Maragaret,
I have 2 prepays in this email.  We will not need to wire money to Tennessee if we can get TXU set up as a supplier by 8:40 AM tomorrow.

Note to all
The first prepay is to TXU.  I'm requesting $22,500.00 to be prepaid to TXU - that's about 5 days of supply for the Tallahassee deal.

The second prepay is for 1 day of interruptible transportation on Tennessee.  If we are unable to purchase gas from TXU or Reliant, we will use the Bear Creek storage gas on Tennessee to supply the Tallahassee deal.  This is what we did on the 2nd-6th.  I am also anticipating that the discounted IT rate on Tennessee will be higher for gas flow on the 7th.

My goal is to maintain 2 active suppliers (with prepays) on the East Coast, TXU and Reliant.  I would also like to set up a trading contract with another supplier (maybe Coral) in case TXU or Reliant decides to stop doing business with ENA.  Our supplier for the swing gas on the Tallahassee deal in January was Sequent.  However, last Thursday, Sequent stopped doing business with ENA because it was too much of a burden for them to keep track of the ENA prepays and the daily volumes.  So far we have spent 3 business days trying to secure another supplier.  We will also be able to use TXU and Reliant as suppliers for any other deals that we are able to start up.

Regarding the GISB,  issues remaining are Section 3.2 Performance Obl. and their Guaranty.

We prefer Spot Standard for Section 3.2 however, they argue the Cilco city gate does not have a "Spot Market" .  If the city gate is their end user I will give on this point.  <NAME/> is checking on this.  The only other issue is their Guaranty to <NAME/>.  I have no problem with amending the gty or putting a new one in place.  Having said that, I would prefer they draft the amendment.  This of course is contingent on credits ok with the change in the gty amount.

FYI, I will be out to the office tomorrow afternoon for meetings. If you need me leave a message with my assistant and I will call you back.

They can't even manage to bury their bad trades in 35,000 mws of load!
Humorous article though.

To EPLF and its sympathizers:   Unless the toaster is returned immediately, SADIST will commence an escalating series of  actions designed to bring all such terrorists to their knees.  We realize there may be some collateral damage, and for this we are truly sorry.  But we must end toaster terror forever.  Beginning at 0900 hours on 10 January 2002, SADIST will commence the following series of actions (each subsequent action will commence 2 hours after the preceeding sanction):
1. All deliveries of new business cards will be suspended
2. Napkins and paper towels will be removed from the kitchens
3. Post-it notes will be confiscated from all locations
4. Paper towels will be removed from all bathrooms
5. Toilet paper will be removed from all bathrooms ( <NAME/> stock certificates will be issued for humanitarian reasons)

If the toaster still has not been returned, SADIST will be forced to remove all COFFEE FILTERS from the building, including the Energizer and Plaza Java.  Do not doubt our will to use this ultimate weapon, after all we are SADIST.

We currently have 2 park & loan deals with Colubia Gas.

Deal 1) we have 310,000 that was scheduled to come out in December, contract #67401, we are currently paying $8370.00 per month on this deal.

Deal 2) we have 310,000 scheduled to come out in January 2002, contract #70457, we are currently paying $16,740.00 per month.

I have not spoken to the pipeline but I believe we would have to prepay all of our transport demand charge expenses before CGAS will let us schedule any of this gas.  Our monthly demand charge expense is $290,000.00.  I would also assume that we would have to prepay the EES demand charges as well.

Hi Gene,

As promised, here are estimated historical pricing for deliveries at the Nipsco city gate.  These prices are by no means, what we specifically charged at the time, but should give you an idea if this pricing is more competitive than the prices you have received in the past.  These prices also assume that you purchased gas at the First of the Month Index.  Please keep in mind that these sales prices are for deliveries to the Nipsco City gate, and you will need to find out what Nipsco will charge you to transport the gas from the city gate to your burner tip.  If my memory serves me, I believe you indicated that you were buying your gas directly from Nipsco, and if that is the case, then we will be comparing "apples to apples".

January, 2001			$10.99

February, 2001			$  6.61

Mar, 2001			$  5.38

Apr. 2001			$  5.70

May, 2001			$  5.13

June, 2001			$  3.95

July, 2001			$  3.40

August, 2001			$  3.25

September, 2001		$  2.42

October, 2001			$  2.00


I still need to find out from you what type of volume you will need on a daily basis.  Please call me at 713-853-5772 once you have had a chance to review the information and let me know your thoughts.

Mom must be at it again....

career meter:
You find out late this week that your suspicions were right on. You've known for some time that a particular person didn't have your best interests at heart, and this week's revelations confirm your suspicions. It may be time to take flight and move in a different, more fulfilling direction.

love meter:
You feel more sure-footed and in control of your private life by the end of the week, mainly because the uncertainty that has hung over you like shroud finally lifts. It's liberating knowing where you stand.
weekly horoscope:
For February 4-10: A loved one may make a momentous choice, once Saturn and Mercury move direct. This could happen as early as this weekend, but may take longer. The point is that your life, circumstances, and opportunities are finally able to break from free the ice. Welcome change as the liberating thing it truly is. <NAME/>'t be afraid. For some time, you've known things were not right -- and something had to give. Be very cautious about who you confide in. At this point, the walls have ears. As you establish a new chapter in your life, play your cards very close to your vest. 
Thought you might enjoy.....

This is what I want to send to our "Team".  Would you please do a quick review just before I send it out?


These are my notes on the Sonat Park & Loan.  I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA.

Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.

ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing and additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002.



<NAME/>'s notes:
Sonat Park & Loans

2/19/02  History  - Per <NAME/> Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to <NAME/>, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before <NAME/> declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is <NAME/> <NAME/> (205-325-7696).  I left a message for <NAME/> to call me.

<NAME/> <NAME/> returned my call.  <NAME/> said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked <NAME/> if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply.  <NAME/> said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

Good morning.
We are off in position manager at Mid Columbia because of <NAME/> Canada. I notified <NAME/> at <NAME/> Canada at approximately 6:15 this morning. Position manager is also not working properly, it is reporting a variance at Pacificorp system border ? and at Palo Verde. However the position manager shows no variance when detail is clicked.
If you have questions, let me know.

What's Happening?


How's it going?  I will not be at rehearsal tonight because I'm going to get my hair done.  I figured that you all will be practicing (is that how you spell practice) your <NAME/> songs and I will be in Omaha for <NAME/> so I don't need to learn the songs, as we only sing them on <NAME/> anyway.  Besides, just in case you didn't hear, we don't sing this Sunday (We switch with the kids), since you all will sing on <NAME/> for all 4 services.

This daylight savings time is nice.  It's so nice to be able to get home and still habe daylight instead of feeling like you whole day is shot once it gets dark.

Did you find any houses that you liked?  How long were you out?

Talk with you later!

Group,

Cuts are on the way. While most can be zeroed out in Enpower (for LD's) like normal, longterm contracts will require an annuity for the value of the cut on that particular day. In the interest of being uniform, the guidelines for cuts are below. 

We will be handling cuts in the following manner:

1. Documentation is priority #1. We need to fill out a cut sheet with the times, the name of the person who called, the tag number, the quantity and price.

2. After attempting to resupply the cut or find an alternate sink we need to carefully document changes in the new enpower workspace.

3. We need to zero out all cut deals in Enpower, we then need to calculate the value of the deals and make an annuity. The annuity must be made HE 1 on the following day of the schedule. The annuity needs to be for 1 mw for the value of the zeroed out contract. In the comment section of the annuity you must include the Enpower deal # of the cut deal and should include an indication of the number of mws each hour and the contract price--for example (4 hours @ 25 mws X $100 per mw = $10,000).

4. Please be as accurate as possible. We still need to be flat in Enpower at the end of each day. And we still need to calculate our daily position.

5. Put all cut sheets in the accordion folder on <NAME/> Symes' Desk.

I appreciate your help and diligence.
Thanks,

<NAME/>

Here are my cryptic notes from the PEPL class:

The field area of PEPL is considered to be everything upstream of <NAME/>

<NAME/> is considered to be the demarcation between Field and Market area on PEPL

PEPL mainline divided into 100 mile marker segments

Two legs in the field area---Liberal and Seiling and/or Elk City (named after the Elk City Plant)

Liberal historically has been a constrained area, but has seen alot of non-constraints as of the last couple of years due to the strength in the West, as well as production declines in the area

For anyone trading PEPL cash, etc, it is important to watch the spreads b/t Rockies,  CIG, TW and PEPL--for instance the variable rate to move CIG into PEPL is roughly nine cents.  The fuel is 2.67%

Another big point that frequently gets constrained is CIG Lakin--point flows roughly around 175,000 MMBtu/d


Field Storage - there are actually two storage facilities in the PEPL field area, although PEPL considers field storage to be at <NAME/>, <NAME/> is traded as a field point

Greensburg off of NNG is another major supply area on PEPL--called Mullinville on the NNG side, it is called bi-directional, but most likely can be done by displacement only

Tuscola - is the interconnect between Trunkline/PEPL interconnect

Lebanon - often constrained

Also talked about not being able to drop off at multiple delivery points on PEPL--unlike ML7

Hey team!!  I'm back.

And while I was gone it looks like our cash balance with Reliant is $228,419.05, which is due to ENA selling Reliant the gas back on Trunkline from the 14th through the 20th.

<NAME/>, I've updated my schedule for the gas flows on Florida.  Tallahassee sent me a schedule of what they show.  I'l like to compare that to what you have.

Hey Lady,

I just asked "<NAME/>" about you the other day.  I hear you two have been shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are doing great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good.  I'm very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little "stinky".

Who is <NAME/> or do you mean <NAME/>?  I may have her number at home, I'll call you if I do, or just call her for you.

Talk with you later!!!

FYI.  Wanted to pass on this information.  After working with Minnegasco to help them
	use Park and Ride as much as possible (considering we were allocating storage), the
	Minnegasco scheduler went into the system for Friday's gas day and changed their business
	between Intraday 1 and Intraday 2.  This caused cuts through Demarc and Mid 17.  We 
	tried to help as much as possible and keep the same rules we have with all other shippers.
	If you have any questions, please let me know.   Thanks. <NAME/>

Hey,

Just remembered that Cory Morrow is playing at the Firehouse Friday night and <NAME/> Temple is going to be at the Mucky Duck.  If you have any interest in doing something Friday let me know.  Maybe we could grab dinner and go see one of these guys play.  I figure you'll be shopping and jaunting around town all day Saturday with Mom, and Sunday is Mother's day...so Friday seems like the best day to get together.  Either email me when you get a chance or just give me a call sometime this week and let me know if any of this sounds good to you.

Lou,

Sorry I am just now getting back to you but I have been on vacation.  Anyway, the answer to your questions is $.70 today.  That number can change with the market though.  Keep me posted on any potential gas transactions you have going on and let me know if you need any price indications.

OK, here is what I have:

		For Wednesday, September 12 - <NAME/> and <NAME/> (2 tickets)
		For Thursday, September 13 - <NAME/> and Texaco (4 tickets)

	<NAME/> I am assuming you only wanted 2 tickets.  If that is not correct let me
	know and we can give one of you the 12th and the other a later game.

	Thanks. <NAME/>

As you requested  attached is language EPMI/ENA currently uses for index based power deals at various delivery points.  This language forms the basis for what is inserted into physical and financial confirmations for power index-based deals.  The underlying confirmations may also contain conforming language depending upon the delivery point and the counterparty.  This language is updated/revised periodically as indexes change, new information becomes available and/or to fit the agreed upon transaction.

Wow - I think the world is coming to an end.  All these huge changes.  Not much going on over here - doing busines as usual - don't htink I will see a change for a few months, if at all.  Maybe just some new faces - I think that there will be some hostility and not really looking forward to that part.  Moved onto the new trading floor this morning - chaos!  But very nice.  Unfortuneately, you know who is on my floor - bummer!  Anyway, as for <NAME/> - she was with EES on a product development project.  She worked with Corporate development on the Dynegy transaction and has been asked to stay on with Corp Dev to sell more asset through march or april.  At least this way, she knows she is employed until then.  She wasn't so sure about the EES gig and I think she is right.  My parents were going to come here for Thanksgiving but my mother has this "feeling" that they shouldn't make the trip - so they aren't coming.  <NAME/>'t know for sure what I will do but I refuse to sit at home entertaining myself for 4 days - I am sick of hanging out with myself!!!  You are probobly going somewhere warmer and perhaps tropical?  I hope you have a great thanksgiving!  Lets get a beer after - its the holiday season and time for (good) cheer!

<NAME/>,

I did leave you a voice message.  The Commodity price right now is $2.55 with a $.03 premium to schedule out of the basin and a $.05 premium to schedule the delivered volumes at the delivery point.  Also, in order to be allowed to schedule for you, we will have to get an agency agreement in place with El Paso, which could take some time.  In the case we don't get it in place to schedule for you Aug 1st, you could request El Paso to put your nom in daily until we get the agreement executed and in place.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

An update on our change for the Storage Allocation.  Several questions
have come up over the weekend.  The weekend crew is documenting the
questions.  I have left <NAME/> Bodnar and <NAME/> Buchanan a phone mail message
to research the questions and concerns on Monday.  Then we will group with
storage and determine what changes need to be made.

One change we talked about on the Sunday morning call with storage is to
be able to use SBS on the non allocated portion of storage.  ie, if we are
allocating injections, then withdrawals should still use SBS.  If we are allocating
withdrawals, then injections should still have access to SBS.  <NAME/> Bodnar will
pursue this enhancement further.  Thanks. <NAME/>

<NAME/>,
From an information standpoint this looks good. I would recommend using an appendix for the WSCC members, the FERC ruling, the NERC glossary and any other lengthy terms or charts. You might look to organize the paper from a broad overview of the electrical market in the west (including basic descriptions, timelines, fundamentals, etc.) down to a specific description of what you did at <NAME/>. The content of the paper looks good and I am comfortable with you submitting what you have.
If you need any thing else regarding your paper just let me know.
 
Thanks,

And I do appreciate the job offer, its just hard to do with a family.  But I will chat with my significant other and see what she says.  I've asked her about moving before and I thought she was going to hit me.

I just reviewed a vacation report that covers vacation up through 8/15/01.

	There are still a lot of people with a large amount of vacation.  I made an assumption
	everyone is carrying over 40 hours (which is the max) to 2002.  There was still a lot
	of vacation to be taken.

	I would like to meet with a member from each team Friday, September 14, at 2:00

I am attaching a spreadsheet that details what should be booked and billed to Citizens under the NEW gas daily call option/transport deal to serve the Griffith plant.  It is somewhat complicated but don't be scared - I will help both of you understand what needs to be done.  Hopefully, we can set up a procedure whereby this deal can be taken care of each month.

I think we should set up a meeting to discuss.  Let me know when you guys are available - hopefully sometime monday.

Guess what?  The house is unsured through July 21st or 24th or something like that.  I went digging through the papers last night and found it.  Guess who the Goober was that paid it last year???? me.

What I don't have are papers on the Silver Leaf resort thingy.  I mean I don't have a stitch.  That's ok - I mailed them a letter yesterday.  I'm going to try to get a gazillion bucks for it and leave you guys high and dry!   Whoooo hooo - Brazil (because of the ladies) here I come!!!!!!!!!!

Movies I want to see - Swordfish (<NAME/> Travolta), The Mummy II, and a new Jet Li (kung fu dude) movie.

I'm still looking for a bay boat fella's - about 17-19 ft long with a 70-115hp motor.  I'm willing to spend up to $6,000.00.

I don't know if I should call this the Ponderosa Pine plant, the Cleburne Plant, or what.  Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne.

Sabra, Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future.  

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow.  I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far.  Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this.  But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should.  I believe <NAME/> Voss's (on 3 in <NAME/> Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need.  I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this?  Let me know.  If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify?  I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy.  Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee.  Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

thx

<NAME/>, Drew, I am requesting the payment to be made on Monday, June 17th.

Same thing as yesterday.  I requested a wire in the amount of 244.20 (2000 dth x $.1221 per dth) which is for gas flow on ENA's IT contract #2891 on 2/6/02.  I negotiated this deal with <NAME/> in the bid room.  You should have received this yesterday afternoon.

<NAME/>, thank you for the update.  My only concern now is the file <NAME/>
sent us last night took 13 hours to load (I am not sure it ever loaded).
I know <NAME/> is diligently working on this, hopefully he can get this fixed
this weekend.  <NAME/> has a call into <NAME/> to see if we need someone available
this weekend to help test.  Thanks again for your support and follow up.

I think I may have just committed (by omission) my first (and may be only for this season's) fatal error - I forgot to get ranked and have never been ranked before. I don't know the  rules but I would assume until I get ranked I wouldn't be able to play.  I will try to get ranked ASAP but in the meanwhile.... do you know what the rules require.   I am so sorry if this is causing any problems.   Thanks

I think some relaxation time is definitely in order for you...so don't worry about tomorrow.  If you're in we can just try and buy tickets there, and if you're out I'll go to the bachelorette party...easy peasy.  Considering you start this whole ride over again on Monday, I would totally understand you wanting to bail out. Whatever you decide PLEASE do not worry about me...I am the epitome of flexible these days.

The attached spreadsheet allows you to easily calculate Eco's year-end LNG inventory for a variety of cases that vary dispatch rate, # days of outage for CT1, and number of cargoes diverted between now and year-end. Simply enter your assumption for number of days of CT1 outage in cell A16 and the number of cargoes you want to divert in cell A23. The year-end inventory is automatically calculated. A negative number means that you require more LNG than you are entitled to receive.

Assuming that you want the LNG tank full at year-end:

1. Eco will be able to receive 100% of the remaining 6 cargoes if the CT1 outage is 60 days or less

2. 175 days of CT1 outage are required to result in Eco being able to divert 1 cargo and still have a full tank at year-end

3. a 60-175 day outage for CT1 results in surplus LNG but whether or not it is enough to market depends on how much the outage exceeds 60 days

The above figures assume a 76% dispatch and 95% availability on days that Eco is not assumed to be in an outage.

At the risk of asking a stupid question, are we in breach under the project agreement?  I didn't comb it, but I also didn't see anything that screamed breach to me.  If we have a paid up call on 100 MW, that is probably something we would want to preserve.

More to consider!

I believe our new Tennessee rep is <NAME/> Glazebrook at 832-676-2635.  If she's no longer there then call <NAME/> Armstrong in the bid room and he will find out who our rep is.  His number is 832-676-5120.  Anyone that answers the phone in the bid room should be able to tell us how our rep is.

Our rep at Iroquois is Robin Zaleski at 203-925-7274.

<NAME/>, it was good to visit with you yesterday.  Here are the questions and answers that we promised you 
	at the conference call on Tuesday, November 6.  Please review and let <NAME/> or I know if you need any clarification.

	1.  What fields can be changed on a nomination and the nomination still keep its flowing gas rights from the previous cycle?

		Answer - (1) QUANTITY volume equal to scheduled amount or volume lower than scheduled amount
			  (2) RANK changed to a different number

	2.  Where can I find information on Imbalance Tiering in relation to mandatory monthly cash out?

		Answer - Tariff Sheet 268, D & E 

	3.  What points are in the grouping to determine a demarc allocation?

		Answer - <NAME/> (Trailblazer) and demarc are the only two points in the group

	4.  If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is allocated, can <NAME/> Power
	     switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and keep their gas flowing?

		Answer - The field Receipt to demarc deffered delivery IS included in a demarc allocation
			  because the transport tied to this storage nomination is physically coming from
		              the field to the market area. (<NAME/> we may not have been clear on this comment
			  on the conference call)

In the midst of the worst company crisis ever, when they have a chance to ask important questions, they ask the stupidest most irrelevant questions in the history of mankind!
I have concluded that the Employees deserve what they have gotten!!!

I would like to use the following for the Flexible Pricing.   The last sentence  regarding the keep whole verbiage I think you will want to delete this as it does not allow for Force Majeure.

 FLEXIBLE PRICING: During the Period of Delivery for a Transaction, Customer may request a price other than the original Contract Price, being a Fixed Price or (each below defined) by contacting Company during Pricing Hours requesting any such price for a specified quantity of Gas to be Scheduled during selected Months within the Period of Delivery; provided, such request must be made prior to 12:00 noon C.T. of the last Business Day prior to the last trading Day of the NYMEX Gas futures contract for the selected Month.  A Confirmation may be sent by Company to Customer confirming the Flexible Pricing agreement in accordance with Exhibit "A" "Fixed Price" means a fixed dollar amount agreed to by the Parties.  The price for all Gas for which a Flexible Price has not been agreed by the Parties shall be the original Contract Price applicable to the Transaction.  "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Confirmation or the GTC, upon Customer's acceptance of Fixed Price, Customer shall keep whole and hold Company harmless for all cost and expenses incurred by Company with respect to the quantity of Gas that is converted into a Fixed Price, in the event that such quantity of Gas is not Scheduled by Customer for any reasons, including without limitation events of Force Majeure.

For the Section "Daily Pricing for Physical for Physical Call Option" 

Daily Pricing means the "Daily Midpoint" price set forth in Gas Daily
 Platts, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, or successor publication, in the column "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to the geographic location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point(s) for the relevant gas day.  If there is no single "Daily Midpoint" price published for that particular Gas Day, but there is published a "Common" range of prices under the above column and listing, then the Spot Price shall be the average of such "Common" high and low prices.  In the event that no 'Daily Midpoint" price or "Common" range of prices is published for that particular Gas Day, then the Spot Price shall be the average of the following: the price (determined as stated above) for each of the first Gas Day immediately preceding and following the Gas Day in which the default occurred for which a Spot Price can be determined.

Let  me know what you think.

Sorry it's taken me so long to respond regarding the party Saturday (<NAME/> and I only got back into town a couple days ago from visiting <NAME/> in London).  I had actually already purchased concert tickets for Saturday night, but am currently seeing if I can find anyone willing to buy them from me.

500168 is a Bi-directional point and physically can flow both ways.  One Oak built a new delivery point with the capacity of 200,000
           and the other point that was a delivery only is still active.  The two I/C's go into different pressures into their system but physically
           located in the same yard.  TW, along with Marketing (<NAME/> Hyatt) asked to keep the same POI and asked to set this point
           up as a summation meter to make it easier for the customers to nom on both pipes.  <NAME/> was involved in this point.
56943 is only a delivery only and is good for only displacement.
1635 is no longer a bi-directional point according to <NAME/> Fernandes on the Monahans team it is a delivery to NNG only.  He will
        send an e:mail.
The Burlington Jackrabbit I/C in San <NAME/>:  That was Burlington's Plant and I/C.  They were the only shippers able to use that 
       point.  They are not using that point and they will get back with me and let us know if they want us to keep the point in active
       status.

Randy, what did this mean to shippers nominating on NNG's pipe?  Do they
have to change their location or POI number for nomination purposes?  If so,
how did we communicate to the shippers.  How does this effect OBA's?

Just got an email regarding our trip to the Caribbean in Jan - more guys have signed up that women!  You should definitely think about it - especially since there is such a large group of us.  (protection in numbers)  There tends to be lots of drinking though - but a very laid back and relaxing time hanging out on beautiful beaches! 

Glad to hear you had a good weekend.  I was sick with a cold/sinus infection the entire weekend - stayed home alone - am sick of myself!  Is Caraba's still the place of choice tonight?  Just let me know what time.

If you pull the Curves up under Pub Names you should be able to tell if the have any Omicrons attached to them on the Erms side...if the do, then you have to talk to Nilay Basu to make sure they are mapped on the Germs side...if they don't, then you'll have to attach an omicron and then speak with Nilay.

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

Are you guys aware of any storage?  I'm going to call Joe Parks later and see if he was working on anything related to storage other then Centana.  I also have a contact at  Lone Star that I could ask but I rather see if what we know form the inside first.

Our plans are to continue to use <NAME/> as long as we are authorized to do so.  We recently sent a justification for keeping her indefinitely, but, as yet, have not heard anything back.  I can not give an end date because I have no plans to end the arrangement.  If we are forced to terminate this arrangement with <NAME/>, we would have to add at least 1 full time position and the quality of our service would suffer greatly.  Please advise <NAME/> Kilmer and myself of the steps we need to take to continue to use <NAME/> indefinitely.  Her assignment is not related to a specific project but is to provide ongoing regulatory support to the Transwestern pipeline.

so this was my quote of the day.....

Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could
be. -<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/>, writer and philosopher (1803-1882)


wow, huh?

anyway, got your email with the articles for wahso...going to read them right now.  looks like i may be moving tomorrow, so i'll let you know what the future holds for me when i have a better idea. 

more importantly, i wanted to tell you how proud i am of you.  not only for striking out to park city on your own, but also for making the impression you obviously have on the people with whom you work.  it's often hard to see when you are the person in question, but i can tell you from my perspective that the people you work & associate with think very highly of you.  and, i'm thrilled that windy ridge vocalized their appreciation of you and your skills...definitely something you deserved to hear.  it is a great gift to be a person others have confidence in and want to be around, and those are qualities that you possess without question. 

driving into work this morning my sister called on the cell phone, said she had a special message for me...then mack and sally got on the phone and they sang happy birthday to me...i'm such a sap i couldn't help but to start tearing-up.  after they hung up i took a moment to examine where i am in my life right now, and i'm happy to report that i am pleased.  i tried to imagine my emotions had i decided to stay on w/ the group and i don't think my optimism would be nearly so great.  my point is this, sometimes not knowing exactly what the future holds frees you to imagine and dream of things you normally wouldn't.  so to you i say, the sky is the limit....dream, imagine, explore.  we are both going to do great things in and with our lives.  but what i think we need to realize is the scale of those things may be smaller (or even grander) than we'd imagined...point being,  we just need to try and be aware of those opportunities which come along every day that afford us those great moments be they large or small.

cheers!

<NAME/> FYI - I told <NAME/> that I would go with Bridgeline's number because 
1.  it is more conservative
2.  the difference is small
3.  that some trader may not have put in a deal or volume management didn't path the deals correctly....anything is possible with the turnover we have had.

If you have reconciled the numbers and know where the difference is let me know.

Hey Em,

<NAME/> the parental visit is going well and that you haven't lost your mind yet.  I just wanted to drop you a line to share with you my latest little upset (aside from getting physically ill at Teala's Friday night...it was ugly).  <NAME/> emailed yesterday and said he wanted to call and catch up.  When he finally did call I knew within the first minute why he felt the need to call, the engagement is OFF.  They evidently decided to postpone about two weeks ago and the final blow came Friday night.  To top everything off, he's moving back to <NAME/> in three weeks...ughh.  Obviously, given my last conversation with him in London, I'm a little concerned.  Oh well, who wants a non-stressful existence anyway.

Ta for now,

Hey <NAME/>.  Well, I'm still here for now.  It's hard to leave.  We have all taken quite a bit of time off (out all last week and a couple of days the week before that.)  I'll only be here a couple of hours today.  But we had a great Christmas.  The kids have been so excited.  I made the mistake of getting a couple of microphones/sirens for their tricycles.  You can hear them all through our neighborhood.  The neighbors have already asked my what I was thinking.  <NAME/> wanted 3 things (a play airport, a pirate ship, and Buzz Lightyear).  He got them all.  With each present, he kept getting louder and more excited.  <NAME/> was primarily interested in in opening presents, he didn't care what was in them.  That kid gets more out of ripping things up and tearing things down than any kid I have ever seen.  In fact, the other day, <NAME/> and I were stacking his big leggo blocks as high as we could go.  <NAME/> likes to make things and he likes them neat and orderly.  So, he was working hard at making this tower stand up and work (it ended up being about eight feet tall).  Well <NAME/> was chomping at the bit to run through it.  After holding him off for a few minutes, I let him go.  You should have seen his eyes light up.  You would have thought it was the biggest event of the year.  He tore through it, smiling all the way, saying "again, again."  It has been so fun spending extra time with the kids.  My mom and sister came in the weekend before Christmas.  <NAME/>'s parents and sister came in Friday.  With the couple of days between their visits, I remodeled our downstairs bathroom (strip wallpaper, paint, hung a border, hung crown molding).  That was my first try with crown molding. It turned out ok.  Thank the Lord for wood putty.  So, we've been pretty busy.  But, it's been fun.

How was your Christmas?  Was Santa Claus good to you?  I guess your kids were in.  I hope you had a wonderful time.  I'm looking forward to Corn Boys bowl game.  Anyway, I need to go make a call on a tee time.  <NAME/>'s dad and I decided that we would pay good money to get mad and lose a bunch of balls and break a few clubs, while out in the cold.  It doesn't make much sense, does it?  But then again, most things that men do don't make much sense.

Later,

<NAME/>

I could have sworn that I sent you this information earlier.  But I can't find it in my e-mail anywhere, so here it is:

Highest Priority
El Paso Gas Transmission Texas Pipeline (formerly PGE Texas and Valero)	Hub contract, Park & Lend contracts, inter- and intrastate transport
East Texas Gas Transmission (<NAME/> Energy Field Services)			Cartwheel agreement, transport

Secondary Priority
Guadalupe Pipeline (<NAME/> Energy Field Services)					Intra- and interstate transport
Oasis Pipeline									"	"	"	"

El Paso Field Services Channel							"	"	"	"
Oneok Westex (Westar)								"	"	"	"
Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline (Midcon)						"	"	"	"
Tejas Pipeline

The contracts on the pipes listed under "Highest Priority" are required for us to trade in the 3 main areas in Texas (EOL).  We must have these on day one.  The secondary contracts/pipes will be used soon after start up and are ranked in order of importance.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Again, I thought that I sent this to you a couple of weeks ago. Sorry for the delay.

Right now guys we will do our best to keep the station on line however we can't predict what flows will be.  If we don't have 
the volumes we can't do it.
The gas prices so far for Oct. look higher going to Cal. border.  We will have to see if we have the volumes next week to 
run the pigs.  Sure would have been nice to have run pigs this week everyone could see that flows were up and we should
have taken advantage of this.  Again, we will take a look at all scenario's next week.  

Thanks DS

We recently purchased house with a spa in the backyard. After filling with water and adjusting to the correct ph and bromine levels, the water smells like mildew.  Is there a way to treat this chemically?  I thought that the smell was coming from the cover at first. But, I have thoroughly cleaned the cover inside and out.  Could the smell be coming from the air/water lines?  It appears that the previous owners did not take care of some things around the house.


Thanks.

Anoush, 
I have talked with <NAME/> Phillips with Cinergy Worldwide.    His company is an experienced residential load aggregator in the Northeast.  They are not related to the Cinergy utility.      They are interested in a partnership with <NAME/>/New Power where Cinergy would market directly to individuals using our paper/ terms in return for a negotiated fee.
He is interested in entering the Texas Choice arena.     They claim to be capable of size in signups.

I thought that this may be a good fit for NewP. 
The number for  <NAME/> Phillips is :   410-365-5613


Let me know what your thoughts are.

<NAME/>, Teb is right..  Beginning with June billing for May production, we are billing FTS-2 reservation invoices on
June 1 instead of May 31.  At some point in time we may move back to the last day of the month.  This would be 
after we have (1) automated the manual process or (2) managed to speed up the manual process to effectively
capture the scheduled volumes for the last day of the month.  <NAME/> I have not confused the issue for you.

Keoni,

Here are the details on our sale to CERS for HE 14 at Palo Verde devers.
 
I spoke with Linus at CERS at approximately 11:50--At that time I sold him 90 mws at $29 delivered at PV for HE 14, I told him the energy was coming from the CAISO.

I then called <NAME/> at SRP marketing after speaking with Linus. For HE 13 I had sold <NAME/> 75 mws. I told him the schedule would be going to a zero for HE 14.

I called the CAISO to notify them my export EPMI_CISO_SALSA would be going to CERS at PV devers and not SRP.

I began speaking with Bhavin at the Palo Verde desk at 12:20 regarding scheduling of the energy to CERS at PV devers.

I told Bhavin the export -EPMI_CISO_SALSA- would be going to CERS and that it was effectively a net schedule(90 mws out at PV devers/90 mws in at PV devers).Bhavin asked that I call a counterparty with a control area interest at PV and show the schedule going to and coming from a control area.

I acknowledged this request and called El Paso Electric to attempt to show the schedule to them and from them. I was not comfortable with this step as I viewed it as unnecessary and told EPE I would call them back. I then called SRP transmission to discuss the schedule with them. At approximately 12:40 I discussed the 90 mw net schedule with SRP transmission. SRP control said a net schedule would show as zero.

I then spoke with EPE and told them to forget the schedule.

I called Bhavin back and told him SRP was aware of the schedule.
Bhavin told me that he would make a note of the schedule and show it as net scheduled.

At 13:02 Bhavin called me back and told me he was not checking out with SRP at PV devers.
I called SRP transmission and went over the schedule one more time. SRP transmission still showed the 75 mw schedule from HE 13. I told SRP transmission that the 75 mw schedule was no longer flowing to him. He told me he would call his marketer.

While transacting for HE 15, I again spoke with <NAME/> at SRP marketing and <NAME/> told me he had missed telling his transmission to pull out the 75 mw schedule.

I believe the original problem was the net scheduling and that it was compounded by miscommunication on SRP's end. It should be noted that Bhavin was polite and professional throughout my conversations with him. 


I think the ability to net schedule at tie points is important.  My feeling is that the CAISO schedulers should have the same scheduling capabilities at the tie points as those schedulers outside the CAISO. Please let me know what you find out regarding this practice. If you have any questions for me please let me know.

Thank you for your help.

<NAME/>

Hi There!

Here's the scoop on Friday night.  I have attached the "e mail" I received in case you are wondering what's going on.  I reserve the right to blow it all off and go to dinner or whatever we feel like, OK!  

It was great up at Lake Conroe this last weekend.  Weather was perfect.  It was even warm enough to go out on the wave runners.  This weekend should be even better!  

I might go to Las Vegas tonight .  A friend was served with divorce papers today and is not doing real well and wants to go for 24 hours.  We would have to be back Wednesday night since he has to be over in Louisiana Thursday.  If I go what number do you want me to bet for you on roulette?  I would have said 38 but that's to high a number, (JUST KIDDING)   Your laughing , right!  Its not really a great time since I have such a large position, but Its something I need to do.  I would appreciate it if you did not say anything about Las Vegas here at work since Im not sure how much Im going to tell everyone.

Im looking forward to Friday night!
<NAME/>'t forget your number for roulette.

I agree -  a fundamental assumption of the MNA is that square setoff works and that you can setoff financial and physical commodity contracts.  To make it work, all parties must sign the MNA.  From there you need to believe that square setoff works and that the bankruptcy court will allow the setoff and not make an issue of "the lack of mutuality" taking into consideration that the assets of the bankrupt party may be being used to satisfy liabilities of the non-bankrupt party.

4.5. Termination Offset.  Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination Date, the Notifying Party may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Affected Party by the Notifying Party or any Affiliate of the Notifying Party under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed by the Affected Party to the Notifying Party or any of the Notifying Party's Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s).  The obligations of the Affected Party and the Notifying Party under this Agreement in respect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by the Notifying Party and/or the Notifying Party's Affiliates.  The Notifying Party will give the Affected Party notice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section 4.5, "Owed" shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Termination Date.  Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section 4.5 may be converted by the Notifying Party into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rate of exchange at which the Notifying Party, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being converted.  If an obligation is unascertained, the Notifying Party may in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in this Section 4.5 shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest except as may be provided under applicable law.  This setoff provision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff, netting, off-set, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represent and acknowledge that the rights set forth in this Section 4.5 are an integral part of the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  The parties further acknowledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as principal and, with respect to this Section 4.5, as agent on behalf of its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section 4.5 and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had entered into this Agreement as its relates to Section 4.5.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Notifying Party shall not be required to pay to the Affected Party any amount under Section 4.5 until the Notifying Party receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind whatsoever of the Affected Party to make any payments to the Notifying Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied.

I am so sorry about <NAME/>.  It is very difficult for me to accept that he is gone.  He was a very special man to me as I was growing up.  <NAME/> was as much like an Uncle to me as any of my blood relatives.  He always represented the pillar of strength while still being able to to be one of the most loving and compassionate people I have ever known.  To me <NAME/> was everything a man was supposed to be.  

It always made me proud to talk to <NAME/> about my football games and later on the oil and gas business.  It was neat that in a way I was following a similiar path in life to the one that <NAME/> had taken.  And when my daughter was born I began to see how he must of felt about his three wonderful daughters, who I still consider to be like sisters to me.  I was so excited when Little <NAME/> was born this year because I knew how proud and excited he must have been to finally have his boy.  I hope someday I have the opportunity to tell him what a special man his Grandpa was. 

The thing I always will remember about <NAME/> was that when he walked into a room, he filled it up, not because of his size, but because of his enormous personality and lust for life.  He could always put a smile on your face. The world has lost a very special man.

I know this is hard for you and the girls.  It is hard for me to write this without breaking up. I Love you guys and wish I was there with you.

Frontera will be running short for the schedule listed below.      I have sold them this imbalance for $28.57.    Any imbalance charges billed to them should be allocated to me listed on the schedule below.

hour ending 7 - 320
he 8 -320
he 9 - 320
he 10 - 215
he 11 - 150
he 12 - 50 

The total is 1375.   This is the equivalent of a financial swap,  but the settlement will remain intact.

Thanks,

A lot of shops are interested,  mainly speculators.       I have had at least 7 different counterparties use this.      Utilities or generators have a big interest in hedging their balancing energy exposure,  locking in a fixed return.   How they are exposed to the imbalance price is their business, as I am not encouraging running an imbalance, etc.
No problem with EOL,  as we are trading it up.
You need to add the US PWR Financial Swap to your EOL profile, in my opinion.     You will see Ercot S 8-22  and N 8-22.   You will need to add these and every other hour listed.
Thanks,

Take the TransCanada Hwy 1 west to Calgary.  This becomes 16 Ave N in the city.

Take Highway 2 south (Deerfoot) when you get in the city.

When you come to the Deerfoot/Glenmore intersection take Glenmore Trail East.

On Glenmore, you'll pass under Macleod Trail (there is a big mall Chinook centre on your right), you'll pass over the Glenmore reservoir.

When you get to Glenmore and 37 st get in the inside lane of Glenmore.  After 45 st, Glenmore will split in 2, stay in the inside (i.e. leftmost lanes).

This fork will lead you to a stop light where you turn left onto Highway 8 Bragg Creek.

On highway 8 you will pass 69st, after the light get in the outside lane and take your next right on Lower Springbank Rd.  At the the stop sign turn left onto Lower Springbank, you should now be going parallel to Highway 8.  After 85 st and before 101st there is a gravel entrance road on your right, take this road, it is 100 feet long and leads to Slopeview Dr, turn left when the gravel road joins the pavement and go to 133 Slopeview Dr.

No problem...and you still need to see the Yankee Doodle Dandy movie, very patriotic and especially poignant for an independence day baby.  As for gas trading land, things are good.  Everyday I become a little more comfortable with the region I'm trading as well as the ins and outs of the pipeline and storage systems.  Sorry to hear about the ag group's demise, but I'm guessing there are some great opportunities to be had on the weather desk so congratulations are in order (as usual you have landed on your feet).  What's <NAME/> going to be up to as a result of this?  

Anyway, glad you got in some vacation time before the move and as luck would have it over your birthday.  Did you make it back to Cali or head to your new second home, <NAME/>?  I'm assuming the book you are referring to is Market Wizards...I haven't read it yet, but have heard much about it from some of the other traders on the desk.  Maybe I should give it a look, if only to see what kind of things I'll need to write about once I join that circle...attitude is key.

The balancing pool committed in the their beginning of year release to dispatch Milner as follows:

70 MW @ $0
50 MW @ $35.49

Milner has been down for maintenance until recently.

Since coming back from maintenace, the 50 MW block @ $35.49 has disappeared.  We analyzed the offer stack and it appears
that Milner has the full 120 MW @ $0

I called <NAME/> <NAME/> to discuss this.  He hasn't called me back. 

The issue I raised last week about Sherness dispatch is OK. I received a justified answer.  However, this Milner issue is harder for th pool to defend.

Can we pursue this.

Hopefully I will know some more in a week or so...and when I do I will definitely give you a shout and let you know how things are playing out.

We did not sell anything until after June 30th.  Go ahead and call Lou, but why would you use December 31st; clearly things are lower in June.  Do you get to pick and choose by each stock which date to use? I'm in the office today but traveling a lot this week.  If you need to reach me after today, please leave me a message at work and I will call you back.  Also Do we need to include the 2,400 from Suntrust in my mom's estate since it was held by both my brother (who closed the account this weekend) and my mother?

<NAME/>,

Attached is a term sheet showing price indications for the products that we talked about.  The market it down today so they may appear to be a little high.  I am still working on a structure term sheet for the pipeline capacity that we breifly discussed.  Please give me a call and we can update these prices for you or we can adjust the structures if these are not the products that fit your needs.

I would like to be prepared in the case that we are able to put physical or financial transactions together.  In order to do so, we would like to put both a physical purchase/sale agreement and perhaps an ISDA master swap agreement in place.  One thing we would need is someone to contact for financial or credit information so that we can insert the appropriate credit language in the contract drafts that we send to you.

Please let me know if you have any questions and I will be in touch with the transport structure.

Thanks,

<NAME/>, 

I don't think that the Agency agreement is going with HPL.  If that has changed, please let me know.  I asked <NAME/> Baumbach about it and he agreed with me.

As far as signing the agreement, I need one thing added.  Under Section 4.A., we need to add something like, "IN the event that ENA owes Company, payment will be made to Company after ENA has received funds from third party sales of excess supply."  This situation has occurred when the plant was down for the majority of the month.  ENA sold the supply and net owed Tenaska IV a large sum of money after the admin fee was netted out.

Additionally, TXU pipeline has sent an amendment to the transport contract (adding receipt points).  The contract still has Tenaska Gas Co as a counterparty, instead of <NAME/> North America.  How do we get this corrected?

I am no longer the book admin handling the trader referenced by the deal below.  I have taken the liberty of forwarding this email to the individual now running the book in question.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

Thanks,

<NAME/>,
I will be in El Paso visting EPE on the 20th.
But I am very interested in discussing such an opportunity with NW service customers.
Do they HAVE to come on the morning of the 20th or 21st? Could they come the morning of the 19th?
Let's get together and talk regardless.

Nice job on NCPA, I appreciate the hard work.
Thanks,
<NAME/>

Update on a new swing supplier as of 4:00 PM on Friday

I've called PanCanadian, e prime, Cinergy, Reliant, Coral, ONEOK, and Entergy-Koch.  I'm waiting for most of these people to call me back.  The only positive response I've had is from Coral and he still doesn't know if he can sell us gas even if we prepay.  ONEOK is the only counterparty that said they will NOT do business with us because we owe them $40 million.

Today we learned that Bridgeline sent comfort letters to their customers, informing their customers that Bridgeline will NOT sell us gas.

<NAME/>, it looks like Monday may be another fire drill day but I promise to keep working on it until 1) I have two suppliers that will work with ENA or 2) I've run out of customers to call.

<NAME/> asked some lady to call me back and she didn't know either.  At first she did it the way you show it on your worksheet.  Then when I told her that normal demand charges ( a 1 year deal at max for example) are the same each month regardless of how many days there are in the month she got confused.  I guess we will find out when we get the invoice.

Keoni,
I thought your email regarding the running of CONG with a heuristic rather than optimal solution may address and solve the problem. I have not yet been able to pull up "corrected" prices but hopefully they will now reflect our bids. The problems I referred to in my phone message last week were similar to what my original email detailed. Basically, we were awarded mw's on a congestion management schedule and the published prices did not match our bids. <NAME/> the change in running the "solutions" change this? Our volume management group will then be inputing our bid price rather than the published congestion management price--as those prices are not yet published correctly. 

I will be in the office this week and can be reached at your convenience.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

Comments from trading track phone interviews:


<NAME/> Baloutch  -  recommendation: invite in for interview  -  excellent academic results, very smart, some summer gas experience with BC gas, did some work with weater derivatives,  very enthusiatic 

<NAME/> Betancourt  -  recommendation: do not invite for interview - unable to communicate relavent experience.

Seung "<NAME/>" Hyun Cho -  recommendation:  invite for interview ( however, <NAME/> does not graduate until May '02, so Associate program recruiting may be a better fit.)  excellent academic results,  able to discuss a wide variety of subject material regarding trading,  strong understanding of risk and derviatives.

The lease is freely assignable. The lien rights are based not contractual, but exist in Texas law.  I used to have some info on Texas lien law, don't remember if I still do. I haven't worked a warehouseman lien issue. However, in general it is one thing to have a lien, and another to be able to foreclose on it, especially that quickly. In short, I don't know if whatever <NAME/> is saying they will do in the timeframe described is permissible. 

Rigby, you have any info on warehouseman liens in Texas?

Jerry,
Please see the attached spreadsheet for tomorrow.

Also,  to fill Mirant's call for 12-22 we purchased $23 power from Aquila.    This should get you flat for the day.

We will not run tomorrow,  as of now.    We will reflect this in the Resource Plan and reflect that the unit is unavailable and offline.

Per my discussion with <NAME/> Evans - MidAmerican agreed to pay ENA for this gas and will not net this deal with any other deal.  We also discussed doing this deal under a GISB agreement but if we have some other post-bankruptcy agreement that we can trade under then that's fine with me.  You and Stacy can decide if we need to put any of this information on the confirm.
 
Stacy also has some comments below pertaining to the GST tax that should may need to be included in the confirm.  I did not discuss the GST tax, I felt fortunate that someone would do business with me.

Deal		Counter party					Sitara Contract
             0		California Energy Hub, SOCAL			96063621		
this is an exchange deal.  California Energy Hub is not listed on the Master Letter Log.  Socal is but there  are no contract numbers listed.  The hedge on this deal was killed in Sitara on 1/8/02.  The March invoice is for demand charges of $.10 x 310,000 dth per day, which may be incorrect.  Its possible that the volume should be 310,000 dth per MONTH.

773141		Central Illinois Light Company			96000389		
No changes made to Sitara ticket since 5/4/01.  Per Master Letter Log - ENA cancelled the financial agreement due to Central's failure to pay.  No reference is made to the physical deal.  Per Sitara - this deal has a min and max volume.  The March invoice is for demand charges of $.425 x 10,000 dth per day.

889014		Colorado Spring Utilities				96062701		
No changes made to Sitara ticket since 6/29/01.  Per Master Letter Log - only activity with EPMI is listed, no mention of any contracts with ENA.  The March invoice is for demand charges of $7,200.00 per month.

22109		Consolidated <NAME/> Company of New York	96000908
Long term sale to ConEd on Tennessee pipeline.  Not listed on the Master Letter Log.  Per Sitara - the hedge in Sitara was killed on 11/26/01.  The March invoice is for demand charges of $101,339.35 which is a percentage of the Tenn Z1 and Z0 indexes.

1161432	Superior Natural Gas Company			96052897
Not listed on the Master Letter Log.  Per Sitara - hedge in Sitara was killed on 12/12/01.  This is a sale to Superior with a NYMX trigger, the trigger was entered in Sitara on 11/6/01 at 14:32 and the trigger price was $3.05.  The March invoice is for the difference between the trigger price of $3.05 and Nx1 for March $2.388 = $.662 x 10,000 dth per day x 31 days.

1201382	TXU Fuel Company				96096343
This deal probably should not be in Sitara.  Its related to sales made by the Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd. to TXU.  This activity used to handled by the Texas Desk.  If Feb 2002, it was decided that all activity should flow through the partnership instead of ENA.  I took all prices on this deal to 0.

<NAME/>, 

In order to book the imbalance payback between HPL and Lobo, I have created deal 1166748 (ENA selling to AEP @ $2.45).  I have changed the price on Deal 1109140 from $0.00 to $2.455.  From what I understand, we received the gas at <NAME/> Ranch, sold it to AEP so that they would move it through the header on their contract and bought it back at a half cent difference.  Following that, we sold the gas to the central desk, who sold it to Oneok at the South Texas pool.  With the changes I made and the entries you are able to do, hopefully this deal will be wrapped up.  Let me know if you need me to do anything else.

Group,
Effective October 1st...BPA transmission will be the following prices...

BPA non-firm point to point (or network) will be $2.92 with 1.9% losses

BPA non-firm on the intertie will be $3.34 with 3% losses

Losses could be expected to add up to $5 of the total price--do not put losses into the purchase from BPA Transmission in Enpower--losses for BPA will be settled at the end of the month in a single annuity.

Total price for MPC to CAISO at MALIN on BPA non-firm all the way will be $6.26
Total price for MPC to CAISO at NOB on BPA NON-FIRM all the way will be $6.26--Remember to check tranny sheet for PGE-tranny availability--WE HAVE NO MORE LT FIRM FROM BIG EDDY TO NOB--

SNOPud is charging $3.25 for point to point plus 1.9% losses.

We must notify the Control room (GENCO)  personnel concerning any deviation from the preschedule.  
 For example,   when we have availability,    or even "must sell"  situations off of Frontera,  the Control Room must revise their Resource Plan.    They need to revise in order to prevent an Area Control Error problem. 

They have the same deadline (two hours before hour ending)  that we face in submitting QSE trades - give them timely info so that they can get their side in.    


For now,  you can use the Stento (dial 5 432) or telephone 877-294-3900.     Of course,  you can just knock on the door.
In Ercot only,   we are allowed to exchange information with the control room.    No other region has this capability.


Thanks,
JMForney

Hey Corey,

Was wondering if you and <NAME/> still had any interest in the Concert Sat. night.  Drop me a line and let me know if you want to go ahead and buy tickets (they're $15 a piece).  The box office opens at 8:00 and doors open at 9:00, but the last time I went there there was a line to get in by 8:45...I would recommend showing up around 8:15 or so to make sure you get a seat inside.  Still trying to figure out how guilty I'd feel missing this bachelorette party...

Group,

When doing imports and exports at tie points for other desks, be sure to put the other desk as the Customer in CAPS.  This prevents inappopriate charges going against the real-time book.  Import and Export fees are typically in the nature of $5 per mm on a wheel.

I believe I did because 1) I used the .12 rate in pricing the deals in my system and the deals are at a fixed price which means I had to calculate it  
AND 2) I had the discounts on gas flow before the 14th and gas flow on days after the 14th
AND 3) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on Sat or Sun.

Its only a diff of $80 or so. So if its difficult or "improper" don't worry about it.

I just went over the March prepayment with <NAME/> <NAME/> (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations

	Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00
	Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)

						Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00

There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but <NAME/> will let us know about that later.

<NAME/>, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?

Hi <NAME/>,

Laird gave me your name and number so that I can pass on notional price information that you asked for.  Let me know anytime you need to see our price indications and I will do what I can to help you.  I know that Laird has worked with you guys extensively.  The prices that he said you were looking at are listed below and are based on PG&E City gate prices:

Q4, 2001                			    $11.70
2 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2003		    $ 6.80
5 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2006		    $ 5.85
Oct. 2001 - Dec. 2003	  		    $ 7.38

I tried to call but it was after hours for you.  Give me a call and let me know where you are with your gas supply negotiations and I will try to pick up where Laird left off.

Regards,

Hi
thanks - I think we should delete highlighted language but lets confirm w CY.  Also I think we should discuss whether the definition should roll w the WSPP (see black highlighted language) - we rolled because WSPP, we thought, rolled.  Now we know it doesn't. I don't think our other products roll.  How about a brief call w you me and CY.  Sorry to add layers off confusion, but the WSPP rolling has been of gnawing frustration; hence ...

<NAME/>,

I would like to recommend a promotion for <NAME/> Olsen.  <NAME/> has been instrumental to the Texas Desk.  With the sale of HPL, we were left with only one scheduler with Texas experience.  <NAME/> took on the responsibility that two people were carrying prior to the sale of the pipeline (Waha scheduling).  He trained our new hire, <NAME/> Smith, and assisted in developing scheduling processes at the <NAME/> Hub.  Prior to the sale of HPL, all of our activity at the <NAME/> hub passed through the pipeline.  <NAME/> used his knowledge of the Waha hub and helped develop a net out procedure that allowed us to effectively schedule our transactions.  Since June, <NAME/> has handled the logistics activities of the majority of Texas pipes (Westar, HPL, PGE, Channel, Oasis, Guadalupe).  <NAME/> most outstanding accomplishment is the over $30,000 he saved us in hub transport fees from July to November.  In July, I began tracking the amount of hub fees that we should have to pay in the Waha area (on EOL we transacted on the basis that the seller pays the transport fees through the hub).  <NAME/> used his knowledge of the pipes, his business relationships, and his negotiation skills to decrease the amount of gas that we scheduled under our contracts.  In essence, I kept a sort of P&L for him.  <NAME/> has taken the desks responsibilities upon himself, as if this were his business.  With the limited number of people on our desk, I needed to split my time between Logistics and Trading.  Truthfully, I spent the majority of my time with the trading.  <NAME/> handled the daily logistics responsibilities.  He acted as lead, supervising and training <NAME/>, our other team member.  <NAME/> performed at a senior level since his first month with the desk.  <NAME/> came to the desk with experience on the pipeline side of the business, accepting nominations and confirming the plants and interconnects. He came to the Texas desk and exceeded all of my expectations. He has advanced quicker than any of the schedulers I've seen.  In fact, he has gone from very minimal marketing logistics knowledge to explaining transactions and processes to other people in the industry with more experience than him.  In short, <NAME/> has been the heart of the Texas Logistics team.  His abilities and hard work have reduced our transport fees, kept our headcount low (he has fulfilled the responsibilities of two people), and enabled the Texas Desk to close time sensitive deals and transact in increasingly complicated deals.  <NAME/> is a superior employee.  His knowledge, ability, and hard work are essential to the success of the Texas Desk.  Please support him with a promotion.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need any information. 
Thanks.

<NAME/>

From time to time we have applicants from other shops that interview with our desk for RT trading, scheduling, or other positions.
If you recognize someone from another firm,  or know who they are,  do not discuss their interest in <NAME/> with anyone else.

Recently,  we have had two applicants who have reported that others at their firm knew that they had interviewed with <NAME/>.  Both felt that someone in this shop had discussed their visit here.    Totally unacceptable.     I have to ensure that this information is not coming from  my group, hence this note.

Common sense would dictate that discretion is necessary in these situations.   If you have any feedback on this situation I would like to hear it.   

Thanks for your attention to this very important issue.

Hourly deals should be under Teco SVC the majority of the time.    However,  at times <NAME/>'s option (under Ercot Asset book)  will be long into the Real Time market.
This is Frontera generation,  but <NAME/> bought it in the form of the option. 
You will see deals of this type for today under the Ercot Asset.

So hourly deals:
Teco Services - 99% of time
Ercot Asset - 1 %

On Oasis and PGEV, we have been buying and selling as HPL.  However, we have been transporting the gas under ENA.  This is primarily for spot and base deals.  We want to keep these transport contracts with ENA.  The only term deal we have at Waha is to Tufco (0-60,000/day).  This deal is under ENA with it's own firm transport contract (now on Guadalupe Pipeline, which was previously Teco/PGEV).  The sale and transport will go with HPL.  The sale to Entex off of Oasis (currently under the ENA, will be assigned to HPL) must be served off of Oasis.  So HPL will need to acquire an Oasis contract for this deal.  Let me know if you have any more questions.

We have been short listed on an rfp for Noresco, a power plant developer.  Attached are the financial statement for the parent who is willing to guarantee the project.  They plan to refresh prices and perhaps transact this week.  they have received contracts from other potential suppliers already.  I got the RFP late and therefore, I am running behind.  I am attaching my proposal in case you need it.  It will basically be a full requirements transaction out of our Socal Pool for up to 20 years.

CAN WE MAKE THIS OUR NUMBER 1 PRIORITY AND GET CONTRACTS TO THEM TODAY??  PLEASE?  I WILL SUPPLY BEVERAGES LATER IN THE WEEK OR PERHAPS A TICKET TO ASTROS TONIGHT (if I can find them!)  

Please call and let me know if we can make this hurdle!

Thanks for your reply.
Here's what I have learned from our conversation:
Since I have not gotten a specific response from my customers,  my spots were "captured" by <NAME/> and <NAME/>'s group?
I acknowledge that I have not relayed specific names for Reliant and TXU, as they havent responded after many calls,   but did not receive notice that I was to lose my spots.
I expected to be able to include my employees,  as <NAME/> and <NAME/> have now done with my spots.

<NAME/> and <NAME/> have invited my employee,  <NAME/> Olinde,  with one of my original spots.   He will attend.

I am not trying to give you a hard time,  but I need to know who authorized filling my spots?

I did a buy/sale with EES where EES will give me TCO pool gas and I will give EES TCO pool or CGLF Leach gas.  The volume is 14,288 per day.

The purchase deal is 1068442, at CGAS IF.  This deal will not change.

The sale deal is #1068455, at CGAS IF - .05.  I have 2 meters on this deal, Kimat, let me know if that will be a problem booking the deal in tagg.

<NAME/>, please chat with <NAME/> on which contract to use.  We need to use the same Gulf contract all month long.  It would probably be easier for <NAME/> if we use the same contract we used this month.

<NAME/> - 
How is business?   Things not as fun here as PDX.
I am still in the market for a car and I have a strong candidate:    1990 Carrera 2 cabriolet.    It has 64k and the interior is flawless.
The exterior has a couple of dings and some rock chips,  etc in the front.    The paint has some waterspots on the hood as well.
The guy that owns it is a geek and never has waxed the car.     It may be possible to get these out by a detail shop.

Heres the kicker:   the guy is asking $27,500 negotiable.     I think I can get this for $24,500 or 25k.         It needs tires and one of the headlight lenses has a rock chip.   The car drives great.

Do you know of anything that I need to look out for with this particular model?   The engine is a 3.6 litre and it runs great.    Can a detail shop get out smudges and waterspots?   The blue book trade in on this vehicle in good condition is $24,000.   The retail is supposedly $33k.
What am I missing here?

Thanks,
<NAME/>

As of Sunday, January 20, 2002 
Griffith Power plant located off of TW's mainline was declared operational for Commercial Usage to the Power Grid market.

Gas Control Issues:
Nominations:
Their could be nominations every day for flow from El Paso and TW depending on the price and transportation agreements
between <NAME/> and PPL.
You will see a total nom for the TW side in your daily orders and the El Paso order will have to come from the TW logistics 
Team.

Flows:
We may have to batch the El Paso volumes depending on the nominations.  We will watch the noms this week to get a feel
of where and how much they may vary.  
As agents for Citizens under the EMAR umbrella, We will need to get with the El Paso controller and let them know that your
going to open their side to be Primary and start taking flow from them to accumulate the order.(If this looks like it is going to be
small volumes we may need to batch the gas and work with El Paso Controllers.)  
Currently at the Griffith Power Plant TW and El Paso screens the primary control set point is 1 (TW primary)  
When you need to flow from El Paso you will need to switch the service to 2 (El Paso primary), and flow the gas until accumed
and switch back to 1 (TW primary). 
If anyone has a question on this please call me and we can walk through it.  Again as EMAR we are to make the changes at the
Site from Gas Control.
The only time we should get the Citizens people involved with the I/C is if we have a problem with Primary switches or pressure
problems.  Please refer to the call out sheet on the Console for Citizens.

Please don't hesitate to call if you need help.

Thanks DS

Thanks <NAME/>,
I have a question:  on the Ercot transmission outage  page,   the TU  Bellmead station is listed as having trouble - the buss is damaged due to storm.    Is this the reason that there are TU CSC's, as mentioned on the Ercot conference call?  The station is to be out until August 10th.  We have had a significant price split and I think that this might be the specific reason.
I have tried powerworld,  but I couldnt turn off this station.

What do you think?

Nothing so far.  Joe Parks is checking with Bridgeline to see if we can buy gas from them.  It was late in the day before PanCanadian called.  I don't think PanCanadian will work because they do not have the flexibility to sell different daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

I hope we can work out a deal with Bridgeline.  Joe or I will be calling them first thing this morning.  

Yesterday afternoon Tallahassee indicated that they may not need the swing gas for the weekend.

Price:		$2.25
Volume:	1,121,702
Location:	MPC/Dry Creek Storage/2-02125-1

<NAME/>, there is a storage contract 7010 in Unify for MPC.  I assume this is the contract that needs to be pathed in Unify to withdraw the storage gas.  Do you get any statements from MPC?

Ercot has a problem that could cause us great financial pain:   
Sometimes when we are  submitting an hourly schedule, through the Ercot Portal,  the Day-ahead schedules are affected.
Mismatches for every counterparty occur.     We are subject to the hourly price for mismatches and this could prove extremely costly, even for one hour.
    <NAME/> Saibi spoke with the Ercot help desk who indicated that the problem was on our side.

I called Ercot  and after some time,  they relayed that they were experiencing server problems.

Attached below is the ticket number related to this problem.   If this occurs again,   make sure that you reference this number.

AJ,
Thanks for checking in with me.   I had a couple of questions:
Does Anadarko have any power plants or do they trade gas/electricity actively?      I currently do several things:
I am the Manager of the real time Power Trading desk.    I also manage the Ercot Asset book.   I trade around a combined cycle gas plant in south Texas.
I am required to trade gas along with  the power in order to properly hedge the plant.
I would be interested in continuing in this area. 

Thanks for anything you can tell me about working at Anadarko.   I could send my resume,  but if we dont have paralell needs,  then I wont bother.
I have some other things that I am working on.

Thanks again for asking.  This company will be fine,  but I have worked 12-14 hours/day for 8+ years.   When the stock price is $90, I can somewhat justify the hours and lack of life.   However,   although I am sure that <NAME/> will bounce back,  I am no longer willing to sacrifice to make it so.    

I have been consistenly profitable in my time here.   I have never been on a losing team - we have always made major money for the company,  so it is very hard to understand how this whole thing is unwinding.

Anyway,  thanks again and I look forward to hearing from you.

that facility really didn't have much of an academic program.  at this age it doesn't matter but i nicer to have them in an environment that fits all needs now and later,.  it better not to move kids alot.

<NAME/>, 

We have priced these at the money puts and they are kind of expensive.  For the monthly put, Strike of $2.72, premium would be $.495.  For the Daily put, the premium would be $.535.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Prices might be lower tomarrow given the downturn since AGA's came out.  If you are willing to look at out of the money puts, the price would be better as well.

Hey <NAME/>,

Ok, first the bad news...I can't come up President's weekend for the Whistler trip.  Now the good news, I'm going to be in Seattle next weekend.  I'm coming to have a 2nd round interview with Cascade Natural Gas (whose headquarters is actually right around downtown - looks like maybe Belltown).  Anyway, I fly in Thursday and don't leave until Monday.  The interview will be Friday, much like my set-up last time.  So, if you're going to be in town we definitely have to get together.  I think I'm really going to look for housing on this trip.  Maybe that will be the goal for Saturday.

Talk to you soon,

Sorry I didn't call this weekend, but I was swamped Saturday and subsequently exhausted on Sunday.  I basically rotated from my bed to the couch to the pool to the couch and back to bed.  Pitiful but much needed.  Anyway, I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for me.  Departing the 14th and returning the 26th...which I believe puts me into Seoul Wednesday night and departing on a Sunday.  You can either call or email if you have any questions for me.  And, I'll decide where I'd like to go for the long weekend.  I may pick two and just let you two decide the final destination.

Yesterday the Frontera plant was idle due to economics.   We had  submitted a Resource Plan (this indicates to Ercot what we plan to generate) with zero mw's and zero premium  because the unit was offline.   In the Resource Plan,  we can  attach a premium for OOM up or down.   In the plan for yesterday we indicated that our unit was "unavailable and offline".  
   The plant personel are responsible for submitting an outage schedule with Ercot - this cannot be completed by the QSE.

Ercot called yesterday and asked if we could start the unit if they needed us to.   We called Jerry Watson (with Frontera) and he relayed that this was possible.   Ercot immediately OOM'd us up 135 mw's, beginning hour ending 13,  to control congestion.   They later upped this to 185 mw's for the remainder of the day, through 2400.
I called <NAME/> Patterson, who is our Ercot Rep.,  and I explained the situation.   I wished to know how they could OOM us if we were offline.   I also wanted to know how this would settle.

His reply is as follows:

Since we indicated verbally that we could run the plant,  that changed our status from unavailable to available.
Since we had an implied low premium (zero)  on our plant,  we were high in the OOM stack and were called upon.
We would receive only the mcp for our power because we had no premium indicated.  The mcp was low all day ( mid teens)  yesterday.
If we had been OOM'd up and could not recover our startup & gen costs,  we could dispute the bill and provide sufficient documentation to recover, at most, our costs.



We immediately revised our Resource Plan and indicated 185 mw's available  with a $50 premium.    This invoked the Protocol provisions requiring them to pay us the 18 heat rate times gas costs.   
The Protocol section dealing with OOM up payments is found under section 6.8.2.2.   Please review this to understand why this applies.



This was a very educational process.    We think that in revising our Resource Plan "on the fly"  we were able to turn a bad situation into a profitable day for Frontera.


Until further notice, the following policy should be implemented:

If Frontera is offline and Ercot calls to ask about the availability.    Say the unit is NOT available.

If Frontera is scheduled to run, need to input into the Resource Plan the following premiums:

$50 premium for OOM up.
$10 premium for OOM down.

These premiums will be added to the mcp and will be used to determine our place in the merit order.
If we are OOM'd up,   the premium will require that the heat rate formula is invoked.

If we are OOM'd down,  then we should be paid the mcp + premium.

Please call me if you have questions,

Actually I am.  The little woman and the little bundle of joy both sleep in the other room.  Makes it easy for me.  My woman is trying to breastfeed.  I can't tell you how stressfull that has been.  There needs to be a class for guys on how to best support their "Woman" after birth.

Ahhh, my little bundle of joy is cute though.  And her mom lives in town and spends a lot of time over at out place which works out great.  We can go out for dinner pretty easy.

If the last Hoegh Galleon cargo of this year is diverted to Puerto <NAME/>, the economics of sending non-Cabot LNG to Puerto <NAME/> are different than those mentioned in my prior note.

Based on current prices, there is $0.7 MM of value that could be captured between <NAME/> LNG and Eco on the diversion. This represents the price difference between what it would cost to buy back our sale to ENA at CMS and what Eco would have had to pay Cabot for a Winter Cargo. If CMS would let us out of the terminal fee or let it apply to a future delivery, that would add an additional $1 MM of value. If Cabot had to give up its Demand Charge and Demand Surcharge (hard to imagine) on the Winter Cargo, that adds another $4.7 MM.

A second Hoegh Galleon cargo should add $1.5 MM but would need to be sourced from Nigeria or Algeria(???). 

Cabot controls the date of the Last Cargo delivered in 2001. It can be November 23-December 15 (unless another date is mutually agreeable). The date of this last delivery determines the earliest date that Eco would be able to receive the Hoegh Galleon. The earliest that Eco could receive the Hoegh Galleon should therefore be between December 20 and January 11 - depends on Cabot. 

Eco would be able to receive a second Hoegh Galleon cargo as soon as 29 days after the first Hoegh Galleon cargo delivery or as late as 45 days after. Two Hoegh Galleon cargoes should give Eco enough fuel (barely) to get them to the dates where they are eligible to receive the Early Spring cargo (100 days after the Last Cargo of 2001). 

In addition to the $$$'s available to be captured, this program removes Eco's risk of not receiving a Winter Cargo from Cabot.

Economics and Timing -  The amount of value to be captured is most heavily influenced by December-January NYMEX prices. These impact our cost to buy back gas at the CMS tailgate and our cost to buy the second Hoegh Galleon cargo. Our gas cost is more subject to change than is the Cabot contract price we are trying to beat. If we had a crystal ball, we would lock-in the economics of the diversion and of the purchase of the second cargo when the NYMEX bottoms-out. The front of the price curve has lost ~$1.00/MMBtu in the last 2 weeks. Where will it go from here?

In order to be prepared to execute when market conditions are right, we need to get Eco on board and initiate discussions with a producer about supply for the second cargo. Also, we should talk with Gene Massey to confirm that the contract says what we think it says and to get his thoughts on what we are trying to do.

I would appreciate any insights that you may have regarding this opportunity.

Regards,

<NAME/>

Do my prepays to Reliant for gas fall under your exception comment below even though they are not same day payments?
 
I can prepare my weekly cash request for swing gas with 2 days notice. I will just need to maintain a bigger cash balance with Reliant - probably about $20,000 more than what I've been keeping.  Let me know what your preference is.
 
I have 2 important payments (estimate of $2.1 mill) going out next Tuesday that are on <NAME/>'s Cash Forecast worksheet but I won't know the price until late Friday afternoon - usually this only happens during bid week and I hope this qualifies as an exception (let me know about this one too).  I actually prefer to see the price in print the day after NYMEX rolls off.   I will also be hounding you several times next Tuesday afternoon just to make sure these payments go out on time.

I would like to recap my understanding and the "To Do's" from the meeting yesterday.  

		1.  After November 1, Measurement would NO longer adjust any TBS physical
	                 volumes unless there was a PPA directly influencing said TBS.

		2.  Measurement would check  to see if they had a deduct meter they were
	                 using in the end user process. (Since the meeting we have discovered that
	 	     the deduct meter IS in GVA, therefore no checking needs to be done).

		3.  Gas Logistics would check with IT on possible enhancement (if necessary) for
		     negative volumes to the TBS.  (We have talked with IT and this would be
		     a major enhancement and have to be done with the new system).

		4.  Procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers created by
		     the LDC giving measurement an end user actual volume greater than the 
		     TBS connected to NNG.

		5.  Measurement and Gas Logistics agreed that all measured volumes including
		     End User point volumes would be "housed' in PGAS.

	After further discussions in Gas Logistics, our recommendation is that neither Measurement or Gas Logistics accomodate a
	negative number.  If the LDC gives measurement an end user volume greater than the TBS the following should happen:

		1.  Measurement should either:

			a.  Call the LDC and let them know they cannot accept a volume at an end
			     user point higher than their TBS.

			b.  Or Measurement can call <NAME/> <NAME/> on the Gas Logistics Measurement Desk
			     and <NAME/> will call LDC with the same info.

		2.  If Measurement does not get an answer before measurement close, then measurement will
		     use the number equal to the TBS for the end user point.

	<NAME/> and <NAME/>, you may want to have more discussions on this topic.  I would be glad to regroup if you want.
	I have put a call into Marketing to talk to them about our concerns on this issue.  Also Raetta and <NAME/> are
	 going to go ahead and call Wisconsin Gas and get their explanation of why an end user point would be
	greater than the TBS.  Hopefully it is just a measurement error.  We will let you know the outcome.

	If there is something I missed, please let me know.  Thanks. <NAME/>

Hey girl,

Sorry, I received all of your messages, but did not respond, sorry.  So little C.J. looks like a "half-breed", (that's what you''re trying to say!).  Is he cute?  I can't wait to see him.  Yes, I did talk to <NAME/> yesterday afternoon, she sounded happy.  

I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop trying to go to work, especially if there are no health benefits that he will be losing.  Instead of concentrating on that job, I told him to concentrate on his health.  He said I was right, and said he was going to seriously consider it.  I had to laugh when he said he went to work and fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork.  That was hilarious.  Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding "little bitty" daddy sitting there asleep.  I cracked up.

The concert was good, you know those young men "showed out".  However, the concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had several acts before them and as a result, did not get out of the concert until 1:15 p.m.   I was a tired sister, but it was well worth it.  The <NAME/> Southwest is close to me, its right be Sharpstown Mall.  Tell me that dates again.  

Talk with you later.

<NAME/>,  I'm following up the voicemail I left you this morning.
 
In our initial discussions you indicated we could do business under an existing GISB agreement between <NAME/> North America and Reliant.  However, our legal department believes all of our GISB contracts with Reliant have been cancelled/terminated.  Attached is a standard GISB agreement for your review.  I understand that you need to send this to your legal department to include any special provisions that may be necessary.   
 
Please call me at 713-853-4743 or <NAME/> Boyt at 713-345-7754 and let me know if Reliant Energy Services is willing to trade under this agreement.

Attached is the contract that would govern this transaction.  <NAME/> and I have discussed San <NAME/> risks but we are willing to take it - however, the actual offer at this time is $4.65 for 15,000 to 20,000 delivered at the Blanco Pool.  When you are ready to transact, I will update the exact price at that time.  Let me know what you want to do.

Hey,

Just wanted to make sure you're still up for the MFA reception tomorrow night.  I told <NAME/> about it last night and she said she'd like to go as well.  So...the reception is supposed to start at 7:00 and go until 9:00 and I figured we could either go to an early dinner, or cut out of the reception a little bit early and go to dinner afterward (say around 8:00 - 8:30).  Of course, dinner doesn't have to factor in at all if we don't want it to...just a suggestion.  I'll give you call later tonight to hammer out the details.

See ya,

You need to path the change at mtr 8055.  You should not path the buyback at mtr 1040 (Only deals 538950 and 702826 should be pathed with volume.  All other deals at mtr 1040 should be pathed with zero volumes.)

With a heavy hand I write this message to the Aquila Merchant Services people.  As <NAME/> mentioned in his earlier message we must now reduce our Wholesale Group to reflect that we, ILA, do not have the credit capacity to continue to support the needs of the business.  Starting today we will begin to wind down our Commodity Services and CapitalServices groups, both in North America and in Europe, with the goal of being significantly out of all commercial operations by the end of the summer.  Later today we will take the first step to reduce the headcount of the organization.  For many of our fellow workers today will be the last day at Aquila.  For those not released today, we will need to, as carefully and responsibly as possible, put our beloved company to bed.  At the end of this process, the remaining employees, as is true with me, will be let go. 

No one is to blame, it is just an unfortunate reality we have found ourselves in, and we are left with this ugly choice.  Please try to hold your head up, we have built a great company of talented, motivated, creative, and dedicated people.   Hold on to your integrity, respect yourself and each other, and remember what a team we have had.

We are collecting information to dispute Ercot's OOMC calculation.    OOMC has not had a defined clearing price due to the the non-functioning Replacement reserves mkt.
Ercot has asked us to file a dispute for each time that we were issued an OOMC.   I think that this goes back to Sept 14th.

Also at issue is the payment for the actual power once it is called for.    Ercot claims that OOMC means run, instead of standby.   So,  for the times that we were asked to run,  Ercot will only pay us the balancing energy price, versus the OOME heat rate calculation.

How far can we go back in a dispute?  I thought we were somewhat limited.

<NAME/>, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some items to consider,

	1.  Park balance on deal #1222  188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
	2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth
	3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
	4.  ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

<NAME/>, <NAME/> and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

<NAME/>, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did.

<NAME/>,
I have elected to stay in <NAME/> until at least February.  It is so late in the year,  that I may not be immediately effective in the West and I would have "lost" the first part of this year,  as I was training (myself).
There is a huge need for me here and I am trying to do what's right for both E and myself.    To that end,   <NAME/> <NAME/> has offered me an opportunity to trade around <NAME/>'s assets in Texas,   learning the term trading side of the business from <NAME/> <NAME/>-Smith.
Both <NAME/> and <NAME/> know my circumstances and their proposal gets me the experience that I need,  while they get my experience in Services,  training & managing a team and making money in a pool type market, as exists in Texas.

These opportunities were presented to me only after I stated emphatically that I was returning to Portland.   I would still like to live in Portland as early as February.    I realize that a seat wont be held open for anyone,  and I will revisit this issue in Feb.

This compromise seems reasonable.   I have asked that this be committed to writing,  so I am editing what <NAME/> has created concerning job responsibilities.

Additionally, most junior people are dissatisfied here and the bottom line reason:    they dont know how their job relates to the entire floor making money.
This explanation to them and an acknowledement of their contribution will bring the ideas forth from the "back corner."
The senior traders say aloud that they dont need anyone, and they will make their money with or without help.

A particular trader antagonizes until someone stands up to him,  then he has them sent home.     I think that there are three Real Timers at home at full pay right now.     One or two will be paid for two years, or so I'm told.   This type behavior is allowed as the trader makes a great amount of money for the company.   This is not an unusual occurence on trade floors,  but I will not be any part of it.

I am going to spend this time to try to make some difference in this culture.    If we dont get buy in from the top,  I will also be at risk of going home.    Some of these guys just dont get it.

There are, however,  many positives to staying here:  the guys I report to are like-minded concerning the above.   They are very competent and have a lot to teach & they are willing to teach.   I am excited about learning something new and also being able to lead a team.

Well,  thanks for listening to my sermon, sister <NAME/>.   My wife and I miss Portland and will probably be back next year.
Hopefully there will still be opportunity for me at that time.    If you have any thoughts or advice,  please share,  as I have alot of exposure this year, due to the move and subsequent reorg.   

Later,
<NAME/>

<NAME/> Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling <NAME/> Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with <NAME/> Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

<NAME/> will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per <NAME/> Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to <NAME/>, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before <NAME/> declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is <NAME/> <NAME/> (205-325-7696).  I left a message for <NAME/> to call me.

2/20/02
<NAME/> <NAME/> returned my call.  <NAME/> said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked <NAME/> if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  <NAME/> said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per <NAME/> Mann - <NAME/> Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for <NAME/> <NAME/> regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per <NAME/> - <NAME/> Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  <NAME/> Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per <NAME/> - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  <NAME/> called <NAME/> <NAME/> (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - <NAME/> said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  <NAME/> also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  <NAME/> Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  <NAME/> is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

By the way, <NAME/> made a Second Baptist comment to me yesterday when I was talking to <NAME/>.  I can't remember exactly what she said but I sure do wish you wouldn't tell her anymore STUFF about us.  I finally figured out that her and <NAME/> are very similar.  Information is power that they can share with others, even useless trivia information about friends.  I don't think either one of them mean any harm, they just can't keep their big mouths shut.

<NAME/>, 

I believe that <NAME/> was going to show EEX a bid with the understanding that any deals on HPL would go with the pipeline after the sale. We were working under the thought that we need continue to conduct business as usual for HPL until the sale is finalized. The HPL piece is just a portion of supply that we are bidding on, and <NAME/> was going to present them with bids for their total package (<NAME/> and HPL).  Let me know what you want to do. If you don't want to place a bid, I will pass that on.

Group-
Brace yourselves...
Once more we are experiencing seasonal changes. The time zone change has pushed the evening peak back to HE 18 through HE 19. These hours are now premium, the load curve no longer resembles a rolling hill but has an extreme morning ramp and an extreme evening ramp. Both EPE and the CAISO in NP-15 will have difficulty with this evening ramp. Do not count on the EPE load forecast to accurately identify the evening ramp. We should not suck off the grid. Pay the extra $3 for firm or unit contingent power in the SW. We need to attack the evening peak early and make sure we cover it. We should be using congestion wheels as hedges. A 200 mw import requires a 200 mw wheel going in the opposite direction at $0.10--or less--we should not do 50 mws at $50 as we would still have to pay $50 on the other 150 mws if we get awarded all 50 mws of relief. We will discuss this in our meeting next Tuesday November 6th at 4:30. Let's be sharp and not give away hard-earned revenue on congestion mis-management or poor scheduling.

Any questions? Comments? Ideas? Bring them to the meeting on next Tuesday.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

Here is the hedge summary for July 3/01.

Two things to note are: 	1) I bought 125 MW of Cal 02 flat from Mirant for a 10 GJ/MWh heat rate
			2) There is now a 20 year AECO basis curve, so the fixed price AECO gas from cal 15 on is generated off this curve.  Before the AECO basis
				curve stopped at Cal 14

<NAME/>,
Just a quick note regarding scheduling on Saturday.  There should be a 25 mw n-firm export for HE 7-10 and HE 13-22.  The schedule ID for HE 7-10 was CISO_EPMI_BUNNY.  The schedule ID for HE13-22 was EPMI_CISO_BUNNY.  For HE 11 and HE12, <NAME/> at the CISO misentered our schedule.  CAPS shows a final of 25 mws as a firm import.  This should be a n-firm export.  We recieved the energy as a firm export from the CISO.  All schedules should be under ECTSTSW not ECTRT.  If you have questions please let me know.

I'll have to decide next week what I want to feed you.  Of course you have a say, a small one anyway.

We are long 20 mws in SDG1 for HE 2 and HE 3. We are long 10 mws in SDG1 for HE 4 and HE 5. This cost us $7.50. We imported it from MEAD 230.
We are also long 10 mws in NP-15 for HE 7-22 at $25. This is from Redding.

Finally, ST-SW has extra transmission from PV to 4C and PV to Mead. You can query by <NAME/> Power Marketing on the APS site to see what we have already purchased. If you need this transmission off-peak please use what we have already purchased. We can go over the Enpower when I get in in the morning.

If I cannot answer the question,  then I will get an answer from our Ercot Rep.

The Ercot Settlement Statements have just arrived and we are breaking them down to ensure that they Protocols are being followed.
This is what is complicated as Ercot doesnt yet know their own rules.

<NAME/>,
I think you have identified the most pressing issues. Certainly the ability to go long or short into R/T will be important and hopefully the CISO will follow through on its efforts to "strive for simplicity and transparency." Any idea what the penalties for being long or short in R/T might be?  In the CISO's proposal the first two "goals" for the real time market appear to be at odds with each other. Also, I think we should push to rid ourselves of 10-minute dispatch at tie points. I understand the CAISO keeping the ADS in-state but it has not worked at tie-points. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for the update.

The U.S. needs to establish a very, very strong ground troop presence in Afghanistan as soon as possible. Until we accomplish this, we will not win over the Afghan people who would like to be rid of the Taliban. As of today, defection is very risky and maybe almost impossible. We need bases of operation in more than one area of the country. The logistics of feeding and sheltering and supplying these troops may be difficult but not impossible. The Afghan people need our support on the ground if they are going to rise up against the Taliban. 

We are currently losing the media war. If our ground troops were hailed as liberators by the Afghan people and that was broadcast all over the world, we would start winning the war of words. 

We must control ground very soon. There will be casualties on our side and the American people must prepare themselves mentally. We are fighting a ruthless, brutal enemy. Our resolve must increase, not diminish, when images of our casualties begin to come across our television screens. We must take down the Taliban and Bin Laden and other terrorists around the globe or face more attacks and loss of life in the United States.

Group,
As most of you are aware we changed time zones on Sunday. We are back in Pacific Standard Time. As such, we are once again in a different time zone than some of our counterparties. Please specify Pacific time zone in your summary of your deal at the end of each phone call--translate the deal to Mountain time only if necessary. We must be very clear on this going forward or disputes will be numerous and we will not be able to resolve them. See me if you have any questions regarding this expectation.

as for myself, i went back up to seattle last weekend for an interview with the other company i'd talked to up there.  they ended up offering the job so i'm in the process of deciding whether or not i want to take it...i have until the end of the month to make up my mind.  meanwhile, i'm checking out a bunch of other possibilities and seeing what turns up.  living at home has been interesting.  mom still insists on waking me up personally in the morning and harassing me at every turn.  still, the meals are great and it's kind of nice to be at home right now.

i'm flying to tennessee today to visit chuck and chris...i'm very excited to see their house and the area.  i'll be there through monday and then work on planning my next trip...ha.  also, some other exciting news - kathy and travis are pregnant with their third!!!  babies galore in the scott clan...that is, of course, except for me.

talk to you soon,
susan

the pictures you took were great...can't wait to see more.  take care.

Your numbers amount to a adjustment of (1,746,675), were the total 2nd order from Jun 29 was (1,891,851), now I understand that I would receive a some negative 2nd order to explain some of this difference I just thought that (145,176) difference (i.e. (1,891,851-1,746675) which should be the true 2nd order) was a bit high.

Corry,
Can you add me as a trader in Enpower under Ercot Asset?    Also,  please add Alex McElreath as a trader under Teco Services.
Additionally,   Alex is not able to get into Lotus Notes and, ultimately,   East Power Scheduling Discussion.  
<NAME/> Miller needs access to East Power discussion - he has Lotus Notes.

that are worth a look.  

<NAME/> Jenkins is a senior commercial person with extensive derivatives knowledge and industry experience.  She has 
a trading background but has interest in pursuing Origination opportunities also.
 


<NAME/> Versen worked for me most recently trading physical gas in 
the Gulf and previous scheduled on several East pipes.  I think she

<NAME/>,

I have been approached by 3 different groups regarding an HA or RT index in the West. I have decided against participating with TraderNews or PowerDex. I am considering participating with Dow Jones. I think a working index would help encourage liquidity through price discovery in real time. It should also provide an index to settle against financially for our desk and the Cash desks. I am working with <NAME/> and our developement group upstairs to get the tools in place to participate in the Dow Jones index. I am still waiting for the confidentiality agreements from DJ and will be sending them to <NAME/> Hall when they arrive. I have concerns that participating in this index may spread some of the value we obtain in making a market on EOL to our counterparties. I would appreciate your thoughts on this when you have an opportunity.

Thanks,

I'm not sure if it should be terminated but to my knowledge we are not serving this deal so it probably should be terminated.  I'm going to a "terminated contracts" meeting this morning so maybe I will find out more about how this works.  I also don't see any volumes on this deal for March.

<NAME/>, I talked with <NAME/> Miller and he confirmed that the Storage group sends 
	storage volumes to EIA for reporting purposes.  They do NOT send anything to
	AGA.  But it is his understanding that AGA is getting their information from EIA
	so by default he believes that AGA gets NNG's storage numbers.  As a reminder
	this question came up in the staff meeting this week and I was to follow up with <NAME/>.

	If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. <NAME/>

2) Marathon on Tejas is Galveston County.
Check with <NAME/> to make sure no one in his group has called the other pipes.  I f they haven't, you can look into the old scheduling contact list and call El Paso and Dow.  For El Paso Offshore, we probably need points, but I believe most of their system is in Matagorda County.

<NAME/>,
I spoke with <NAME/> directly about <NAME/>'s e-mail and concerns.    <NAME/> said that <NAME/> of C.O.B contacted him,  inquiring about job opportunities here.     <NAME/> did mention to <NAME/> that "someone" from their shop had already inquired.   He was not specific.    <NAME/>,  evidently,  figured who this was (not very hard)  and spread the word at the COB office.   Subsequently,   <NAME/> and <NAME/> sent their resumes.

I have spoken directly with <NAME/> about this issue.  I also have put out a note to the group which I copied you on.    Clearly,  this is unacceptable and <NAME/> has apologized.

How do you feel about this:   
if we hire <NAME/>,  then this problem somewhat goes away.    I need someone immediately and <NAME/> could be plugged right in,  similar to Alex.     I know that <NAME/> may not be a solid fit for the trader track program,  but I am needing some help pretty quick.

Let me know - sorry for the very awkward  situation.

Mr. Dossett,

I did not have your email address - however, I do recall inviting you verbally to the party, in person.  No one else on that distribution list received such an honor.  I am sorry you can't make it, as I know you have a black tie affair, however, there have been 12 girls who have accepted our invitation and only 3 guys.  Therefore, my party might have a better ratio for you.  Sorry you'll miss it!

And I have TN and 18 for a smoothie.  Think I'll win?

I know you are frustrated with the adherence to the VAR limits or lack there of, so I do not want to frustrate you more, but I would like you to consider the following suggestions.
	1)  It does not seem logical that the VAR limit between the Central, East and Texas Desk be so far apart.  Under the current limits the Central desk can have 			a position 2,000 Contracts larger than Texas and the East Desk 1,000 Contracts larger. 
	2)  When looking at performance YTD I wonder if higher VAR limits only gives the desks a greater ability to double down to try and make up the YTD losses.
			VAR LIMITS		DESK P/L
	   EAST	 	$10 MILLION		($66.1) MILLION
	   CENTRAL	$12 MILLION		($13.9) MILLION
	   TEXAS	$8  MILLION		$55.8   MILLION
	3)  It also bothers me that everyone else does not hold the VAR limits in as high regard as <NAME/> & I.  There are no consequences if the VAR limit is violated.  In fact 		in days like today you are rewarded for breaking the VAR limit. I feel that the following should be implemented in order to stress the importance of the VAR 		limit.
			The P/L for any desk exceeding the VAR Limit by more than $500,000 will be decreased each day by the amount they exceeded the VAR limit.
			(For example if a desks VAR limit is 10,000,000 and the VAR is $12,000,000 the P/L for the desk would be decreased by $2,000,000.  If the 				situation is not corrected by the next day the same procedure would be followed.)
		This method I believe makes for an even playing field.  Under the current procedures what I'm learning is if you ignore the VAR limits and you are right no 		one will remember at year end and you are rewarded for breaking the rules.  

Please give me your thoughts when you have a chance.

	Thanks,  <NAME/>

FYI,
This morning Ercot asked us to run all three units for a manual OOM.    Our Resource plan indicated that our total minimum was 220.    I believe that we had a discussion with Ercot indicating that our minimum on a 2 on 1 config was 280.    We ran at 280,  but our resource plan was not updated.     Ercot called mid-morning to say that they only wanted 220.   It is possible that we will be punished financially (receive the balancing energy price) for the 60 mw's over their request.

The point is,   the Resource Plan is the only thing binding.    We must reflect our true minimums at all times.    If the situation changes intraday,  we need to make changes in the resource plan to reflect what we can actually do.

We are missing an ID-S from ST-WBOM to ST-CALI for Saturday.  We sold 50 mws to ST-CALI at $42.89.  This should be the same as Friday's deal #683947.  We either need a new deal for Saturday or need to make Friday's on-peak deal carry over into Saturday.

If you are changing the Friday deal you need to do it before the flash, otherwise if you make a new deal for Saturday you should have some time.

Thanks for the help.

I'm using March pricing for TCO and Sonat.  For TCO, I'm using the financial basis offer for March provided by <NAME/> Junek at AES at 9:45 AM, $.125.  Sonat basis is not as liquid so I'm using the Inside Ferc differential for Feb 2002.  For Feb 2002, <NAME/> Hub is $2.03 and Sonat is $1.99, ($.04).  At 10:00 AM, NYMX for March 2002 is $2.36

TCO Value	$2.485 = $2.36 + $.125

Sonat Value	$2.32 = $2.36 + ($.04)

<NAME/> and <NAME/>, I reviewed our analysis of the swing for July 17th this morning in the meeting.  High level
	recap is:


		130,000		Due to building line pack from Monday's gas day
		 95,000		Day to Day payback and I/C shortages ( the bulk of this was to
					repay Norval and Valero Sprayberry about 60,000 from
					the previous day)

		140,000		Due to Market Area overtake (this includes 40,000 of Mid Am imbalance
					plus 100,000 spread over ABC, D and EF.  In looking at LSF, we
					were not able to determine that any one zone over pulled.  It looked
					to be pretty evenly distributed)

		 15,000		Due to 5% tolerance on Power packs.
		_______
		380,000		The total swing was 419,000.  The difference of 39,000 is a combination
					operational adjustments.

	Hopefully this helps to identify some of your concerns.  If you have any questions, please let me
	know.  Thanks. <NAME/>

We're still refining the post-Red <NAME/> regulatory rate base and won't know the offset until sometime tomorrow pm.  The same theory would apply to TW - if you don't collect a tax component, you would not have a rate base reduction for deferred taxes.  We should know by Friday morning what the net impact of eliminating the tax component and deferred taxes has on TW's rates.  I'm still not sure the tax component should be eliminated - <NAME/> to understand more after Monday's meeting with tax.

Group,

For those on night and day shift on Saturday/Sunday the emergency back-up generators will be tested. The testing will occur from 5 AM to 10 AM on Sunday morning. <NAME/> Steiner has assured me that RT will be unaffected and <NAME/> will be on hand to help if anything is needed. I think we should work to have everything submitted early to the CISO, tags made, etc. At least for HE 6, HE 7 and HE 8. This should give us some extra time if something goes wrong when they switch to the back-up power.

How are you today?
Things are OK down here!
Nothing really new since last night!

NYMEX went against me big time this morning so I decided to get flat.
That will mean a $1,000,000 loss today but I will still be positive for the month!
Its the little things that count, right!

They continue to hate ENE!
It really makes me wonder?

Be Safe!

Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to <NAME/> Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, <NAME/> <NAME/> (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  <NAME/> Vrana (713-752-4514) with <NAME/> <NAME/> is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  

Just spoke with <NAME/> (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing <NAME/> but he has worked with Harlam <NAME/>?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.

<NAME/>, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.

Attached is the action form HR has indicated we are to use for Level 3
	performer.  This form will be in addition to the PEP system Peformance
	review form.  In discussions with <NAME/> we will use the form for all
	Level 3, but ONLY input "target dates" for those employees with
	issues.


		 

	Thought I would pass it on and let you modify as you need for your reviews.

	If I have throughly confused you, give me a call.  Thanks. <NAME/>

Hi guys,

Attached is the swap picture we discussed.  I am working on some call prices as well and will send them asap.  Prices fell significantly today - probobly $.20 going one year out at the PG&E City gate.

Hi <NAME/>,


Here are some notional sales prices at the Chicago City gate starting with calendar year 2003.  Of course, these prices are probably already old, as the NYMEX went up a little this afternoon, but nevertheless, they should at least give you some idea.

I'll gladly update these prices for you whenever you give me the word (we can update them fairly quickly).

Year 2003			$.3.355

Year 2004			$3.45

Year 2005			$3.54

Year 2006			$3.62

Year 2007			$3.71

Year 2008			$3.81

As far as a publication such as PIRA, that <NAME/> would recommend, we really aren't comfortable making recommendations as such.

Regarding our electronic trading platform EnronOnline, I would like to spend a few minutes via the telephone, walking you through the steps to access that program (forms to be electronically completed).    I think you will enjoy having access to this tool, so let's set up a time.

P.S. Would you be trading under the entity, Corn Products, International, or another entity?  If it is Corn Products International, then we can proceed rather quickly.  I'd also like you to start looking at our ISDA agreements (International Swap Dealers Association), so that when you are in a position to trade financially, we have all the contracts in place.

Please reply when you have a moment.

As usual <NAME/>, I am left somewhat disturbed by your words...and by the way, do you ever return phone calls?  As for the rest of you guys, I anxiously await our impending reunion in Cap City.  Glad to hear everyone seems to be doing okay, with the exception of <NAME/> who appears to be suffering from a severe case of spring fever.  <NAME/> <NAME/>, went to an Astros game a couple weeks ago and saw your name on the scoreboard...it made me feel special.  The trader I work with, who was there with me, is a huge baseball fan and upon hearing I went to school with you has insisted upon checking your stats regularly...seems you're not doing to shabby.  Congrats.  Life for me is pretty good, although I'm in desperate need of a deep, drunken conversation regarding life and all it's complexities (I expect everyone to contribute to said discussion when we convene).  I'm sure I'm not the only one, but things just seem to be getting less certain the older I get.  <NAME/>'t want to get to heavy now...so I'll saw the really bleak stuff for <NAME/>.

Ciao,

Girl, so very sorry to hear about your relatives.  That is awful, such young people.  I will keep them and all of their their families in prayer.  If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.  If you need help with the kids or anything.

Also, sorry about the choir,  what's wrong with Doren, he's seems to be sick alot.  <NAME/> will probably "fire his ass" this week for messing up his "Big Day" on <NAME/>.  That's a shame!

You mean to tell me you wore the new dress without the blouse/jacket.  That is wonderful, I told you not to worry about your arms.  You did look real good in the dress, the colors were beautiful.
 We need to shop together more often.

Yes, I will be at choir tonight.

See you then!

I've got an opinion now...I think we should fly into Brescia (Italy).  We could fly in and cab it to Brenzone.  It's on one of those amazing lakes in northern Italy (Lago di Garda).  You can go to Gardaworld.com and then just click on photo gallery and Brenzone to see what it looks like...absolutely amazing.  It would be a fantastic trip in my opinion - Lots of great wine.  Plus, you can be the exchange rate from Pounds or Dollars to Lire.

I entered a deal to buy 25 mws from MWD at the contract price ($113.00) deal #882054, and a deal to sell to Calpine to capture LD's ($113.00) deal #882064.

Sorry I was in such a funk last night, I'm not really sure why but I assume it will pass soon.  Anyway, got an email from <NAME/> this morning and she said another trip should be planned to go over in Sept/Oct when the airfares are dirt cheap.  I'm guessing I'll probably be up for going again by that time if you don't mind waiting that long.  My guess is we could get tickets for somewhere around $350 or $400.  I think I found a flight for June (probably the 5th - 12th), but I'm going to end up spending somewhere around $600.  Let me know what you think.

On Nov 13th, I sold 2700 dth to Black Hills in Tenn Z6 for the 13th.  I bought the gas from Hodge on CNG.  I need to know where the gas is if it didn't get delivered to Tenn.  The deal ticket shows that I changed added the deal at 8:50 am.  The volumes must have been in Sitara because Sitara shows <NAME/> changing the volume from 14085 to 11348 on the 14th?  Then it shows me changing the volume back on the 14th.

<NAME/>, would you see if we even nominated the intraday on the 13th to Black Hills?

thanks

My mom told me about Tootsie when we got home...I am so sorry.  I know how much those dogs mean to you...as do most Londoners based on the picture arsenal.  Anyway, I'm sure the funk will last for a while, but eventually you'll start to feel better.

Group,

We are lending from El Paso Electric on Monday. We have sold 15 mws for HE 7-22 to ST-SW at $62.50.  We are paying El Paso $4 for the service to lend from their system.   The sell to ST-SW is under the ST-WBOM book (#696314), the purchase from EPE is also under the WBOM book (deal #696315-note the price will be changed to $4 on Monday from $56).  Please buy energy to cover this 15 mw short on Monday under the ST-WBOM book and sell to EPE at $0 under the ST-WBOM book.  The deal is physically prescheduled going out from EPE.  We need to schedule the 15 mw going to EPE.  Please do NOT buy from EPE in the morning even though they may be fat.  We are hoping to do more lending with EPE going forward and therefore need to make this as easy as possible for their dispatchers (do not bring up lending to them-it will lead to unnecessary confusion).  If you have any questions concerning this procedure please call me. 503-887-3449 (c) or 503-274-0502 (h).

Thanks,
<NAME/>

Day ahead only?

How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 

Is this a gas only facility? 

How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?

Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?

Thanks,

You can find HE 10 through 18 at the bottom of the November Service Sheet. This should be in the same location as the Trading sheet in the Inc sheet section. My understanding is that you were given a copy of the service sheet with the trading sheet yesterday morning. You should find probably another $60,000 maybe $70,000 at the bottom of the sheet. If you have any questions just let me know.

The two attachments show all the contracts that are active for ENA per Columbia's system effective 12/01/2001 and 06/01/2002.  This might be handy to have when we talk to <NAME/> today.  The file name tells you what effective date I used on the report.  The effective date is also shown in the upper right part of the report as well.  The column in the far left indicates which pipeline the contract is for; TCO is Columbia Gas and CGT is Columbia Gulf.



 


 

The attachments below show all the active contracts for Columbia Energy Services (CES) and Columbia Gas Marketing (CGM) for the same time frame.  ENA is agent for both of these companies.

Hi <NAME/>,

How are you doing?  <NAME/> said you'd broken your foot recently and have been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're riding public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might have some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.  One of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to live in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of a research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions for restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

Thanks a bunch,
<NAME/>

The Oklaunion plant is offline until midnight Friday.    I have replaced the power for this deal in the cash market.   
No replacement is needed.
Also;
You will notice that from peak on through 24, the pool has been strong.     Generators are taking their units offline for offpeak and are running short until peak the next day.
You can recognize this in the ACE display on the monitor.   Notice hour ending 3,4,5.   Theyre draggin.
Prices still havent done much in the offpeak,even with this going on.

Hi <NAME/>,

Thanks for resending the message.  I shouldn't have too much difficulty arranging travel, but I wanted to run a few things by you first.  It seems to me that it would be preferable to fly in Thursday evening, therefore freeing myself up to come in Friday at whatever time of day best suits yourself and the rest of the group.  If no one minds, it might even be nice to see some of the activity on the desk during cash trading.  Also, I anticipate staying through the weekend to see a bit more of the city and surrounding areas, but plan to cover those expenses myself.  If all of this is acceptable to you just let me know and I will begin making all of the necessary reservations.  I look forward to seeing you and meeting the rest of the group.

If you need to contact me for any reason, my mobile is the most reliable way to reach me...713-775-6472.

Thanks again,
<NAME/> <NAME/>

Vin:

The balance in my 401K plan is $547,038 in the Stable Asset Acct.  There is around $200 in ENE and $200 in one of the other funds.  How I got that who know!
Esop is around $105.  The majority has been transferred to my IRA's over the years.
Cash Balance Plan would not allow me access today!  I think it is around $35,000.  I believe <NAME/> should have a copy of my last statement (June 30, 2001)

I hope this is what you were looking for?

Save the file attached below to your desktop.    You can just click and drag.

You can view the data by interval or by hourly average.     Make sure that the dates are in the following:
10/25/01
10/26/01

To view today (10/25) make sure the ending date is tomorrow to pull in he 2400.


The purpose of this toy is to paint certain blocks,  ie 14-22 and get an average in the excel format.   I have found this to be a quick and easy to use tool.
I used a similar tool in the California pool.    For example,  take yesterday and compare to today, same period.   Factor in weather,  unit outages, etc.

This should give you a general idea of where prices should be for these hours.

Let me know your feedback.

I have now barred myself from any sort of contest with Bass (they always turn ugly) and have instituted a personal limit for myself.

When doing allocation process and we allocate points or groups on the Timely, Evening, or Non-Grid. 
We allocate with the capacities that are loaded from CAS.  When allocating points or groups that have
not previously been allocated on any of the previous cycles during ID-1 or ID-2 we need to use the flow rate calculation.
.
Example :  Allocations are as follows

The only point to be exempt from this method should be Socal Needles because of their window issue
Timely:        M/L Thoreau West System                1093.000  (capacity)
                   I/B Link                                             700.000  (capacity)
                   Laplata/<NAME/>                                  500.000  (capacity)
                   Socal Needles                                   775.000  (Window)
Evening:      Same sequence 
Non-Grid:     Same sequence

ID-1or ID-2:  Same sequence shows up to be allocated.  
                   Since they were previously allocated on the earlier cycles we do not need to right mouse 
                   click and calculate flow and update capacity based on flow rate.  The only time we should 
                   have to calculate flow rate is when there is a new point or group shows up that has not been previously
                   allocated.                   
             
 The reason for the change is we have recieved more FERC data requests on capacities and scheduled volumes.
lets try this for a while and see how it is working.

Juanster,
Can I get a copy of your group's expectations?    I need to also discuss with you the duties of all the night guys.    As I understand it,     they  all pitch in to do confirms and they unofficially cross-train in other regions.     What about reconciliation reports - what is required?   What other reports need to be tied out -  the Sched Activity report vs. the P&L sheet?

My typing is so poor and slow or else a book would surely follow.  Upon <NAME/>'s return we shall revisit the thorny WSPP meeting in Colorado in the modern way, by phone for lack of my speed and agility.  (CY - I think we were starting to recap the absurdity when <NAME/> Skilling suddenly resigned).  But in the meanwhile a preview.

The EEI creep was evident when <NAME/> Small after himself, personally,  taking credit for drafting <NAME/>'s market disruption language (he said it was very time consuming to draft) proceeded to be challenged by all the EEI members who the day before had sat around the table for 2 productive hours challenging certain concepts that <NAME/> originally proposed (as a result we will be modifying our language soon since some good issues were raised).  After hearing the new issues <NAME/> threw up his arms and asked that we propose new language.  Afterwards, I spoke with <NAME/>, sorry <NAME/>, and proposed to meet with him to discuss the possibility of bringing the groups together, using the absurdity of the market disruption language discussion as good evidence of what we could achieve together.  He said theoretically that might be able to happen but he never saw it happening.  I asked why.  He said too painful.  What pain.  He said <NAME/> Stack.  I said one bad day in Newport.  He stopped talking.  He did ask if we wouldn't sit down with him and tell him line by line why we don't like the WSPP. , I think this meager offer is something we can't miss so ....  Maybe, at this meeting, <NAME/> and others can begin the writing of a world of one, a world where <NAME/> can make yet another name for himself.

Well, I think I managed to adequately disturb her yesterday.  Not only did I go to the Menil collection by myself (can you imagine?)...I also went to berryhill and ate dinner solo.  When I got back to the apartment she said I should've called and she would've met me for eats.  My immediate response, "Actually, I needed some solo time."  Subject closed.  As for the lease, brought up the subject and it went pretty much no where.  Discovered we could sign a year lease and if she decides to up and go I can move into a one bedroom if I give the complex 30 days notice...which is what I'm figuring we'll end up doing.  I also told her that I got my airplane ticket through council travel on British Airways leaving the 5th and returning the 12th (via email yesterday) and she didn't mention it last night.  Who knows?  I'm not going to mention it anymore, it's up to her.  And ditto on the witty repartee.

<NAME/>,
Per our discussion, please allocate all Hour-Ahead Congestion charges or revenues to the ECTRT group. Hopefully this will simplify the management of our books. My understanding is that <NAME/> will tell RT if there are cuts or some other need to put in Hour Ahead (24) schedules for the Cali desk and will allow us to allocate approriate charges or revenue to him if necessary. All Congestion charges/revenue at tie points should still be allocated to the desk entered in CAPS. If you have any questions please see me. RealTime will still try to notify you of Congestion revenue or charges.

I never know what contract the deal is under but I can confirm the price and the volumes for the following;

Deal	 	Counterparty					Comment
1192958	Sequent Energy Management, LP 		approved
1198866	Anadarko Energy Services Company		approved
1195770	MidAmerican Energy Company			approved
1195777	MidAmerican Energy Company			Changed price from $2.05 to $2.02 in Sitara per notes from <NAME/> Pollan.
1195767	MidAmerican Energy Company			approved
1192959	City of Tallahassee				this should be on deal #30534 - part of the long term contract.

I don't have access to view the other deals but I'm working on it.  I believe I entered the other 2 Anadarko deals in Sitara but either I put them on the wrong desk or they were moved after I entered them because I don't have access to them either. GRRRR.

<NAME/>, <NAME/>, I changed the price on deal 1195777 (Feb 2002 activity) from $2.05 to $2.02.  We prepaid MidAmerican $1,158,864.00 for all 3 deals shown above.  Not sure who to tell about Sitara changes.

223854		9189	Sale		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England

415547		9000	Buy		Nful Niagara	10/31/2002	East TP1
415547		6000	Buy		Nful Leidy	10/31/2002	East TP1
1131708	6000	Sale		Nful Leidy	10/31/2008	East TP1

When this deal was done 2 years ago, AEC agreed to give <NAME/> the NFUL transport (I don't know who at <NAME/> agreed to this).  <NAME/> pays NFUL max demand for the space.  I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy price, and part of it should be adjusted for demand, commodity, and fuel.  Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth ( = 9189 at Niagara).


Kam, I'm not sure which firm book this is in.  Over the last few months, I would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 (or TP3).  As TP1, I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price.  I also created deal 1147662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara.

Also, I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 years of this deal.  That's around $1,340,000.  I'm sure AEC is not expecting that.  Does anyone here talk to AEC?

Her ETA as of this morning is this afternoon.  Basically, jay is ok with using the GISB for up to three months if Stacy is ok with it.  He said that he would require a master for a 6 month transaction or longer.

Attached is the draft incorporating issues as agreed.  You should also be aware of changes I have redlined to sections 4.2, 4.6, and the Material Adverse Change in the Appendix.  These revisions concern credit terms.  As the original draft in its inception was created for  Enerchange Energy, L.L.C. the credit terms differ slightly from those for Nicor Energy, L.L.C. Finally,  I  await a response from Dynegy regarding the guaranty.

Group,
We have had some problems recently with the creation of HA finals, with SQL errors, and as a result we have not been able to run reports. If it is a weekend (or holiday), we first need to import DA finals and then create DA finals in CAPS. After this is done we can import HA finals, and create the HA report. If the boxes are not checked, the CISO may have missed publishing certain hours. Please look in the load zones to find what hour-ahead finals may not have been published, or where CAPS may have just missed pulling them in. Sometimes it helps to pull the missing hour-ahead finals in individually. Once all the finals are in the load zones and int. interchanges, you should be able to create the final report. Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

this is what I expect to be paid out next Tuesday


I'm buying all the baseload gas from Reliant 

Tallahassee 	10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $3.57 = $1,106,700

MCV		6,800 dth per day x 31 days x $3.57 = $752,556

I will probably pay NX1 + .05 or so for the Tallahassee gas because I'm buying point specific gas and NX1 flat to -.02 for the Trunkline.  I would prefer to be conservative so bump the prices up as you see fit.

<NAME/>:

Assuming you can get comfortable with a percentage MMBtu enhancement from someone like <NAME/> <NAME/> (the only one I would trust) I would suggest a method that would reflect more than the spread.  The way I look at this is that the liquids that are picked up in the gas stream as you withdraw from storage is an unaccounted for gain.  As such, if the MMBtu enhancement percentage was 1% I would use a withdrawal volume of 101% of the injection volume.  We have to realize that in order to recognize this in the real world, the Accounting Group would have to implement Accounting procedures that would try to capture this value also.  Because under normal Accounting procedures for storage, barring completely emptying the facility of gas before refilling, this gain would merely remain in the ground with the remaining inventory.  Accounting would have to recognize the difference between the MMBtu factor on the gas withdrawn and the average MMBtu factor of the gas injected as a gain.  We still need to live within the physical capacity constraints This method more appropriately represents what you are gaining but increases your risk if the MMBtu enhancement percentage you use is too high!  I would appreciate being kept informed of what MMBtu enhancement percentage is used and how it is put in the model.

I have attached a revised schedule per our conversation this a.m.  My options guy has done more research (at my insistence) to determine why our offers for the  5 days are of our sync....so giving me feedback does help me to get the "boys in line".  He has lowered his price by $0.31 so far.  I'll keep pushing!  

Please let me know how the 10 day option for Dec-Feb at the gate sounds.

The difference between your price indications and EOL are twofold.  One, we are showing you physical markets on the price indications and EOL is strickly financial and for a specific product.  There are many differences in these two products, depending on term, physical premiums, the trader's position, etc.  Two, the price indications that you receive are based on yesterday's markets.  EOL is a real time current market price for the specific product listed.  Give me a call if you have any more questions and we can discuss further.

Guys,
You can find out the information you need on the website.
The website is www.wscc.com, click on certification and training, scroll down to the Schedulers Course manual.  Print off the schedulers course manual and study it.  You will be tested on the material, a pre-test and a post-test. (note:you will need to access the site in Explorer to get the manuals).  You can call telephone# 801-582-0353 to get information on the scheduler's course (this is the main-line to WSCC so you will have to ask around a bit).

Please arrange for those on night shift to get in about 15-25 minutes early so you can leave at 5:10 on the 13th.

<NAME/>,
For September 28th,  we have sold a financial swap to Frontera for hours ending 7- 11.   We bill them $20,  Enpower #794481,  for various hours.
I will take the floating imbalance price for the following megawatt totals :

he7 - 310 mw's
he8 - 310 
he 9- 240
he10 - 140
he 11 - 60

Frontera will be running a resource imbalance for these hours.  (see imbal.  # 794516).       I should be allocated the imbalance charges as listed above and Frontera is responsible for any remaining imbalance for this day..
This is a financial swap that we will be offering our customers and I need your feedback on any requirements that you have in settling this product.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

Group,

We are starting to see some market changes as we transition into the winter months.

First:
With EPE we will start seeing a severe morning ramp. We will have to carefully manage the units to prevent "swinging" them and increasing the chance of a unit outage. As the EPE loads plummet off-peak, we should consult the unit commitment, and depending on market conditions look to take units off-line and/ or put units on manual and buy energy back. Recently we have sold energy from EPE at a loss rather than putting costly gas turbines on manual (Newman 1, 2 and 3), reducing them, and buying that energy less expensively in the market. Our relationship with EPE is at a critical stage, they have a new vice-president and will be hiring new management to lead their marketing group. We would like to be a part of EPE's marketing effort going forward, but need to continue to prove that our level of service cannot be matched either in-house or by other marketers. I look to each member of the group to be a part of this effort and to work closely to run the EPE grid as efficiently as possible.

Second:
The morning ramp will soon be upon us in the Northwest. It will become very difficult to get energy in the Nortwest for HE 6 through HE 10. We should look for congestion possibly on the COI and the DC. Also, as lights and heaters come on in the evening, there should be another jump in load at HE 18 through HE 20. <NAME/> Calgary will also be looking for energy these hours. Be sure to take this load movement into consideration if you lock a price in with ECC.

Finally:
We will have a meeting on TUESDAY--November 6th at 4:30 in the afternoon--(the first Tuesday as usual) to discuss market changes, peformance reviews and the final two months of the year.

Please see me with any questions regarding the system.

Thank you.

<NAME/>

Hi <NAME/>,

I'm still tracking down the Crestar issue, but at this time, it appears as though we should not have changed the name to Gulf Canada until recently when the sharing mechanism came into play with BP for the AOS.  Crestar confirmed this and <NAME/> Hyval left me a voice mail alluding to thus, but I need to hear back from him to ask that direct question.  I'll be back in touch, hopefully this afternoon.

I am working with Panda Resources to potentially supply gas to a couple of their Arizona facilities.  However, they say they have a plant coming online March 1st in El dorado, Ark.  They looking for TX Gas for Mar - jun and Tn zone 0 starting July 1.  She has gone over the structures that she is looking for.

J.,  Sorry, I sent the other email before I got this one.  The contact that I would recommend at NCPA is <NAME/> Park, 916-781-4224.  He will either help you or can direct you to someone else.  You can reference the RFP if you would like.

You are right, NCPA is a consorsium of Munis.  The ones that would be involved in this particular transaction would be the Cities of Roseville, Lodi, Lompoc, and Alameda.
The transaction would be a physical basis transaction for 5000/day at city gate for 2002-2004.  We would be buying back $3.37 Physical BASIS for 2002.  This would be a sort of blend and extend.

Our deal would be Physical Basis.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

<NAME/> Stonestreet at CGAS did verify that metered production on CGAS is "attached" to the AS (aggregation service) contracts, and from there you would schedule it to a transport contract or into the IPP contract.  CGAS and Dominion work very similar when talking about metered production.

Attached is a term sheet describing our proposal for September.  The changes are highlighted in yellow.  One of the things you guys might be interested in looking at long term is extending the current fixed price deals that you have and blending the price.  Another is a peaking option or cap.  We can talk about these things on the phone.
Give me a call when you have a chance to review the term sheet and let me know what you guys want to do.

<NAME/>,
<NAME/> all is well in Taylor.    I have a couple of questions about OOMC capacity payments.    As discussed in our meeting,  I received a manual OOMC on Thursday 9/13 (10:30 pm)  from Terry at the ISO.
He reserved 220 mw of capacity from the Frontera unti for hours ending 9-2400 for Friday,  Sept 14th.

We were,  indeed,   exercised on Friday.    I think that we understand the payment for the energy portion of the exercise.

However,  we are not certain what we will be paid for the capacity portion,  as the formula for OOMC payment is based upon the Replacement reserve market.
The replacement reserve prices have been zero.

Could you provide some help on this?

Thanks,

J Forney

All deals were originally sourced under ST-NW. Revenue was moved from ST-NW to ST-Whourly for 70/30 split between LP and ST-Whourly.

Annuity to ST-Whourly from ST-NW #531524--$23468.76

Annuity from ST-Whourly to LP #531549--$12597.73

Annuity from ST-Whourly to LT-NW #531546--$5472--this compensated for original deal sold to LP (take or pay).

ST-Whourly kept the difference between #531524 and #'s 531549, 531546.

All deals were originally sourced under ST-NW.

good luck w/ the car shopping!!!  i'm anxious to hear what transpires...

as for me, i was off last night and maybe if we have some time this weekend i can fill you in on what's happened to me over the course of this week.  but the bright spot in the whole thing is that dinner last night reminded me of the person i've been and how far i've come in the last 10 or so years of my life...and i think it gave me the extra shove, push or whatever you want to call it to really end the rotten situation i've been mired in.  i don't know that the dinner was to blame completely for my sudden "illness", b/c a large portion of it may have been psychological...i had an appointment for a final chat last night, and i think i was getting sick just thinking about doing what i had to do...but i did it, on my terms and there weren't any warm fuzzies or expressions of disappointment on my part and i rejected his suggestion of a shift to friendship....so there it is, now it just up to me to "stay sober" so to speak and kick the habit for good.

The opportunity here has been enhanced;   in addition to Managing RT,   I would be managing all of the Service Assets in Texas.   This includes trading around a 500 mw plant,   serving EES and New Power Company loads,  and also the potential for managing a new 1500 mw full requirements deal. 
Of course,  I would have to have all of this in writing.      I would be working with the Texas Term trader to enhance my trading skills in order to effectively manage this position.
This makes the offer more attractive,  but still I would be in <NAME/>.      I am still apprehensive of the bait & switch exposure.

Please note that when you start/stop a schedule to or from the following control areas,  the listed static scheduling fee applies.   

Reliant/HLP  - $49
TNMP  - $55
COA   -  $40
BEC  - $25


For example,  if we schedule for one hour from BEC>COA,   the one-time charge for scheduling alone would be a flat  $65.      Also applicable would be the per mw  line losses and the wheeling fee of $.22  .    
Please account for all such charges in the P&L report.

We are short on the offpeak for the three days including saturday,  sunday,  and monday.     We are floating 55 mw's   in the South zone.
If you replace this power,  please remove the appropriate counterparty in the portal and replace with new counterparty.

Also:

The Frontera plant is currently NOT scheduled to run this weekend or Monday.    We are currently,  as of Friday,  experiencing problems with units #2 & #3.  These tripped offline when a breaker problem on CPL's side occurred.
We have been asked by Ercot to reflect in the Resource Plan that unit #1 is available but offline.   We have done so.  When the other units become available,   please update them as available in the Resource Plan for the remaining hours of Saturday.    We should make sure that we have OOM premiums (up and down) and zero mw's scheduled.

If you have questions,   give me a call.

Group,

A quick reminder. The cell phones are for group member to group member usage.  As such, calling between group members, and our 1-800-684-1336 number is free.  We have 200 minutes each for use in calling other members of the West Desk on work related matters.  Over the past two months we have greatly exceeded our allowable minutes per month.  Some members of the group have exceeded their allotment by over 200 minutes per month!    Group member to group member usage is approximately 45-90 minutes per month-and this is not calculated in the minutes used.  If you want to use this phone as your only phone, let me know, and we will work out a calling and billing plan for you. 

Thank you,
B

Should we be talking about make up when we are allocating Belleville?  I had a question from Alliant,
	"You, NNG and ANR both have room to deliver gas to ANR, even though you are doing an allocation,
	why can't you schedule more delivery at ANR?  Wouldn't that help the system?"  I think it would be
	hard to explain that we are doing make up, allocating and NOT letting a shipper increase deliveries all
	at the same time.  What do you guys think?  Thanks. <NAME/>

Just a quick note to acknowledge the great job that Geir Solberg did in helping our office out during Tropical storm <NAME/>.
Our phone lines, computers and cell phones were down.    Additionally,   we were short staffed due to floodwaters downtown.

One of our service customers,  Teco,  wanted to sell some test power in South Texas.   Geir was contacted via satellite phone.
He sold 230 megawatts each hour to AEP.   He used the proper terminology unique to Ercot and sold the energy at a decent price.
He maintained good,  detailed notes and was able to relay this information to me the following Monday.    
Most importantly,  this was a seamless transaction to the customer.

Again,  thanks for the help.

The email was titled "nothing bad..." so you wouldn't immediately trash it for fear I was dispensing some more of <NAME/>'s homespun wisdom.  I know you can't get enough of that stuff.  As for the revenue generation, I've heard what a boon the Ag group has been to EGM.  From what I understand you guys are carrying the rest of that company on your backs...keep up the good work!  And yes, the world you live in does revolve around you <NAME/>, it's just that no one else lives in that world besides you so it stands to reason that would be the case.  Your welcome for the email.  I really am happy for you that things seem to be going well and that you appear to be enjoying what you're doing (I haven't heard any of the "when I grow up I want to be a ....." comments out of you in a while, a sure sign of contentment and maturity - okay burgeoning maturity).  In regards to trading, I am absolutely loving it.  I've been on EOL for a little over a month now (although my trades go into one of the other trader's books for the time being...I should get my own in a couple months) and am really enjoying the new life/perks this job allows.  Case in point, took my Mom to see <NAME/>'s last game with the Rockets on one of the brokers (center court seats...she was thrilled) and am off to Vegas this weekend to "meet" with some of the power traders from Portland.  So much for the 16-18 hour days I was dealing with for a year or so there...given present circumstances it was all worth it.

No need to "let me of the hook" for my candor last night, I meant everything I said and I wanted you to hear those things.  In a quest to be an oh so witty smart-ass, sometimes I forget to just tell people what I think/feel...always catches up to me in hind-sight and if the opportunity presents itself for me to rectify that then I don't believe in passing it up.  Contrary to what you may think, I'm a big girl who thinks for herself and always acts on her own volition.  And I think I either mumbled last night or your hearing is starting to go in your old age, but I said "clod" not "god"...subtle but important difference.

- You missed an impressive dancing display at <NAME/>'s last night...I think I may have frightened some people.

<NAME/>,
Good questions:
1. You are fine using Ercot System as the delivery opint until the Ercot ISO opens on July 20th.    Subsequent to that, we will enter the appropriate zone for each purchase or sale as West, North or South Zone.       If we wish to schedule mw's across a path,  ie South to North,  we will need to create an Ercot transmission deal to link south>north.     We do not actually do an Ercot Oasis, etc, to buy this transmission,  rather,  this is a way to reflect the desired pathing internally.
Risk Management is creating this internal transmission counterparty for us.  I will let you know what it is called.

2.  The positions that we manage for Frontera/Teco Services should not be reflected in the P&L sheet, as we had been doing.
My fault for not knowing the process as agreed to previously with Settlements & Risk Mgmt.    We are to keep these deals in the Services P&L sheet,  as Real Time has done for MDEA.     
The location for this spreadsheet is:

M:Eservices/applications/services

We will request access to this tool for everyone.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

Group,
We will be performing a new service for EES. On Monday, August 6th the ST-CALI desk will have submitted ancillary service bids to the CAISO for EES load.  LADWP will be providing the capacity (SPIN), we will be dispatched over the ADS system, and then need to call the amount into LADWP.  We need to keep track of the amount exercised.  We should do this in the Service Sheet and then record the amount dispatched on the sheet to EES on Tuesday morning as well.  The tags are in the front of the services book for Monday.  The shape is as follows.

Time			Volume			Tie Point     		Type
HE 7			6 MW			LA4-VictorvilleLugo	Spin
HE 8			6 MW			LA4-VictorvilleLugo	Spin
HE 9			6 MW			LA4-VictorvilleLugo	Spin

Sunil,
Per our conversation on the phone. We are getting several requests from customers to allow them to "personalize" their quotes to only include hourly EOL products. We are currently trading physical firm power at NP-15, SP-15, PV, and Mid-C for hours ending 12-20. A same day filter or hourly product filter would work nicely.
Please let me know what you might need from me to get this accomplished as quickly as possible.
Thanks,
</body>

Once again , the EOL report is ignoring the new customer list that I have given twice now.  They seem to insist that the the Canadian subs that are now tradinig <NAME/> power that have traded other products on EOL are not new customers. I have all but given up on this issue.

In terms on of # of trades/day for <NAME/> Power, the numbers for Aug and Sep are low:

August is 24 trades/day not 22 trades/day
Sep is 13 trades/day not 8 trades/day

I will check the gas info later

<NAME/>,
que paso,   juaro?    
<NAME/> passed on your e-mail.   Too bad about the beetles.   Is that the Taylor High School Mascot?   "Taylor,  home of the fighting beetles,"....  Go beetles!
I think you are right about Ercot being difficult to set up,  but it just reemphasizes the need for you;    they need an organizer and this situation fits your strengths.
Well,  enough about you,  let's talk about me..............
the Entergy gig was made more difficult,  as I received NO training in cash trading.     After a couple of months,  a coworker took me in and gave me some pointers on hedging,  which is especially important in my region.   The month of May was very profitable,  finally,  and things were coming together until..........

(Please keep this confidential)
Presto called me in to tell me that I was moving to Ercot as Manager of the Real Time group,  his decision being final,  no negotiations.  (thanks for your understanding, bunghole).
I had previously turned down several attempts to bring me back to Texas in this capacity and I expressed that I was less than happy with his decision.
I think that Ercot will be busy and a worthwhile region to be involved with,  given that we have retail load to service,  etc.   However,   thats not the job that I agreed to move 3000 miles for.   I suspect other changes would ensue,  once I established this region.

So.     It looks like I will be returning to Portland.    We bought a new house here and are very happy with everything,  except my job (which is a huge thing).
I may be working West Mid Mkt SW or doing something with the Service Desk.    I dont mind doing anything as long as it's productive.     
Anyway,  I was pissed in the beginning,  but I had to take time to digest this,  analyze the opportunity and make an informed unemotional decision.   
I am too deep in the (out of the money)   options to cut and run,  so it now boils down to where do I want to live.   There is interest outside of the company  in me,  but I am under contract.    I miss Portland and I think about it all the time.     I must be a mountain man at heart.

Well,  let me know if you have any thoughts on the above.   Once again,   I dont wish to have this get out to anyone on the West desk,  just yet.
I heard that you did really well on your home sale.    That's awesome.    Maybe I can buy back my house and my boat.  (just kidding).
I am actually more concerned about buying another boat than I am a house.   How is your housing in Taylor?
I miss the beer in PDX, boating and the winter bowling.   It is freaking hot here in Texas!

Anyway,  keep kicking butt and keep those Texans in line!

<NAME/>,
<NAME/> everything is going well with you.   I dont know if <NAME/> has talked with you, but I am considering returning to Portland.  
I am talking with Wolfe and <NAME/>,  but I would like to keep things low key.    I know this all seems pretty weird,   but my situation has changed so drastically that I have some major,  immediate decisions to make.    Basically,   the East Desk wants me to build a team in Real <NAME/>e,  similar to how we did it in Portland.
Unfortunately,  that was not the job I agreed to take (always get it in writing - I never could).     Had I known that it was a similar position to what I had,  I never would have left.

Anyway,  <NAME/> Melodick wants me to consider opportunities within <NAME/> <NAME/> and I have agreed to give her a week to see if a fit exists.   She is easy to work with and is being very helpful.    However,  I have expressed  to <NAME/> and <NAME/> that my first preference would be to return to Portland.

I have given this some thought and believe that taking the Real Time position would not be a good move for me, given the atmosphere here.   
 I would like to have a new perspective on this if you have time to converse.     I would appreciate any feedback that you can give me.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

In an effort to make sure that I am adequately prepared for my interview, I wanted to touch base with you and confirm that I possess all the necessary information and forms.  Last week I received the packet you had mailed containing the application form and company information.  Also, I have confirmed my flights, hotel arrangements and the directions to your facilities with <NAME/> Roberts.  I assume all the information needed prior to my arrival is already in my possession, if you know of any additional information I may need please let me know.  The last area of interest I am hoping to address is the actual interview schedule.  If it is possible at this point in time, I would appreciate the chance to preview the individuals with whom I will be meeting.  If the interviews have not been completely arranged as of yet then simply disregard the last request.  I look forward to meeting and speaking with you tomorrow.

Thank you,

The customer has called again on Friday, and I would like to get this thing resolved.  Please work with me on this issue.  I'm not sure what Enerson's role is anymore, but we need "all hands on deck" to get this issue ironed out immediately.

My cell # is 713-851-6240 and you may call me anytime.  I'll be visiting customers, but please call and leave a message if I'm not available.

Mirant had a problem with an EOL transaction where I bought 5,000 from then at $5.10 for the 1st and 2nd.  I agreed to let them out of the deal.  Due to legal problems with killing or adjusting EOL tickets, I entered a sale (#705989) to balance the volume and price out.  The two deals should be netted.  We should not have paid the purchase at 5.10.

You still interested in going to the Firehouse on tomorrow night?  I just checked my messages at home and <NAME/> called last night...at 9:45!  I was already passed out.  I know I'm an old bitty, but that is just too late to be calling a working girl when you're looking for a date Wednesday or Thursday night.  Anyway, I will give him a call this afternoon but I might suggest we just do something when he gets back from his trip.  I talked to <NAME/> last night (before he'd called) and told her about the firehouse...she's definitely interested.  Let me know what you think.

<NAME/>,

Sorry for the delay in getting you my accomplishments.  I filled out the self-evaluation portion of the PRC back in May.  I have attached my responses to the self-evaluation form.
My accomplishments and more long-winded descriptions of what I do are in the attachment, by comparison my near-term goals for the next 6 months are pretty concise.

1. Continue to maximize the abilities of the group, and try to leave nothing on the table.
2. Minimize our settlements and disputes over Enpower mistakes, or other avoidable actions.
3. Continue to provide those in the group opportunities to improve themselves and get where they want to go in <NAME/>.
4. Stay ahead of California with regards to political, legal and credit risk.
5. Work with middle-marketing and services groups to develop new opportunities.
6. Improve my education through SQL training and more advanced Derivatives training to better allow me to understand the fundamentals of the market and the movements of spreads relative to market fundamentals.

I greatly enjoy my current position and look forward to the next 6 months.

If you have any questions just let me know.
Thanks,

I spoke to the guys in the field last week when our deliveries went up and we made the decision to run
the pigs.  It was passed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streams
possibly coming from the Bitter Lakes and Red Bluff points.  I had them pull moisture readings and they
were well below TW's  #7 of water.  They said it was more like drip.  This heavies are in the gas stream
that is falling out and collecting in the pipe.  I agree that we need to run pigs when we have the volumes.
We in gas control will continue to work with the field to make that happen.
If I have the wrong impression on what is happening I apologize.  Please let me know.

Thanks DS

I gave the IP Transit deal a quick look, and it appears to me that what we need to do is prepare an amended confirm, with the capacity and price varying, depending on the month.  May want to revisit the starting dates based on our letter agreement.  Please take a look at the confirm and see if there is anything else you think we need to change.

I suggest that we make a capacity/price schedule and attach it, amending the confirm to refer to the new schedule.

What do you think?

Congrats to you and your wife on your new arrival.     <NAME/> she's a good sleeper.      Now at least you can field some different questions,  "how is the baby?"   versus "where is the baby?"
But,  as <NAME/> used to say,  "enough about you,   let's talk about me."   I spoke with <NAME/> B again and he is agreeable to the idea of my return.    He mentioned that West has needs in Services,  Middle Mkt - SW and even Structuring.    I think that I would be a good fit in Mid Mkt,  as I could build upon my experience  and also learn as much of the structuring side as  possible.     Wherever I go,  I am ready to make an impact.

 The HR department here in <NAME/> wants me to entertain other opportunities within <NAME/> and they have brought some things before me today.    I had also considered staying and building the Ercot business here,  as there is a huge need for leadership in this area.    However,   Real Time roles are very hard to shed around here and I am apprehensive about being a Commercial Director managing Real Time.   I have no doubt that I could make a huge difference here,  but a lot of time would have to be wasted defending the group and myself.   

Anyway,  I wish we could sit down, have a beer and discuss,  but that's probably not practical.     Belden says to talk with you about the needs of the floor and get some idea where the ideal fit might be.      

 I know that you are out of the office,  but give me an e-mail when you get a chance.

<NAME/>,
Good morning, hope you had a good weekend.
I have run the SAR for Friday's West-BOM piece.  The SAR and INC sheet are matching if the 42 mw purchase from the imbalance at $44 is factored in--Remember, we were cut for HE 10 when Palo Verde 2 went down, this is a RT cut and is not in CAPS. Please make sure that the $44 is accounted for under ST-WBOM in the Volume Management flash.  You may want to walk over and "remind" them of this.

I am running the SAR for Saturday through Monday.  Hopefully everything will work.  If you need anything over the next few days, give me a call on my cell.
<NAME/> <NAME/> will be in at 8.  Could you also look into getting him set up with his access to our systems.

Thanks,

Please remember to put the Tag # in the inc sheet. Every schedule should now be tagged if it is outside of the CAISO. Please get the tag # from our counterparties to put in the inc sheet. This should greatly improve our settlements process and minimize disputes. Include a comment in the Tag # section if there is no tag.

The answer about environmentalist making it hard to build power plants in california is YES.   Even with load growth and, asset divestiture they wouldn't face the facts that the supply/demand picture was messed up.  They wanted all of the plants to be built in other states such as Arizona and Nevada.

Environmentalists (fish people) were trying to get rid of the hydro dams in the Pac NW.  It is definitely an issue they, as well as California will experience this year as the dams are only filled to 55% of normal.  This equates to approximately 3000-4000 MWh short.  Typically in the summer, the pac NW exports about 4200 MWH to California.  Guess what - there will be no exports this summer.  The light WILL go out in Cali!!!!

I don't think the triggers are correct.

<NAME/>, this brings up a good question that may already be addressed. Both of the Midland deals still show up in the trading system.  Should they be terminated effective 6/1/2002?  One of the Midland deals (MCV 2, deals #340305 and 332163) was put in Sitara with triggers.  We stopped serving MCV 2 effective 4/1/2002.  These triggers will continue to create an invoice each month unless we change the deal in Sitara.

Tallahassee called on the gas for the weekend.  I had planned for that in my numbers but I had no idea prices would go up $.07 - $.11 for the weekend - my fault.  This makes my cash balance at Reliant short by about $130.00 if prices post on the high side.  My trading contact at Reliant said that his credit department DOES NOT want to work with us at all.  My contact said his credit department could force him to cut the deal.  We won't know until this afternoon or Monday.  So please try to get the wire out today.

TJ:
Please make sure that the Ercot RC is not billed for our portion of the customer trip.   If I can assist with this accounting,  let me know.    I dont wish to subsidize the other Hourly traders who are now able to attend this customer meeting at my expense.

In the future,   I need to be aware of any decisions that will adversely affect me or my group.
I am a Commercial Director and no one below this rank should be making decisions on my behalf without my knowledge.

I do realize what a large undertaking this trip was.   We werent able to secure a commitment from customers,  but I was confident that our spots could be filled internally ( with our group members).    I am sure that the overall headcount for this trip
did not change,  rather the allocation to each group was changed.

My goal is not to give you a hard time - I dont usually mention rank or make much of a big deal out of anything.
But I do expect a certain amount of respect given my rank,  profitability and that I have been here 8 years.
I try to extend the same courtesy to you and your staff.

I don't know what you're smokin up there, but every one of those deal numbers you listed are WRONG.  

Deal 633842 is valid for mtr 416.  It has a zero nom.  You can send that to POPS or path a volume to the deal and send it on.
I added the 15th-18th to deal 621598 for item (2).
Deal 529738 is valid for mtr 1598.  It has a zero nom, also.

<NAME/>,

<NAME/> you're doing well and continuing to enjoy Newport...My friend lives down there in Huntington Beach (watch out for him!), he moved down there about 3 months ago.  I have been planning on visiting him for a while.  I wouldn't mind getting your perspective on the city as well when I come down.  Last time I was in LA, I spent a fair amount of time on the Strip and around Hollywood before heading home.  Another guy I know down there works at the House of Blues and got me tickets to Taj Mahal--<NAME/> Segal came out and played guitar with them at the end (the guy was NOT good)--which was nice.  Also, one of my neighbors from college works on the Maury Povich show (I think).  So, I definitely need to go down there for a visit.  I will be in Sacramento towards the end of July (16th thru 18th) and then am planning to get down to LA right at the start of August for work and perhaps a bit of goofing off.  So whatever, if I make it down there it should be a decent time.

Sorry to hear about the possible cancelation of the trip to Portland, hope you can make it (though the deck seems stacked against you this time around).  I will plan for you to be here (so you wouldn't be stuck in a hotel), but don't worry if you can't get here on the 3rd.  Plenty of time for that, as the sun should be out for a while (til October anyway). 

I was knocking around going snowboarding up at Timberline on Saturday (get a few runs in before 10), but I am leaning towards a trip around Mt. St. Helens on my bike instead.  It's supposed to be around 80 and sunny here on Saturday and you can't pass such weekends up.  St. Helens should be gorgeous and since we are in the middle of a drought in the Northwest I want to check out the level of the resevoirs up in the mountains.  We'll see though, either way I will be getting up early to catch the sunrise in the mountains.

So work was solid today, got just about everything accomplished that I wanted to.  No one brought me lunch after working the night shift...but what can you do?  

Anyway, hope the funeral goes well (you know...as it can), and keep me posted on when/if you might get up to Portland.  Oh.  And as for a picture, I'll see what I can do.  <NAME/>'s got a couple, but I don't have any that I can pop on the web right now and send down to you.  I admit, I have been called an Ogre before (I am a bit of a taller, bigger fellow on the soccer field--and some forwards have unresolved issues concerning it), but...well...<NAME/> should be able to fill you in.  Like I said I will see what I can do about a picture.
Enjoy your time in LA,
And take care.

I think this link will take you to the appropriate map...if it doesn't work just go to Houstoncitysearch.com and look up Black Lab...it will take you to a map.

<NAME/>,

I wanted to check with you quickly regarding taking a month-long position in August.  I would like to buy a piece of NP, sell a piece of SP, and sell PV. I believe that value exists in taking these positions into the real-time market throughout August.  NP and SP are currently trading near flat.  I think the potential for real-time congestion revenue(RT has seen approximately $250,000 so far this month) across constrained paths in California makes this a low risk way to generate value in a low liquidity market. I have discussed a month long short at PV with <NAME/> <NAME/>. While I recognize the rest of the desk has a position, I think RT can generate good value liquidating in the shoulder hours beyond what could be generated by just filling dailies because of the current price levels.  This also represents a relatively low risk trade (under $10 downside).  I also would like to use these positions as a basis in hourly EOL trading as well.  If you have concerns or questions please let me know, otherwise I will put these positions on over the next week.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

We are short 100 mw's in the Ercot Asset book for hours ending 7-22.    We want to remain that way,  unless the balancing energy market goes haywire.
We would need to delete our SC counterparty EL Paso and input a replacement QSE in the portal if this is filled.
Enpower shows 100 mw's coming from Ercot imbalance.

This deal would need to be cut and replaced with the power that was purchased for bal-day,  etc.

Hey <NAME/>,

I'm so glad you emailed.  My parents were just asking me what you were up to this past Sunday...now I'll have something to report to them.  It's good to hear that things are going so well for you and I must say I'm a tad envious you're getting to do so many things you've always wanted to this summer (I'm still trying to figure out exactly what those things are).  

We will most certainly have to get together next week while you're in town.  I may be going to <NAME/> for part of the long weekend, but I doubt I'll go before Saturday so Thursday and Friday are definite possibilities.  Happy to hear about your brother and <NAME/>'s impending marriages and can't wait to find out what school will next be graced with the presence of <NAME/> <NAME/>.

Just to follow-up from yesterday. Two key real-time customers would be MPC (load balancing agreement) and EPE (power "consulting" agreement). Other customers such as LV Cogen and Valley are important, but they do not provide the market information or the opportunities of these two. As soon as we have something tangible regarding a new company (and likely before), I think we need to visit these customers and get them back.

Ideas?

Okay, so I'd really like to make a trip up there this weekend ( I haven't spent a weekend in <NAME/> during April and can't imagine why I wouldn't just make the month a clean sweep).  Anyway, I know you're unbelievably busy right now and spending an entire weekend with me would not help you in the least...So, here's my suggestion:

I could either come up Friday night and we could do a late dinner (say 8:30-9:00 ) and then find someplace to hang out for a while or just rent a movie.  On Saturday we could get up, work out, grab something for brunch/lunch and maybe even go to <NAME/> Springs (depending on the weather) and then I could take off and leave you the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday to work (we could even skip the <NAME/> Springs piece).

The other option is to just shift everything a day forward...I'd come up on Saturday and leave Sunday.

Either give me a call or email me if either of these sound good to you.  I will also completely understand if you just really need to work/study this weekend.

<NAME/>

PS - I'm dying for someone to chat with about Vegas...can't really talk to my roommate since it was work related.

Sorry I didn't forwarn you so you could choose to re-schedule.  Funny how things can change in just one week!  <NAME/> is awesome - don't know what I would do without her.  We just went to Berryhill and had a taco and margarita.  Not a late night.  You didn't have to leave - I am glad you came though.  <NAME/> we can do it again sometime - once I get over this hump.  (See, I am still insecure and a disaster when it comes to relationships! and I hadn't even gone there in 5 years!)

I really need to chat with the pipeline on this one but this is my best guess right now.  This gas was parked at Bear Creek on a Tenn park and loan contract.  It is scheduled to come out on Sonat.  To my knowledge, we don't have any Sonat demand charges.  But our monthly demand charge expense on Tenn is at least $376,000.00, mainly due to the Boston Gas netback deal.  I think Tenn would make us prepay the Tenn demand charges to get this gas out of the park & loan on Sonat.


We have 500,000 that was scheduled to come out in December on Sonat.  I have no idea how Tenn/Sonat will bill us for this contract going forward.

You have to love the availability of beautiful lasses for viewing. Things are interesting. <NAME/> is moving right along and we will find out about who I am working for on Friday (our auction should be completed then). Not too much else is new. My place continues to get better (as I slowly furnish it), but Portland continues to be the little sister to Seattle. A couple new bars in town suggest she might be getting closer to puberty but definitely not the woman about town that Seattle is. Morgan told me you may no longer be with Steph? Is this true? (And I hope you are the only one reading this if it is not). If that is the case, well, we can see what we can do about it. As always, I have no plans the next couple weekends, so give me a shout (still have my cell phone at 503-887-3449) if you want to take a trip on down. Your always welcome to crash on my couch...(sorry its all I have, I got rid of the futon). <NAME/> youre doing well.

Hey <NAME/>,

How are you?  Long time - no email!  I hope things are going well for you.  Went to Happy Hour with <NAME/> 1, <NAME/>, Stacy, and <NAME/> last night.  <NAME/> and Stacy just got back from the Bahamas.  <NAME/> 1 and <NAME/> left today for Cabo San <NAME/>.  As for me, I am painting the inside of my house.  Not nearly as much fun.  But with this economy combined with my company's 3rd quarter earnings - my net worth is the worst it has been in YEARS!!!!  In other words - I am poor!  

Anyway, we were talking about our upcoming trip on the Poly in January and we were all wondering (especially me) if you had decided to remain in Austrailia or rejoin Casey on the boat.  I think we all hope we see you in Jan! 

Gotta go back to work and try to get this stock price back up - take care, keep in touch, and let me know what fun things you have been up to!

Love, K2

<NAME/>,
I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:

Frontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, starting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.
The OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is zero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week,  per <NAME/> Patterson.

The second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actual energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the protocols.  So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the spirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.

   
Here is the problem:
the head of Ercot Market Operations,  <NAME/> Adams,  interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot dispatchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid.
We explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC means run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to run by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME calc, as we were previously under OOMC orders.

I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  <NAME/> Patterson regarding this issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Ercot's  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate calc,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we would receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   <NAME/> also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someone else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    <NAME/> told me "dont worry,  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money."



Here is my view:
OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.
Ercot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  a group supposedly unconcerned with price.
If OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OOME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance.
OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagreement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.
Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in hopes of filing for a "breakeven."   Ridiculous.

I spoke with <NAME/> Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had "no comment" on whether OOMC means to generate.  <NAME/> Patterson now also has "no comment."
<NAME/> and <NAME/> said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive closure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will receive.

I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in response to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  Ercot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their view was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compliance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.
Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME deployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a software issue, not a protocol issue.   
We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be settled.  Once we have been OOMC'd,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down the unit.    Ercot said that " it was entirely reasonable that we would  request to be compensated in the form of an OOME."
The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an instruction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instruction on a regular basis?

Finally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic environment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations personell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for "forcing them to OOME our plant."

Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me,  what is our next step?  I need to move aggressively on this issue.

Thanks,

I had not heard that there was a discussion today. However, since we ran the economics for Huber and discovered that <NAME/>'s books do not appropriately value the Permian capacity, we have been trying to convince BP that the value of the capacity is greater than the basis spread becase of the optionality associated with the variable costs of fuel and commodity.  We used to have a model that the transport group used to use to value that optionality based upon the volatility of the basis spreads and the variable costs.  Steph and <NAME/> are running numbers to determine <NAME/>'s "extrinsic value".  We need to discuss how and what information we share with BP in order to convince them that the capacity is worth more than the value than that the  outright basis markets .

Guys,

We are missing the congestion revenue from HE 7 on Saturday morning (10 mws at $99.00) in the flash we received yesterday.  Remember, the awarded congestion wheel caused the 10 mw variance we discussed on Monday.

Please see me with questions.
Thanks,

The Hourly Ercot book is long 30 mw's  at $13.25 for hour ending 23 and 24 on Friday.    This is currently scheduled into the North Zone load.
When you sell this,   cut the load and replace with the appropriate QSE trade.

The purchase is in Enpower as #825387.  The sale to Ercot Imbal is under #825406.        Cut the enpower sale and replace with appropiate sale counterparty.
Everything should be entered under the Hourly Ercot desk.

Let me know how it goes.

I heard someone pulled a hamstring trying to be butch w/ the military workouts....

As for me, the trip was fantastic.  Mucho shopping and even more eating.  Not to mention the weather was beautiful and you could actually walk everywhere you wanted to go.  The plane flight back was definitely not fun, but I did survive.  It reminded me of London quite a bit, although I think the weather is milder.  I was actually checking out apartment sites the other day b/c I was that impressed with the place.  It has a definite <NAME/> vibe.  The people are extremely friendly, seem generally happy and there is lots of scenic beauty and tons of stuff to do.  Oh well,  I'll console myself with the fact that I get to live in H-town...always lifts my spirits.

The instantaneous supply in the form of ancillary services was supposed to be provided to us  by COA.   The contract was not specific concerning the intraday gas supply, or how we would schedule intraday power.  
COA wants us to "split the meter" at the plant,  allowing us to schedule our own 100 mw's ( and assume all liability) and also arrange our own gas agreement.
Otherwise,  they dont want to allow us intraday capability.
The agreement doesnt expire until Nov 3, 2003.

Their would be two gas contracts to consider,  I suppose:  <NAME/> needs to contract for their own supply for this plant and also wants to sell to COA directly.

When do you want to talk?

You are correct, 
The EOL trades were not properly acccounted for. 
We need FSP 2000, not FSP 2002...

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder <NAME/> basin of Wyoming.  Their "angle" is that the existing utility, Powder <NAME/> Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, <NAME/> has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this "retail" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need <NAME/>'s assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (<NAME/> <NAME/> would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in <NAME/> with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

I am micro-managing this deal and I don't want it to catch you by surprise.  If you look at my schedule for March, you will see that it is possible for ENA to have a negative cash balance with Reliant before I make the Thursday prepay based on the daily spike in prices.  I get the estimated prices from <NAME/>.  Do you want me to make a prepayment on Wednesday or are you comfortable with the regular Thursday prepayment?  I need to know by tomorrow morning.  I have to request prepayments the day before the wire goes out.

Okay...I'm an idiot...I forgot to bring your email address with me to London (it's saved in my contacts list at work) and I can't check my work email from outside locations...augh!  Yet again, I fail.  However, I had such a good time visiting I think I'm going to try to make a quick trip back over this fall when the air fares are a little cheaper.  That way, I could see you and <NAME/> and <NAME/>.  I will stick your phone number in my physical address book and be a better visitor next go-round.

Sorry again for the oversight.  Also, the next trip I make will most likely be solo (my roommate in <NAME/> came with me this time) so it will be significantly easier for me to maneuver.

I had our contracts folks look into any contracts we had with LADWP.  It looks like we have something that would cover short term transactions.  However, in order to enter into a 12 month or longer transaction, we will need to put a master purchase/sale agreement in place.  I asked legal to send our standard agreement to you.  I hope that you will take a look at it.  Any questions or issues that you might have with it, you can bring to my attention and I will make sure the appropriate parties are brought into the conversation.

Also,  I have attached the prices that you asked for earlier.  Let me know if you need anything else!!

I am still waiting you your recommendations for improving Hesco's contracts with their customers so that we can continue to pursue business with them.  they are consistantly presenting us with opportunities that we are missing out on.  I am currently pricing up a deal for 1200/day for 1 year.  They want to transact by mid next week.  Is it possible to make these recommendations so that we can get this paperwork in place?

Per our conversation, ECTRT should receive congestion revenue for HE 2, HE 23 and HE 24.
All congestion revenue was across Path 15.  All revenue was at $248.
Volumes were as follows:
	HE 2		8 mws
	HE 23		38 mws
	HE 24		30 mws
	HE 24		20 mws

Total volume was 96 mws at $248, revenue should be $23808.

Bobby,
I came really, really close to coming back to Portland.    I was recently asked to help get the Ercot (TEXAS) region off of the ground by organizing,  training and motivating the Real Time group.   I declined initially, as I had previously turned this job down from Portland.    I came to <NAME/> to trade cash.    Bait and Switch.
  Anyway,  I was looking to return to PDX to work in Mid Mkt or Services, wherever I could have an impact (positive impact, jackie).    
Once I expressed to <NAME/> that my bags were packed, more opportunity presented itself;   I am going to get experience in managing our assets in Texas.   We have an agreement with Teco to manage a 480 mw combined cycle facility in South Texas.   We have some other interesting arrangements as well.

I will be working with <NAME/> <NAME/>-Smith, who is the term trader in Ercot.    Good, solid technical guy.   These guys are in a tight spot and due to the timing of all of this,  I agreed to finish the rest of the year in <NAME/> and get this thing up and running.    Ercot is currently not short nor volatile.    Not much fun yet, we'll see how the pool works.
I am working with Smith and <NAME/> Miller as well.

For all of its sound, fury and ego's the <NAME/> office is actually disorganized and short on morale.    
My transition could have been handled better by a monkey man.      My gut tells me that if I stay with the company,  I will be moving back to Portland early next year if they will have me.

Let me know when you will be in town and I'll set up some golf and margaritas.   No boat anymore,  I'm bumming a ride with my friends.

Later,
<NAME/>

<NAME/>,

I was just thinking about some of the record peak demand levels set at some of the Midwest utilities despite less than record temps and slowing economic activity, and the resiliancy of the crude oil market to decline in the face of a slowing world economy.  My conspiracy theory...could the U.S. government be secretly building up military arms and parts at factories in the Midwest and other regions of the country, and if so, couldn't that help explain these records?  It's kind of a crazy thought, but I'd like to explore it fundamentally (do we know the locations of certain plants that might engage in these types of activities, how much power they could consume if called upon to expand production of military goods, etc.)  I talked to <NAME/> about it and he threw a buildup of the strategic petroleum reserve into the theory to help explain crude oil support in the face of a crashing world economy.  Let me know what you guys think...

A heartwarming story of the advances of women in achieving equality throughout the world.  <NAME/> Walters did a story on gender roles in Kuwait several years before the Gulf War.  She noted then that women customarily walked about 10 feet behind their husbands.  She returned to Kuwait recently and observed that the men now walked several yards behind their wives.  Ms. Walters approached one of the women and said, "This is marvelous.  Can you tell the free world just what enabled women here to achieve this reversal of roles?"

"Land mines," said the Kuwaiti woman.

<NAME/> & <NAME/> - I have sold my house and will be moving to an apt. near Kirby & W. Alabama before the end of the month.  I  am in the process of packing up my house and have several other obligations this weekend so I will not be able to arrange for the newsletter distribution.  I believe I gave <NAME/> a list of the distributors - <NAME/> will not be able to continue and <NAME/> and <NAME/> have indicated they would like some relief also.  On the positive side, <NAME/>(?) in the 300 block of Welch (with the new baby) has said she would like to help.  

I can't remember the new officers so could you all arrange for a transition to a new distributor?

Avista put in the 100 mw sale at $70 for HE 1.  BPA and CAISO accepted the schedule.
I have changed enpower deal #727620 (SCL) to a zero for HE 1, and enpower deal #727622 (Avista) to 250 mws from 150 mws for HE 1.

Good work on getting this schedule taken care of.

Group,

I have discussed our lack of handsets with <NAME/> Steiner.  <NAME/> perceives an appetite for handsets in the real-time group, however, we should be getting new handsets (two for each turret) early next week.  These handsets will be labeled Real-Time, this should prevent others from switching out our handsets.  If one of these handsets stops working (cuts out or mute doesn't work) please let me know. <NAME/> Steiner will be providing these handsets without charging us, but if a heightened handset consumption continues, we will have to pay for them.  <NAME/> suggested that we make sure to hang up the handsets, as they tend to get damaged quickly on the ground (apparently it stresses the connections and leads to them cutting out). I feel this goes without saying but maybe...

Thanks for your help with this.

Hey <NAME/>,

I've done some research on the actuals that you make reference to (Vectren).

<NAME/>'s sale with Heartland Steel is at the interconnect between Midwestern Gas Transmission and Vectren (formerly know as Indiana Gas).  The actual volumes that you are reporting and consider to be your monthly actuals are volumes that I believe are behind Vectren's city gate (which means that you more than likely have an imbalance on Vectren's system).  This bears checking with Vectren, regarding an imbalance behind their gate.  You should be receiving some type of statement or invoice from Vectren.

Per the contract, <NAME/> uses the Midwestern Gas Transmission (pipeline statement) to actualize our monthly invoices to you.

I've attempted to draw a diagram for you to make it as clear as I can.

Let's talk!

According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show below.  We have 3 options on serving this deal: 
1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone SL Pool
2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead
3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65

Most of the time we use option #1.  Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost.  However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below.  For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou.  The total transport cost  is $.02 (including demand - this changes each month).  We don't arb the supply with Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this is a term firm sale to NYPA.

Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid price  and the transport expense?

The sky is falling! The sky is falling! 
Oh, never mind that's just <NAME/> stock price!
It is probably crazy but I'm buying some more here!
Good thing that with Equity that you can not lose more than your investment!

<NAME/> lost his last baseball game last night 6-11.
It was not so much they got beat as they gave it away.
They were ahead by 2 going into the last inning and had 9 runs score on 11 errors.
I think we figured the other team had something like 9 outs that inning.

<NAME/> and I are going to LSU this weekend.
<NAME/> is staying with <NAME/> since he has an end of season baseball party on Sunday.
The party is at 2:00 and we are scheduled to get into Hobby at 1:10 so I hope to make it to the party.

Be Safe and may the FORCE be with you!

I've been wondering if you were alive....sorry I missed your call last Thursday, I was in a meeting.  We seem to be in meetings for several hours everyday lately.  Anyway, did you have the "Welcome Back <NAME/> Party"?  If so I'm guessing you've been recovering for a couple of days.  <NAME/> the paper(s) is/are going well.

Talk to you soon,

<NAME/> and Terry, could you check into having a Business Objects report done for all groupings with
	the following information.


		Previous Cyclce Nomination	Current Nomination	Confirmation	Schedule

	Confirmation piece is not critical if that prolongs getting the report.

	The reason for the report  - Gas Control needs to know what changes have taken place and
	this will prevent the teams from doing a manual report.

	If we already have access to something similar to this, let me know.  I would like to be
	able run this report during cycle.  (I think I am probably asking for the moon), but that
	would be the best time for Gas Control.

	Thanks. <NAME/>

When buying from any desk on the floor, you should have a sale from that desk (say ST-CALI) to either WHourly or WBOM, then do enpower as normal. The interdesk sale will not pull up in scheduling and you will have to route the sale in Enpower to the physical buy by the other desk (another words...ST-CALI buys from imbalance, sells to WHourly/WBOM, then WHourly/WBOM sells to EPMICALPOOL, then WHourly/WBOM sells to EPE.
Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks <NAME/>, we have left a message for <NAME/> and are waiting to hear back from him.  Also, we are definitely willing to fix the physical basis for you and float on the Nymex.  And this will help your credit cause.  So now I am assuming that you guys are focusing on fixed basis for 1000/day with GD on the swing.  Would you guys be interested in looking at a transport structure for the first 18 months of the transaction?  I am looking at the economics of this to see if it will help you.  Call me if you need anything.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

I borrowed 19903 from Egan for today's gas day and I need to pay it back by Friday.  For tomorrow, I am going to over nominate Leach.  After the cuts, if any, I want to back off of Leach and take the gas to Egan to payback back part of my balance.


Here are the deal numbers and volumes.


Deal		Current Vol	After Cuts	Comment
1149149	21,000		10,000		Moves gas from CGLF Leach to TCO Leach.
1143923	31,000		20,000		Mainline to Leach Transport
1143924	49,798		38,469		Onshore to Mainline - volume may be off a little, just need to balance mainline
1161116	7,707		????		Onshore to Egan Hub transport and desk to desk.  Move the onshore balance to Egan Hub.


I may be out this afternoon.  I think we should wait until tomorrow morning to adjust these tickets, UNLESS KELLY, you feel comfortable about CGAS not allocating Leach.  


Thanks for your support.

i took the test and this is what it said.
colors green blue yello purple red black white orange
You are a very sensitive person and you try hard (perhaps a little too hard) to make favourable impressions and to be recognised by your peers. But you have that inherent need to feel appreciated and admired and you are easily hurt if all of your endeavours go by unappreciated or not acknowledged. Stop trying so hard.
You are very talented, imaginative and sensitive but you are holding back as you do not really like going it 'on your own'. In preference you would like to team up with someone, someone with similar attributes as your own, to explore - to seek out and go perhaps 'where no other man has trod before'. It is the unusual that attracts you and which will give you a sense of excitement and adventure.
Everything seems to have gone wrong and the situation at this time is such that you are not quite sure which way to turn. So it would appear that you are 'holding back', re-consolidating your position and relinquishing all fun and games for the time being.
You are holding back. You need to find friends in whom you can trust and once they have proved themselves beyond all possible doubt you will be prepared to give them your all. The existing situation is not of your liking - you have an unsatisfied need for mental stimulation with others whose standards are as high as your own. Trying to control your instincts the way you do restricts your ability to open up to others and the way you feel at this time is suggestive of 'total surrender'. This is not to your liking as you consider such thoughts as weaknesses that need to be overcome. You feel that only by control, controlling your innermost thoughts, are you able to maintain your air of superiority. You want to be admired for yourself alone and not for what you can do or for what you may have done. In essence 'you need to be needed' and at the same time 'you need to need'.
You need to be respected as an exceptional individual. This is the only way that you can hope to achieve the status that you wish to achieve. You set yourself very high standards - and come what may - you abide by them.

Here are the most frequently used agreements for physical gas trades.  I draft and negotiate both the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement as well as ENA's Spot Agreement and GISB.  If you have any questions,  I can explain the process including credits part.  Finally,  the Master Agreement was last revised in September of 1998.  These were minor revisions and I doubt you would ever have occasion to visit the 1998 form.  Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

I talked to Milly yesterday, he was ok with the concept of covering the 1 month salary.  I talked to Trish and the easiest/non-tax affected way to handle it is to submit expense forms.  The problem is if you sell the car at a loss, then the loss compensation is tax deductible, if you import the car, then the transport costs/imports duties can be submitted as an expense and is not exposed to taxes. I talked to Trish about exactly what you have proposed and she wasn't sure from an equity standpoint between what was given to other employees that she could do that. However, don't worry about it I'll do my best so that you are kept whole in one way or another.  The easiest position for me to push is if you actually want to keep your car, then you can expense the duty.

I want to hear all about the UK and how you are fairing there.  If i can manage, it I'd love to make a trip over there and see your pad, etc.  Sorry you never managed to meet up with emily, but she was actually in the US when you emailed and then only back in London for about a week to pack up and head home.  So you need to give me a kind of schedule for where you're going to be and when...(i.e. UK vs. US for holidays and what not).

If you have a Messenger account let me know...i'd love to chat "real-time" with you.

Prior to the meeting with the Texas General Land Office I think it would be beneficial to have some one accumulate the following information:
	1)  What has the load profile for the Markets served by the Texas General Land Office look liked in the past?	  how does the load profile look now and how is the 		load profile expected to change in the future?					
	2)  If there is swing on an hour to hour basis during the day how will this be managed if HPL no longer provides the Storage service?
Before we make recommendations on how to solve their challenges I think we need to fully understand the services they provide to the various Texas institutions.

<NAME/>,
I havent heard anything from Anadarko,  but I am talking to several other players.    There is a possibility that I will be relocating to Tampa Florida or possibly back to Oregon.	Thanks for passing my info along and inquiring as to my situation.      We still need to make time for that beer.   I get out of work very early each day, as our trading opportunities are severely limited.

I would like to pass on a couple of resumes from two of my friends that were released at <NAME/>.      My friend has some solid accounting background and his wife worked in HR as a specialist.    They are a Woodlands couple and would like to avoid that crappy drive to <NAME/>.

I know that Anadarko is probably being swamped with resumes,  but I didnt know if your department had specific needs that may match what <NAME/> has to offer.  This guy is extremely detail oriented and capable.
If you could review and pass these on,  I would really appreciate it:  this is my golfing buddy and he cant play anymore if he isnt working.  Just kidding

Tell me what is happening with you.  ( I still dont miss Koch,  but I miss working 8 - 9 hour days!).  I think that <NAME/> Eiben has been long gone from <NAME/>.   I had been looking for him before the layoffs,  but hadnt been able to find him in the voice directory, etc.

Call or e-mail and I will meet at Buffalo Wild Wings or somewhere else.  We dont have to talk about work.....no,   lets not talk about work!

Thanks,

A reminder,   I am 55 mws long for hours 23 & 24 today.   This has been scheduled into the North Zone.    If you sell make sure that you cut the Enpower deal and make the appropriate entries in the Portal.   Enpwr deal   834600   is the sale to North Zone.


The Ercot Asset desk is long 5 mw's  for the offpeak hours at $9.20.   The  Enpwr deal number is #836534
If you sell hours 1-6,  cut this sale to Ercot Imbal and replace with the appropriate counterparty under Hourly Ercot book.    We will leave


Additionally,   Frontera needs to sell the following:

hour ending 4 - 30 mw's
he 5 - 30 mws
he 6 - 85 mw's
Put these purchases/ sales in the Teco Services book.

I have sold them the power swap where I sell them 100 mw for 7&8 ($25).    I then pay the pool price.    If prices somehow appear that they will be greater than $25 for these hours,  please cover and schedule to the South Zone



The Swap went very well today,  since we had a physical position:

Although the physical may lose $1500,  the financial swap will make $17,000.

Here's how it works:
When you buy balday,   you buy fixed ($30) and sell floating (Ercot Pool)
Today I sold fixed ( $37) and bought floating.     

The floating components cancel and we are left with a $7 margin.


Call if you have questions.

Per my discussion with <NAME/> Glazebrook at Tennessee, she wasn't real specific since I don't have an EES ID on Tennessee but this is what I found out.

<NAME/>

Balancing Agreement K# 31905 (OBAD)  This is a balancing agreement for Bethlehem on the 200 leg in Zone 5, probably meter #20816.  This balancing agreement should have been cashed out every month.  She wouldn't tell me the current balance.  ENA had a term sale to EES (sitara #1003036).  The volume was 1,200 dth per day in Tenn Zone 5 and the name of the point was Bethlehem Sales.  The term of the sale matches the term of the capacity release from Boston Gas.
Firm Gas Storage Service K# 38454 (FS-MA Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company
Gas Transportation Agreement K# 38535 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company
Gas Transportation Agreement K# 38539 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & GAs Company   All 3 capacity releases from NYSEG are non-recallable.  In my opinion, this capacity should be the property of the customers EES was serving behind the NYSEG city gate and the capacity should go with the customers.  But, I believe we need to address the LDC tariff issues along with the pipeline issues.
Gas Transportation Agreement K#27848 (IT)   
Supply Aggregation Servic e Agreement K# 80265 (SA)

Of all the items shown above, I am more concerned with the Balancing Agreement k#31905.  We need to know what has happened to the sales customers EES had at this point.  I believe it was just one customer.  How is this customer currently getting its gas?  If <NAME/> is still the operator of the balancing agreement at this point, does it "appear" that <NAME/> is still using this agreement?

According to this site the cap was around $71 for HE 15 and $72 for HE 18.  We had already traded for these hours when the "new cap" had been set.  This is a retroactive cap during mitigation hours.  When trading in the hour ahead market (1 hour before energy flows) we cannot predict the Cap to Market ratio. For example: Expost is $18 right now, and the market is at $91.87.  Any recommendations?

Stewie:
I agreed to stay through the end of the year (February)  to get this project off of the ground.   What I get in return is the responsibilty of trading around our assets in Texas,  a 500 mw unit,  Frontera,  and a 100 mw heat rate call from the City of <NAME/>.   I have asked that these responsibilities be officially committed to writing.
It is too late in the year for me to move to Portland,  get out and make a contribution for the summer.    These guys are in terrible shape here,  and I am needed.
I report to <NAME/> <NAME/>,  who is a great guy.    I am working with <NAME/> <NAME/>-Smith,  who is the Ercot Term trader.   He has agreed to share some of his knowledge with me and I am spending time with the gen group to learn more about the steel.  I will be working with Miller and Smith (weeeeeelllll?)   
This was the best option for me at this time,  and also for the company. 

I will be leaving the main office in February,  whether it is with <NAME/> or not.   I would prefer to stay with the company,  as my options are worth zero at the moment.
We still want to return to Portland,   but right now I am needed here.   

Thanks for checking.    Let me know when you are coming down,   but dont bring your sweater.    <NAME/> things are going well for you and your group.
I'll give you a call later and tell you what's what.    (hey,  I never used to say  that - you were stereotyping).

Group,

Recently there have been complaints regarding chew in the kitchen sink, chew scattered around the edge of garbage cans, and chew spit cups left on desks. Although we are not the only group that uses tobacco products, we are the most visible. The relaxed atmosphere of our group is a priviledge and I expect each person in the group to be responsible for the appearence of our desk and the perception of our desk by others on our floor. Leaving chew spit cups on other desks or throwing chew in the sink is unacceptable. It is a simple thing.

Thanks,

In compliance with my 2001 Performance Plan, I have attached a "client landscape of potential customers" to be completed by November 1, 2001.

An action plan will follow within the next couple of weeks.

Please let me know if you have any comments.

Shawn seems like a nice person.  You should take her out to eat then I'll take you out to eat.

<NAME/>,
We have asked every single counterparty in the NW to sell us energy.  We bid $300 to PowerX and were told that they were abiding by the cap.
We are working hard to get them the energy that they need and will continue to do so.
