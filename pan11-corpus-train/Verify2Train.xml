<NAME/> and <NAME/>:

The Wholesale legal conference is coming up soon.  I wanted to get a head count and the names of the attendees from each of you.  For planning purposes, I have assumed 5 lawyers from each of your groups.  Let me know.  Also, are there any European or South American topics you would suggest we cover?  So far, we have Whalley and Frevert signed up to give us a business update.

Regards,

<NAME/>

<NAME/>:  Thanks for raising that question because it is very important that we are coordinated.  I have forwarded this question on to Jordan and I think he and I need to work together on this matter.  Perhaps the three of us should get on the telephone to resolve.

I have a few thoughts on the offsite.  I think we could have a theme of restructuring and change.  We would have to make sure it is forward looking and upbeat in that we have learned a lot that will make us better in the future.  The presentations could include the following:

1.   What we learned in CA -- Sager
2.   Preparing for workouts -- Mellencamp
3.   Lessons learned in international -- Lundstrom
4.   Deregulation of energy markets -- Kean/Shapiro
5.   Managing Legal Risks -- Haedicke
6.   Executives -- Frevert and Whalley
7.   Europe presentation
8.   Retail presentation

<NAME/>:  There is a conflict of interest in Thompson having all the info and selling to a group formed by him and other employees.  We need to talk this through.  Maybe, he should take a leave of absence.  Should <NAME/> negotiate the deal for ENA?  Selling to employees is sensitive now.  <NAME/>

Per our conversation yesterday, I propose we send out the following memo:

In order to better coordinate the various west coast power matters, effective immediately, <NAME/> Steffes and <NAME/> Sanders will jointly take the lead role.  <NAME/> and <NAME/> will be responsible for preparing a comphrehensive strategy for all the matters, reviewing the strategy with the California Committee and seeking approval of the California Committee before taking any material action.  Please do all you can to assist <NAME/> and <NAME/> on the west coast power matters.

I would copy only the people working on these matters including Steffes, Sanders, Belden, Mellencamp, Shapiro, Sharp, <NAME/>, Tribolet, Lavorato and Delainey.

<NAME/>:

This is a tough battle.  It may be worse because your clients are either the same ones or geographically very close.  I would try to address it by pointing out the limitations of the simplier forms and as a fallback emphasize the increased risk (legal and otherwise) when using the shorter forms.

<NAME/>

  <body>

<NAME/>:

<NAME/> is scheduled to speak on Friday, October 12 at 8:30 am for 30-45 minutes.  No slides are necessary.  The lawyers will be interested in where <NAME/> sees the growth in the company and where the business is strong.  There will be Q&A and I think he will get some good questions.  Some possible questions:  What does <NAME/> expect from the legal department?  How will the attacks impact on our business?  What will be his focus in his new job?  It should be a very friendly crowd -- since <NAME/> knows most of the lawyers and they know him.

I miss you too!
