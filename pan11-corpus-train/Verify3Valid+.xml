Actually, there was one new development late yesterday. Frazier wasn't entirely comfortable with having <NAME/> Fastow in that role in the first place since he may have had access to transportation/capacity information in his capacity as CFO of <NAME/> Corp. The same concern would, of course apply to <NAME/> Fastow's successor. That was why Frazier had suggested <NAME/> Olsen. I spoke with <NAME/> <NAME/> and told her about this concern. She understands, but continues to feel that we should be able to come up with someone who is more substantively involved in <NAME/>'s underlying businesses but who does not have access to transportation/capacity information. I'll work with Frazier to see if we can identify someone. So, let's hold off for now in contacting <NAME/> McMahon. I'll keep you updated. Thanks.

Sergei,
To avoid duplicates I would prefer to pay for only the 18 Big Stalin Russian Political 
Posters (1013259638).
Thank you very much for your understanding. I am transferring funds to Paypal now in the 
amount of:
$16.50 (item) + $27.50 (shipping) = $44.00 (total)

In 3-4 business days a Paypal transfer will be made to ezyroll@aol.com.

Is this shipping from overseas? If so, perhaps this should be insured. Let me know.
My address is:

JASON WOLFE
2300 W ALABAMA  APT 6
HOUSTON, TX 77098

Thanks,

Yeah, what a game.  That 7 - 3 score that held most of the game was a killer on the nerves.  Both Defenses looked very good.  Both offenses looked like they were playing very good defenses.

I do like our coaching staff.  <NAME/> hasn't always had things go his way.  During his first season (7-5) he tried some different type plays and many didn't go his way including a fake field goal in the Independence Bowl that probably cost us the game.  That being said, he has had a pretty good string lately.

Good luck with the rest of the season.

FERC EXTENDS INVESTIGATION OF NEGOTIATED RATE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN PG&E GAS TRANSMISSION NORTHWEST AND SHIPPERS, LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF MARKET MANIPULATION

09/27/2001
<NAME/> Natural Gas Report
Page 7
(c) Copyright 2001, <NAME/> Associates, Inc.
FERC issued an order in mid-month September that set for hearing certain consolidated proceedings involving several negotiated rate transactions between PG&E Gas Transmission, Northwest Corporation (RP99-518) and various shippers. The Commission believes closer scrutiny is called for because these transactions appear to provide the opportunity to impose rates many multiples in excess of maximum approved tariff rates.
The Commission had issued a suspension order in each proceeding that, among other things, directed GTN to explain (1) how it had the firm capacity available to move gas under the transactions in these proceedings, and (2) why its entering into the subject negotiated service agreements did not violate regulations and policy regarding firm transportation service and negotiated rate agreements. The new expedited hearing procedures are intended to further explore these matters. Pending the outcome, GTN must revise both its tariff and capacity availability postings to provide for clear identification of operational capacity; and must post and contract operational capacity on each day of its availability (i.e., on a day-to-day basis), unless it can demonstrate such capacity will be available for some longer period of time.
Questions Same as Those Addressed to Transwestern Earlier
FERC's concerns in this case are remarkably similar to FTS-1 deals recently arranged by Transwestern Pipeline Co. (RP97-288) that are now the subject of an expedited hearing and investigation. Beginning in January 2001, Transwestern made a series of eight filings implementing FTS-1 negotiated transactions with five shippers. The filings were accepted and suspended, subject to conditions, by orders issued March 2 and 28 and April 27. Staff issued data requests to Transwestern , Sempra and Richardson. In the March 28 order, FERC also directed Transwestern to show cause why its negotiated rate transactions did not violate the regulations. Transwestern answered that the negotiated rate contracts at issue, and any others for that matter, would not have been any less firm or provided a lower quality of service had shippers elected, instead, to pay the recourse rate. Underlying these transactions, Transwestern said, is capacity that becomes available only for a short time.
In July the Commissioners voted to establish the hearing to further explore Transwestern 's negotiated transactions that tied rates to gas spot market price differentials between the California border and producing basins in New Mexico and West Texas. For service to the border, Sempra Energy Trading Corp., Richardson Products Co., BP Energy Co., Astra Power LLC and Reliant Energy Services elected to pay Transwestern negotiated rates as high as $27/MMBtu compared to a maximum FTS-1 (recourse) rate of 38 cents/MMBtu, excluding surcharges and fuel.
In Transwestern 's case, the Commission expressed the belief that closer scrutiny of transactions that provide the opportunity to impose rates many multiples in excess of maximum approved tariff rates is necessary: "Did Transwestern withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse service in order to make the capacity available under negotiated rate charges at substantially higher rates?" (See REPORT NO. 2346, pp9-10.)
<NAME/>
Beginning in March 2001, GTN made a series of separate filings pursuant to its rights to implement various negotiated rate transactions under its FTS-1 Rate Schedule with (1) Sempra, (2) Dynegy Marketing and Trade, (3) Reliant Energy Services Canada Ltd., (4) Western Gas Resources (Western), (5) Enserco Energy, Inc., (6) Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, L.P. , (7) BP Energy Co., and (8) CEG Energy Options, Inc.. The filings were accepted and suspended, subject to further proceedings by orders issued on 3/28/01, 5/1/01, 5/31/01, and 6/29/01. The transactions established transportation rates tied to natural gas spot market price differentials between the Northwest Pipeline interconnection at Stanfield, Oregon and the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co. interconnection at Malin, on the Oregon-California border.
According to the data collected by FERC, the negotiated rate transactions would yield average daily transportation rates many multiples of the maximum FTS-1 rate (approximately $0.155/MMBtu, Stanfield to Malin), exclusive of surcharges and fuel, based on the publicly reported price differentials at the contract receipt and delivery points during the term of the contracts. The Commission initiated additional review procedures to further explore questions regarding conditions under which operational transportation capacity may be available on the GTN system.
GTN has already told the Commission that all negotiated rate shippers knew service was available at the recourse rate, but that these shippers chose to structure the pricing of their contracts in this distinct fashion anyway. Further, GTN insists the subject firm capacity was posted as available on the company's website and EBB, consistent with the Commission's regulations.
Pursuant to the suspension order, FERC received the following information:
- Sempra clarified that 10,000 MMBtu/d of its 20,000 MMBtu/d total capacity arrangement with GTN was subscribed at the FTS-1 rate. But GTN insists Sempra requested firm backhaul service with the intent of reversing the path. Under the negotiated alternative, Sempra was persuaded it would not have to pay reservation charges on the full MDQ for a secondary, lower priority reverse path service. In its response, Sempra asserted it wanted to use the capacity on a secondary basis and thus chose to negotiate a rate structure that would best reflect its price risk profile to account for the fact that the capacity may not be available every day. Further, Sempra stated that the gas transported was sold into the daily markets at Malin, PG&E's citygate, or the Southern California border market.
- Dynegy's rationale for choosing a rate formula rather than the FTS-1 recourse rate was to gain additional value from the capacity. GTN had suggested it could enter into a negotiated agreement based on the daily index-to-index spread because the Stanfield-Malin spread, less fuel, did not cover the cost of the FTS-1 recourse rate. Based on GTN's information, Dynegy believed the price spread was expected to widen and thereby would give it "a pricing opportunity."
- According to Western, it initially sought 20,000 MMBtu/d of capacity at the FTS-1 recourse rate, but GTN's response did not allow for the total volume to be shipped at that rate. Instead, GTN proposed and Western accepted another price option: 10,000 MMBtu/d at the FTS-1 Recourse Rate and 10,000 MMBtu/d at the Negotiated Gas Daily Index Rate.
- Neither Reliant nor Enserco filed a response to the Commission's 5/1/01 order.
- Mirant cited three reasons for choosing the monthly index spread rather than the recourse rate: 1) the index spread was easily hedged, 2) at the time the market spread was more desirable, and 3) reduction of market risk. Mirant believed there were no other practical options to move gas from Stanfield to Malin.
- GTN established four negotiated rate agreements with two different shippers: BP Energy and CEG Energy. The BP Energy agreement was accepted as proposed, but FERC accepted and suspended the CEG Energy agreements subject to refund and further information. Similar to the other parties, CEG Energy stated that it chose a negotiated rate rather than the recourse rate because it believed the index spread was less expensive than the FTS-1 recourse rate.
FERC Has Serious Concerns
According to the September 13 order, GTN's negotiated rate transactions under investigation "present several serious concerns." Even with the additional information in hand, the Commission concludes that the filings raise many issues that need to be investigated further. Accordingly, an expedited hearing should explore issues including, but not limited to: whether the transportation capacity was advertised and awarded in an accurate and fair manner consistent with GTN's tariff; whether the rates negotiated by GTN were the product of an exercise of market power (i.e., did GTN withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse service just to make the capacity available under negotiated higher rates); why the shippers agreed to these rates when lower recourse rates should have been available; and, lastly, whether the practice of improving a shipper's standing in the scheduling process by selling firm transportation to undesirable primary points so an alternative point can be nominated is discriminatory against interruptible transportation shippers (since the alternative point is also available on a somewhat best-efforts basis).
Since the negotiated rate transactions also raise concerns regarding GTN's posting procedures and its use of firm service contracts for operational capacity, the Commission also spelled out the need to require GTN to undertake immediately certain measures to identify more clearly the operational capacity available on the GTN system and the period for which such capacity is awarded.
Finally, the Commission discovered discrepancies between GTN and the other negotiated parties' representations regarding the capacity quantities available at the FTS-1 recourse rate. Specifically, FERC's concerns go to the Sempra and Western rate agreements whereby the parties initially desired 20,000 MMBtu/d at the recourse rate but were provided with a combination of recourse service and a negotiated service. These actions by GTN may reflect the exercise of market power and manipulation of the capacity market, the Commission surmises.

I've been working pretty heavily. This past Sat I went to the Rennaisance Festival, which runs
for about 7 consecutive weekends in the fall every year in the country north of <NAME/>.
It is set up like a huge medieval village with jousting, shops, etc. People dress up like elves,
swordsmen, wizards, fairies. (I even saw a fat guy dressed as a fairy) People are really into

		Good to hear from you. I didn't bring the Starwood documents with me when I moved (can you believe that I forgot them?!!!), so I'm going off of memory. I believe that we are obliged to at least offer lease financing to Starwood if the conditions precedent to financing in the lease documents are satisfied. However, we do have the ability to pass through increased costs of capital that we incur as well as other appropriate costs to Starwood.

The  company seems to have a bad reputation.  I don't know if <NAME/> <NAME/> owns any portion of it or not because it is private.  I think, the UK started some investigations re Glencore over the past couple of years.  I am not sure we want the company as part of ISDA.  I am sure others will have an opinion on that.

Joe:
Thanks for taking the time to talk with me regarding the opportunities at Cinergy.  I enjoyed my discussions with the other guys on the trading floor.  There is clearly money to be made trading in the right regions with the right people.  I would like to continue trading, but also learn Cinergy's assets to better understand how to effectively trade around these types of assets.  It seems that everyone I talked to is enthusiastic about growing the business in the right regions.  Let me know if you guys need me to come up and visit again.  Thanks again and I'll talk to you soon.

<NAME/>,
I am trying to confirm that the following plants receive gas off of these
respective meters on NWPL:

Ferndale, WA plant (reduced capacity) -  meter 472
Wematchee, WA plant (closed) - 446
Longview, WA plant (closed) - 227
Troutdale, OR plant (closed) - 302

Could you confirm that the Troutdale plant is a direct connect and does not
nominate through the Cascade LDC?
This may be best answered by whomever schedules your supply.

Also, it would be extremely helpful if you could tell me when the
above plants closed or reduced capacity.

I appreciate any help you can give me.

This is 80% true.

You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
 
1.    Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited kids.
2.    When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real name.
3.    The party is at <NAME/> E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, cake, and a pinata.
4.    It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.    It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.    For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.    They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.    The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.    You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.    The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and get some tortillas and ice.
11.    The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.    You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!"
13.    Someone else says  "I'm  going to have to get you something next week when I get paid.
14.    The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00."
15.    Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.    There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.    You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new house and he has a pool.
18.    The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.    You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.    Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save them some cake.
21.    Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el <NAME/>.
22.    The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.    The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in <NAME/>.
24.    The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.    It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin <NAME/> is there and her birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and <NAME/>'s party.

Good luck with the grass!  I can't even get my little yard covered.  Yeah, I'm open to going out with new people.  Just not really pursuing it just yet.  Depends on how long before I really feel the need :).  Actually, I'm more interested in just making some new friends right now.  I've decided I need a few gay friends to hang out with.  That will get me out meeting more people for other stuff too.

<NAME/>,

		Thanks for sending me copies of the pleadings in the enforcement action that we've filed against SoCal Gas at FERC. Just a quick question. Should we initiate a state court action against SoCal Gas now so as to minimize any claims that could potentially be cut off by the applicable statute of limitations? I notice that the controversy goes back to 1996. It may take a while for FERC to resolve this. Have we concluded that even if FERC rules in our favor we would have to file a separate action in state court to enforce our rights under the transporation agreement(s) with SoCalGas? Even if we file a state court action now, SoCal Gas would probably argue that the state court action should not proceed until FERC reaches its decision. I don't know how strong an argument this is, but even if SoCal Gas keeps us from moving forward with a state court proceeding, would merely filing suit in state court stay the statute of limitations? I'm sure you've thought through these issues already. I'm just trying to get up to speed. Thanks.
