But I'm super busy in the mornings trading, so I can't write much....I can barely even catch my breath in the mornings!!!  Especially today because I just turned my alarm off for some reason this morning rather than getting up when it went off.  So, I woke up later and made it to work in like 15 minutes....showered, shaved, clothed and all.  But I'm not quite all here.  I had my front door refinished yesterday (which it REALLY needed - and it looks great now!), and I think the fumes all went upstairs to my bedroom and gave me brain damage and made me want to sleep!  I promise I'll write more in a bit after trading slows down....

Mr. Joergensen,

A big "Howdy" from your Texas friend.  

I was so glad to get your voice message the other day (week).  It is always nice to pick up a voicemail and have it turn out to be a colleague from the not so distant past.  I hope you and your family are doing well.

As EBS changed direction, I did as well.  I decided to get back to my roots in the gas and gas asset business.  I looked inside of <NAME/> and also with some outside companies and decided to work with Transwestern pipeline (an <NAME/> company).  I've been here for about a month and all is well.  The people here are very nice and very genuine (just like my old friends from London).  It is weird to actually have a product to sell - if you know what I mean.  I think I'll like it but I'm already missing my travels in your neck of the woods.  Also, I'm home so much now, my wife doesn't know what to do with me.

I'm still saddened by the demised of our Blockbuster/VOD deal.  It was a great concept and it worked.  Oh well.  We'll see it someday, I'm just not sure who is going to win the race on getting it to the public in bulk.

<NAME/> sent an email to me and he seems to be doing fine, loving Rio but still looking for a job.  Speaking of that, I hope your job is going well and as secure as it can be in today's climate.

It is a strange time here in America.  The terrorist attacks, the retaliation in Afghanistan and the constant update on new discoveries of the spread of Anthrax are constantly being talked about and on every news channel.  It is amazing how a handful of people can create such sadness and effect the world in so many ways.  There is no doubt that the spirit of the people will prevail.

Take care <NAME/>.  It was great to hear your voice.

<NAME/>

As I sit here this Wednesday morning and watch ENE trade $15.80 I can not begin to explain the pit in my stomach.  I have been an employee of <NAME/> since June of 1984, I have never written a memo to my CEO to express opinions and or ask direct questions. 
	I can not believe that the individuals that are responsible for this catastrophe are still employed.  And I guess I need to understand why?  FIRED THEM !   It is apparent to me  that the information we have given to the market place is not sufficient enough.  "THEY" don't trust us anymore.  Get a plan of action, attack it, and save this company.

This is 80% true.

You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
 
1.    Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited kids.
2.    When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real name.
3.    The party is at <NAME/> E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, cake, and a pinata.
4.    It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.    It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.    For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.    They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.    The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.    You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.    The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and get some tortillas and ice.
11.    The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.    You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!"
13.    Someone else says  "I'm  going to have to get you something next week when I get paid.
14.    The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00."
15.    Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.    There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.    You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new house and he has a pool.
18.    The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.    You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.    Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save them some cake.
21.    Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el <NAME/>.
22.    The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.    The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in <NAME/>.
24.    The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.    It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin <NAME/> is there and her birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and <NAME/>'s party.

I think <NAME/> is going to $10.  I've been quite concerned for
the last month+.  It looks like a number of the senior execs have
done some questionable acts.  It's been quite the moral buster.  They
need to clean shop and get rid of the CEO and entire board for
letting these types of actions occur.  We will never regain investor
confidence until this occurs.  

The problem with ENE is that we make an incredible amt of money on 
the wholesale side of the energy business (natural gas and power) but
we have thrown money at a myriad of bad businesses that lost lots of
money (Azurix water co., broadband, residential marketing.  They need
to get someone in here that will eliminate these losers and focus on
the core businesses.  In my opinion, some of these execs, former and current,
should go to jail.  It's amazing how a group of guys could ruin a great 
company.  I'm sure there will be a grad school case study and a book
written about this.  I'm sure it will be a best seller.

Anyway, let me get off my soapbox.  I'm glad to hear you got a new job.
That would be great if <NAME/> gets the package and looks for something
more enjoyable.  Congrats to you brother and make sure you tell your

The last two paycheck I've received have been wrong.  They do not include the deferral portion of my contract-- it's $1,606 per pay period.  It should show up under earnings.   Could you please help me get this straightened out?  I can easily show us the error.  Thanks, <NAME/>.

I sincerely apologize if I said anything offensive, and really do appreciate everyone who is trying to help us solve our problems.  At this time we are suffering a severe crisis of investor confidence, and we were only trying to be honest about the things we have done as a company.  I certainly know as well as anyone else that many of these investment decisions were made by people who are long gone.  Hopefully those of us who are here can correct their mistakes.

I really do recognize and appreciate your work.

Berkeley, California bans U.S. Flags from being displayed on city fire
trucks because they didn't want to offend anyone in the  community.

In an "act of tolerance" the head of the public  library at Florida Gulf
Coast University ordered all "Proud to be an  American" signs removed so as
to not offend international students.

I, for one, am quite disturbed by these actions of  so-called American
citizens; and I am tired of this nation worrying  about whether or not we
are offending some individual or their culture.  Since the terrorist
attacks on September 11, we have experienced a surge  in patriotism by the
majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had barely
settled in New York and Washington D.C. when the  "politically correct"
crowd began complaining about the possibility that  our patriotism was
offending others.

I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is
seeking a  better life by coming to America. In fact, our country's
population is  almost entirely comprised of descendants of immigrants;
however, there  are a few things that those who have recently come to our
country, and  apparently some native Americans, need to understand.

First of  all, it is not our responsibility to continually try not to
offend you  in any way. This idea of America being a multi-cultural
community has  served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national
identity. As  Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our own
language,  and our own lifestyle. This culture, called the "American Way"
has been  developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories by
millions  of men and women who have sought freedom. Our forefathers fought,
bled,  and died at places such as Bunker Hill, Antietam, San <NAME/>, Iwo
Jima,  Normandy, Korea, Vietnam.

We speak English, not Spanish, Arabic,  Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any
other language. Therefore, if you  wish to become part of our society --
learn our language!

"In  God We Trust" is our national motto. This is not some off-the-wall,
<NAME/>, Right Wing, political slogan -- it is our national motto. It is
engraved in stone in the House of Representatives in our Capitol and it is
printed on our currency. We adopted this motto because <NAME/>  men and
women, on <NAME/> principles, founded this nation; and this is  clearly
documented throughout our history. If it is appropriate  for our motto to
be inscribed in the halls of our highest level of  Government, then it is
certainly appropriate to display it on the walls  of our schools.

God is in our pledge, our National Anthem,  nearly every patriotic song,
and in our founding documents. We honor His  birth, death, and resurrection
as holidays, and we turn to Him in prayer  in times of crisis. If God
offends you, then I suggest you consider  another part of the world as your
new home, because God is part of our  culture and we are proud to have Him.

We are proud of our heritage and those who have so honorably defended our
freedoms. We celebrate Independence Day, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and
Flag Day. We  have parades, picnics, and barbecues where we proudly wave
our flag.  As an American, I have the right to wave my flag, sing my
national  anthem, quote my national motto, and cite my pledge whenever and
wherever I
choose. If the Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't  like Uncle <NAME/>,
then you should seriously consider a move to another  part of this planet.

The American culture is our way of life,  our heritage, and we are proud of
it. We are happy with our culture and  have no desire to change, and we
really don't care how you did things  where you came from. We are
Americans, like it or not, this is our  country, our land, and our lifestyle.

Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion
about our government, culture, or society, and we will allow you every
opportunity to do so. But once you are done complaining, whining, and
griping about our flag, our pledge, our national motto, or our way of life,
I highly  encourage you take advantage of one other great American freedom,
the  right to leave.

<NAME/> Loudermilk
If you agree, pass this  onto other Americans!!
It is time to take a  stand!!

Actually, there was one new development late yesterday. Frazier wasn't entirely comfortable with having <NAME/> Fastow in that role in the first place since he may have had access to transportation/capacity information in his capacity as CFO of <NAME/> Corp. The same concern would, of course apply to <NAME/> Fastow's successor. That was why Frazier had suggested <NAME/> Olsen. I spoke with <NAME/> <NAME/> and told her about this concern. She understands, but continues to feel that we should be able to come up with someone who is more substantively involved in <NAME/>'s underlying businesses but who does not have access to transportation/capacity information. I'll work with Frazier to see if we can identify someone. So, let's hold off for now in contacting <NAME/> McMahon. I'll keep you updated. Thanks.

<NAME/>,

		Thanks for sending me copies of the pleadings in the enforcement action that we've filed against SoCal Gas at FERC. Just a quick question. Should we initiate a state court action against SoCal Gas now so as to minimize any claims that could potentially be cut off by the applicable statute of limitations? I notice that the controversy goes back to 1996. It may take a while for FERC to resolve this. Have we concluded that even if FERC rules in our favor we would have to file a separate action in state court to enforce our rights under the transporation agreement(s) with SoCalGas? Even if we file a state court action now, SoCal Gas would probably argue that the state court action should not proceed until FERC reaches its decision. I don't know how strong an argument this is, but even if SoCal Gas keeps us from moving forward with a state court proceeding, would merely filing suit in state court stay the statute of limitations? I'm sure you've thought through these issues already. I'm just trying to get up to speed. Thanks.

University of Texas police have smashed a suspected terrorist cell. 
Three terrorists, Bin Losin, Bin Whinin, and Bin Cryin were apprehended 
on the UT campus shortly after the defeat of the Longhorn football team
by the University of Oklahoma Sooners. University police warn a fourth 
terrorist, Bin Winnin, is still at large. However, sources within

		Good to hear from you. I didn't bring the Starwood documents with me when I moved (can you believe that I forgot them?!!!), so I'm going off of memory.

However, we do have the ability to pass through increased costs of capital that we incur as well as other appropriate costs to Starwood.
