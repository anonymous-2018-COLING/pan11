<NAME/>,

The day after Thanksgiving is NXB4.  We (Price-Desk) have some special procedures we have to follow regarding swaption expiration.  Other than that, it should not be that different from a non-bidweeek day.  I apologize, I thought the 23rd was going to be NXB3.

In December, the day after Christmas (Wednesday) is NXB2 and the Friday before that is NXB3.  Monday and Tuesday are exchange holidays.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

You doubt my stamina & my prowess in holding my liquor--et tu Brute??!!!  I'm not feeling too bad - considering the time I got home.  I didn't want to wake you.  I've been doing the meeting circuit again this morning, so that has kept me lively.  The post lunch period when things are quiet is going to be brutal though.

How is your day going?

After we spoke tonite, I found an error on a Bravo Natural Resources deal we put in last week.  This is the deal where we spaced out the premium over Cal`02 & `03.  A premium was inadvertantly added on the sale leg of the deal.  Taking off this premium resulted in a $448,773 loss.  I apologize for the error.  We just found it today, when <NAME/> was catching up from being out on Th & Fri.

Thanks,

I am sorry.  I wasn't trying to push Meliza into our lunch.  That's why I was asking how much 'shop' you wanted to talk.  I feel awful now.  I thought it would be fun.  We can grab a conference after we get back (or tommorow) and talk if you'd like.

Unfortunately, we have been put on a hiring freeze b/c of everything that is going on.  We brought on three new people on Monday, but they were interviewed and hired about 1 month ago.  We've lost three people since the merger announcement, but we cant fill their spots w/ new people.

Your resume looks good.  You're correct, these jobs are demanding on your personal time.  This is especially true when you first start.  This is something you would have to talk over w/ the manager that you interviewed with to see how demanding the book is that they wanted to put you on.  We can talk more later.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

I know you're pretty busy w/ everything going on, so this isn't top priority.  When you get a minute, could we talk about how Spec/Sr.Spec get into the Associate/Analyst program?
