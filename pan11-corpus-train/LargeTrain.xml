Greetings:  <NAME/> all's going well in your new venture (or semi-new venture at this point).  You finishing this semester?

SAN FRANCISCO -- <NAME/> <NAME/> will soon leave his job with San <NAME/>'s public utility commission to head up finances for California 's newly formed power authority, which is authorized to issue $5 billion in revenue bonds. 
The board of the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority on Friday selected <NAME/> as its first chief financial officer. He will start in his new position in early November.

<NAME/> has been at the SFPUC since 1999, overseeing finance, personnel and training, information technology, and customer service. He also helped develop the commission's long-range strategic plan and 10-year capital improvement program, which may eventually entail requests for voters to approve more than $4 billion in bonds. 
<NAME/> worked for a start-up Internet company in Palo Alto from 1996 to 1998 before joining the commission. 
From 1985 to 1996, <NAME/> was an investment banker at Lehman Brothers in San <NAME/>, specializing in financing municipal and state-owned power, water, and wastewater systems, according to a release from the power authority. 
He also managed debt financing, financial planning, investment portfolios, and investor relations while a vice president of corporate finance for the New York Power Authority from 1979 until 1985. He helped develop the authority's first conservation program. 
In his new postion as CFO, <NAME/> will earn $185,000 annually.

I made it back to <NAME/> last night.  Incredible security at the airport in London -- it was a mob scene.  In addition to the usual stuff there was an additional search of all carry-ons by hand at the gate and all passengers were patted down by a guard before entering the gate.  I saw several passengers questioned on the plane about their checked luggage -- I couldn't really hear what it was all about.  We were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer.  The Brits were all very nice of course while I was in London but it sure is good to be home.

Spoke with <NAME/> Glisan re our conversation on retail credit and concluded that we should meet with some banks that specialize in this area. Can you prepare a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a meeting. The concept is that a deal flows into a website?? that is basically a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped. If it met deal criteria and portfolio requirements, it would flow directly to an outside shop that would fund, bill, track etc. <NAME/> could possibly keep a small interest in economics and of course a skim. 

Lets review presentation, then discuss with <NAME/>/<NAME/> and <NAME/> D.  and proceed to banks. <NAME/> is clearing idea with <NAME/>. We are shooting for a Friday (23) meeting.

Thanks, <NAME/>

<NAME/>,

As discussed, I need to have daily power outages summarized by Natural Gas (NG) type plants and everything but NG for each WSCC region for the previous year and one year into the future.  The historical part of this task should be considered a higher priority.  Initially, I only need the results in Excel format so the West desk can work it into their forcasts.  We do not need any web interface at this time (maybe in the future).  Please let me know how long you think this would take and your availability as soon as possible.  If we can't get it done relatively quickly (say by wednesday), we might have to try a different route.  Thanks.

As a follow up to last Thursday's lunch meeting, <NAME/> Mills and <NAME/> <NAME/> Ruffer are working with <NAME/> Hughes to further define Option 2 that we discussed regarding the settlements function.  To recap, with that option, EWS would assume internal management of the settlements function, including managing data requirements to and from the outsource providers,  and EES would retain the service management function, defining service levels and pricing, plus serving as the interface with EES customers.  

We will review with <NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/> the more detailed recommendations from this team by mid week.  Then we should have a final proposal of roles and responsibilities for EWS and EES around the settlements function before the end of this week.  

Please call me in the interim if you have any questions or suggestions.  --<NAME/>   (x35926)

Shyla,

I hope its going well!

I just wanted to respond to your request to have the buy's/sell's outline for you in the summery of one month trades.  Could you please explain why you need this information to complete your pie chart?  It would be my  preference not to include this information as our trading positions could be piece together prior to us having time to close out of those positions.  The risk of outside parties knowing our positions is of grave concern and it would be my preference to avoid this if at all possible.

Please give me a call to discuss.

For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy.  We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market.

<NAME/> Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and <NAME/> Sullivan will provide the daily operations report.   

I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning.

Hi There,

I love you, I hope you have a good day.  Work is shaping up to be a real snooze-fest. There are only 9 of us on the entire trading floor right now. Normally there used to be about 65-70 of us!

Waking up with you is so nice, I am looking forward to many years of doing just that. I think we are going to settle in just fine together. I love you and enjoy being with you so much. You are the man I have waited all these years for. Thank you for being part of my life.

I will see you this evening, a little dinner, a little laundry action, maybe a little dominoes and sheet-she-me?  Woohoo!

I love you,

Thanks for the feedback.  

Your model now assumes a modification to the Distribution tariff to include a new rate element.  That may get around the Settlement (although OCA in PA will think that now D is going up and there is no offset in the G rate so consumers are getting screwed because they won't switch).  

Also, can the PaPUC implement this charge and direct the EDCs to transfer the funds to third-party generators?  Seems like that would require legislative changes.  

I like the idea that there should be fixed charge for ICAP - one way to get that number would be to go back to the EDC stranded cost cases and look at their filed testimony - remember if they are earning more from the market than that $ amount, they are overearning on their stranded costs.

As we anticipated, today's call did not advance the ball from where we left off last week with <NAME/>.
<NAME/> is sticking to its guns, claiming that all customers, DA and bundled alike, should pay for <NAME/>'s undercollection, i.e., they don't owe us money, we owe them money.
The call was short and ended with an agreement that:
	1) we'll both continue plodding along in the PUC process with all the other stakeholders who are arguing over these issues, 
	2) we'll keep lines of communication open--to the extend that anyone has any new ideas they want to share, contacts will 	be made, and 
	3) if nothing has happened at the PUC by the time <NAME/> starts readying itself to pay people in Q1'02, then we'll get together 	to try to get agreement on a number as the PUC process continues to work itself out.

If anyone has any questions, just let us know.

Best,

I believe what <NAME/> (<NAME/>?) was referring to is the termination of TW's shared cost surcharge effective October 31, 2001.  I don't think there would be any system changes required.  Typically, TW's rates are entered with a start and end date and (if this is correct) the surcharge should have an end date of 10/31/2001 and there wouldn't be anything else to do.  If it's not entered that way, an end date could be entered now (whether at the surcharge level or at the contract level - the surcharge applies to just 14 firm contracts) and that should take care of it.

<NAME/>,  Is this correct?  I know you're on a project, please let me know if you can check this or who can.

Thank you!

FYI, I just talked with <NAME/> and she will take a look at a 100,000 and 200,000 from Permian to TW/NNG Gray for a longer term.  She will need to look at how much capacity she will have to move to make room for us.  She (and probably <NAME/>) will get back to us.  I'll keep you posted on our conversations.

Thanx for the info. I have 17" wheels on it now so I guess I will have to get wheels and tires. Do you know what the 16" wheels look like? Is there somewhere on the net I can see an example.

3/14	I found the 142 mw discrepancy.  Fixed it too.  But I'm still off with you.  Your sales and purchases don't match by 2 mw>???  I agree wtih 4326 total mwh's
	Purchases: $895776.78
	Sales:  $ 890921.78

3/22	The 35 mw is actually 36 and you are right its the loss rtn, but we return those to you @ zero cost and should not be included in our totals.
	Purchases:  2537 MW 	$ 915,712.31 - we check here
	Sales:	2537 MW  $911,055.41	

Is this all we have wrong with March?  If so, YEE HAW!

California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks
<NAME/> Behr
  
07/06/2001 
The Washington Post 
<NAME/>
Page E01 
Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved 
California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. 
Gov. Gray <NAME/> (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for <NAME/>. 
"We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion," <NAME/> told the San <NAME/> Mercury News in a report yesterday. "You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion." 
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge <NAME/> L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. 
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. 
"What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood," Wagner told reporters. "In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment." The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. 
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put <NAME/> at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. 
Last Friday, Wagner rebuked <NAME/>'s chief representative, <NAME/> Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. 
Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. 
Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a "joke" that the parties might as well wear "clown suits," according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. 
But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., <NAME/> Energy Services, <NAME/> Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. 
Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. 
<NAME/>'s tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. 
California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile "spot market" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. 
In response, <NAME/>'s aide, S. <NAME/> <NAME/>, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. 
That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. 
A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on <NAME/> and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. <NAME/> will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a "refund" because the deals were reached "under commercial duress," according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. 
Industry supporters say <NAME/>'s refund figure is impossible to justify. "There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be," said <NAME/> Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a "just and reasonable" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. 
"It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate," said <NAME/> Wolak, a <NAME/> University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. 
Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room "billions of dollars apart," as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said.

Tuesday - 10:00 to 12:00 - is the all-employee meeting at the Hyatt.  Given negative publicity over the last several days and the dramatic market reaction (stock price today down to $20), the meeting tomorrow should be well attended and I would expect that the questions will be quite candid.  MD's had a meeting this morning with Lay, Whalley and Frevert, and we made suggestions on what should be covered in the all-employee meeting.  

I have dropped out of my recruiting trip to Oklahoma tomorrow so that I can be present at the Hyatt meeting.  Since <NAME/> and <NAME/> are both travelling, I think that it is important to both <NAME/> Lay and employees for us to have a visible prescence at the meeting.  As a follow up, I am pulling together a group of senior leaders within ENW at noon for an informal lunch (in the conference room without door handles!). We will discuss what we heard at the all-employee meeting and how to anticipate employee questions and deal with the possibililty of low morale.  I will stress the importance of visible, consistant leadership at this time, and will ask all to do their part on this.  I discussed this with <NAME/> Piper this morning, and he suppports this effort.

Who do you want to have attend the lunch folllow-up meeting?  I need to send a note ASAP today to get this on everyone's calendar.  <NAME/> Perlman suggested that we included Senior Directors and above.  Are you two okay with this?  --<NAME/>

Yan,

The merged reports look great.  I believe the only orientation changes are to "unmerge" the following six reports:  

31 Keystone Receipts
15 Questar Pipeline
40 Rockies Production
22 West_2
23 West_3
25 CIG_WIC

The orientation of the individual reports should be correct.  Thanks.

I want to make sure that we are adopting a policy whereby any material changes to employment agreements for individual employees are adopted across the board so we are creating consistency for all employees with respect to contract terms and conditions.
 
I think this is very important from an execution and timing standpoint.   I want to be able to represent to employees that "lawyering" the docs to death is not necessary, because we are going to maintain consistency for all employees.
 
I would like an affirmative yes on this question by Tuesday am.
 
Does everyone agree?

FYI.

ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER EDITORIAL: DAVIS HURTING STATE
     In an editorial, the Orange County Register blasts Gov. Gray 
<NAME/> and his board picks for the California PUC, which, the 
paper asserts, have nullified the only good to come out of 
California's energy deregulation - consumer choice. With 
commentary from <NAME/> Izumi, an electricity policy analyst at the 
Pacific Research Institute, the Register says a PUC policy that 
requires customers to buy power from their local utility company 
is forcing ratepayers to fund <NAME/>'s overpriced energy 
purchases.
     The negative impact on California businesses, some already 
in a slump, could force the state's economy into a recession and 
discourage businesses from relocating there, the editorial said. 
It's reminiscent of the 1990's when government policy caused an 
economic bust and state unemployment shot to 10% (Orange County 
Register via Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, Sept. 25, 
http://www.ocregister.com ).

I guess i have to start with saturday night when we met up with dax and michelle at the horsetrack.  I have to admit that i wasn't looking forward to it since i didn't know how she was going to act and if she was going to be bitchy.  About 15 minutes after we got there we passed on the way to the betting counter and she pulled me aside and was so very cool.  She kept asking are you o.k. and almost seemed to sympathize with me.  She said she didn't say anything to dax and would never say anything to him.  She was so cool about it i was totally shocked.  So on sunday dax calls and says they are going to bw3 so after a couple of hours we go up there to meet them.  I walk in and missy and don were there so i was a little surprised.    After we had been there for a while Z, laura, devon, and michelle go to play darts leaving me and missy at the table.  So starts saying so you aren't going to email me anymore and acting all sad.  Then she said i didn't have any balls.  Later don is talking about the heisman and what the statue looks like and she looks at me and says i am not giving you the heisman i guess you could say i am giving you the anti-heisman and motions as if to open her legs.  It was funny as shit.  She also said she dumped dale but i don't know that i completely buy that.  Anyway, all together it was very interesting weekend.  I don't know that i could ever trust missy to be discrete so while it is very tempting it is also very dangerous.

Thanks for letting me know about this.  I have copied <NAME/> Hall, since he manages daily operations for EA I know that he would want to be aware of critical issues, particularly at this time.  I will also use this as an illustration with the rest of my team during a staff meeting tomorrow morning so that my direct reports who manage operations across all commodities will be aware of the potential risks created with manual wires.  --<NAME/>

These are not good fills.   When I gave the order DIS was trading at 21.87 (21.86 at 21.88).   I can understand 2-3 cents but not 9 cents.

Joe <NAME/> said he sent an interoffice envelope sometime last week (he doesn't remember who he sent it to) containing copies of a confirm on the J <NAME/> website, together with a copy of a Service Agreement.  He needs to make a copy of the documents.  Has anyone seen these documents?  If so, please let either Joe (x33316) or me know.

With regard to Socal's comments, do you have any additional information?  This is quite a 180 from the presentations that Socal has been giving to the CPUC and at other forums.  Until now they have been consistently stating that they will have plenty of gas.

It is my understanding that five AEP employees will in <NAME/>'s offices starting May 15th or 16th to get a better understanding of how to do the HPL trading and to direct the HPL bidweek activities for June (assuming close occurs for June).  To protect <NAME/>'s proprietary trading information for May and June I would like the AEP employees not to be allowed in the offices until after 10:30 AM for the duration of their stay.  From 7:30 - 10:30 AM is when the May business occurs and it is also when the communication occurs with HPL employees.

Another issue is what happens if we believe that close is going to occur June 1 and then late in bidweek it gets delayed until July;  who wears the risk positions?  My suggestion is that if AEP is going to set up HPL activities for June then they should wear the risk positions.  The way to accomplish this is to do the following:

	1.  The initial core term index physical position plus all thirty day index deals will be swapped out at gas daily index at the nearest relevant gas daily index 	     point (ie. HSC or Waha) after considering any volumes to be targeted for storage injections.

	2.  Volumes targeted for storage injections up to 400,000/d purchased on IFGMR HSC index related pricing will be sold to AEP in the ground at June index 	     + actual storage costs.  Volumes targeted for storage are those volumes that can phyically get to Bammel storage.

<NAME/>

Case 1
Core term index position    100,000/d long  (50,000/d Waha, 50,000/d Texoma)
Thirty day index position    200,000/d long  (volumes at Thompsonville and <NAME/>)
Total Index Position           300,000/d long

Vols. targeted for storage   200,000/d

<NAME/> sells AEP 200,000/d in storage at June IFGMR HSC index plus storage costs.  Any additional volumes would be sold to AEP at July index.  <NAME/> sells 50,000/d gas daily swap at IFGMR Waha and 50,000/d gas daily swap at IFGMR HSC.

Case 2
Core term index position     200,000 short (50,000/d Waha, 150,000/d HSC)
Thirty day index position     400,000 long   (50,000/d Waha, 100,000/d Agua <NAME/>, 100,000/d Thompsonville, 150,000/d <NAME/>)
Total Index Position            200,000 long

Vols. targeted for storage    200,000/d

<NAME/> sells AEP 200,000/d in storage at June IFGMR HSC index plus storage costs.

Let's talk because I think it may make more sense to flip the other way.  I was hoping to continue using <NAME/> in the morning in the cash trading activities.  So maybe he can run the Texas Risk group while trading phyical similar to what <NAME/> is doing on the Logistics side.

Your ears, or maybe mine, must have been burning lately.  I have been thinking about you over the past couple of days and wanted to call you and schedule lunch.  Is your new office in the Greenway Plaza area?  Gosh, we have lots to catch up on from both your side and mine.

Congratulations!  I know you must be excited and I can't wait to hear about your new opportunities with WHES!

What is you schedule the week of March 18?  Are you available for lunch anytime the week of 3/18?

Thanks,

Rude-Dog, <NAME/> is still treating me like a baby treats a diaper!  Just kidding.  Things are going fairly well and have gotten pretty busy within the last couple of weeks.  Still trying to recharge the girlfriend pipeline on the weekends.  Kinda of in a dry spell right now.  Oh well at least my life isn't complicated.  Glad to hear things are going well for you.  Yes the days of surfing Longhorn boards for 3 to 4 hours a day are over.  

I am really getting comfortable with our DTs actually.  <NAME/> <NAME/>, even though undersized has wreaked a lot of havoc. He crushed Curry in the endzone for the safety.  Sounds likes Tubbs is picking up the double teams (ala Casey Hampton) which allows <NAME/> more room to work.  He is very quick and can get to the backfield quickly.  

<NAME/> my words, <NAME/> Johnson is our best linebacker Now!!!  Watching him against NC was a joy.  He toys with the lineman and makes them look silly when he jukes and blows past them.    The guy needs to be starting now.  I know he has only played two games, but I haven't seen a more talented linebacker play at UT since I began watching Longhorn football.

The game against UH is national on ESPN2, I believe.  You should be able to catch it.  Watch #11 on Defense.  Look for me in the stands.  I be the one wearing burnt orange.

Hi <NAME/>--

	As we discussed, I'm chairman of the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power 2002 conference.  The conference will be held in St. <NAME/>, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html.  Primary attendees are electric power plant developers, builders, operators, and equipment suppliers.

One of our proposed speaking topics is "LNG - a new role in North American supply." A concern among power generators has been the lack of domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing gas-fired electric generation needs.  The Committee feels LNG can and will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future.

I'm looking for an LNG expert who would be willing to give a 15-30 minute presentation on the morning of March 20, 2002, 10 - 11:30am.  They would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate in a Q&A session afterward.  

After you visit the website, if could let me know if you are interested in speaking, I will have a formal invitation forwarded to you. Thanks for the help!

standard reply is that we will be working on the last day and no one knows what it will be like.  Make a reservation and we will do our best to get you out.  The problem is I am sure everyone wants to get out for New Year's <NAME/> so you might generate hard feelings.  I have nothing to do because I consider it to be the most dangerous night of the year and I always stay home.  You decide what you want to do and we will work around it.  If you stay here, I have always heard the Hyatt has a great party and room rate all included.  I am sure other hotels have the same.

I just wanted to touch base with you and let you know my schedule. I am in the <NAME/> office this week from Monday to Thursday but I will be in and out quite a bit meeting with movers and clearing up loose ends. If we need to get together before I go we should probably plan to do so Monday or Tuesday as I will be packing and moving much of Wednesday and Thursday.

We flew into Shanghai and explored for 2 days.  Next we went to Qingdao for 3 days and finally spent 5 days in Beijing.  I would have to say that Beijing was the highlight of the trip.  The Great Wall was pretty incredible.  Should have some pics shortly.   

Work is going well! Way to busy for my taste.  That's what I get for being out of the office for two weeks.  I got a voice mail from <NAME/> while I was in <NAME/>.  He was at the airport here in <NAME/> looking for a ride.  Typical <NAME/>.  Any plans on coming to <NAME/> anytime?

I went to the title company yesterday and as instructed by <NAME/> I signed the deed of trust, the promissory note for 8.4, and the subordination agreement.  Can the loan amount be adjusted based on new costs estimates.  What will happen at closing?  Is the major problem with the appraisal that since the land was only appraised at 1,120,000 we would be required to contribute an additional 180,000 in equity?  If so, that is not good.

You mentioned that the we are firm on the construction numbers given to me previously.  Can you send those numbers again so I can be positive I am not looking at old numbers.  Also, I would really appreciate a schedule of true costs and expected loan.

Thank you,

<NAME/>

<NAME/> --

With EES' push into serving smaller customers, the issues in this situation -- potential affiliate abuse and unfair sharing of information -- will become more important.  When EES focused on national outsourcing, this was less an issue because our products crossed many jurisdictions.  

This issue, of course, is especially important in recently opened or opening markets as the affiliates try and secure large market share.  We are also watching for these activities in places like MI, VA, and OH.

Got your note.  It's a little premature to forecast now - we will have a better idea by April 15 - our timeline for completing our look at a revenue model.  Can we delay until then?  We do have a monthly fee of $16,000 that we are receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our revenue line to date.  I am not sure why it is not showing up as income.  Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date.  I suspect that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost centers.  By copy of this memo to <NAME/> Heinrich, could you and he figure out where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as revenue?  Since our costs are fully allocated to business units, this should be pure margin.  Hey, you have to start somewhere!  

I have a lunch meeting scheduled with <NAME/> Piper on Friday this week. One of the items that I want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses that we are incurring while researching the feasibility of this business.  I don't have an answer for you today on what if any costs will not be allocated to the business units.  Next week I can give you more info on that.

You are correct.  I've got my units confused - the amount on slide #11 should be 110 MMcfd.  

On the San <NAME/> slide #14, I've left out a phrase from the report.  The report reads " total basin wellhead production peaked in 1999 at 4.3 Bcf/cd and is expected to decline almost 22%,  about 2.4% per year, to 3.4 Bcf/cd by 2010".  In the tabular information of the study, 1999 begins with 4,306 MMcf/d and 2010 ends with 3,351 MMcf/d.

All:

I'm attempting to use lattice on windows 2000 under R 1.4.

Rgui and Rterm crash when I invoke "xyplot" or "trellis.device" commands (including the oft-used "quakes" example)

In particular, I get a message box from the windows OS with the following text:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Rgui.exe has generated errors and will be closed by Windows.  
You will need to restart the program.  

An error log is being generated
--------------------------------------------------------------------

this seems to happen right after the graphics window is spawned. 

I'm using lattice version 0.4-0 and grid version 0.5

am I missing some sort of prep work for lattice graphics?

-Credit issues in general.

I will try and get more details for this but we should get together soon and get it organized. EES may attend but not present. I think we should give them an overview of the business and what needs to be accomplished in each of the above areas. Probably a one hour mtg but maybe two. Lets try to meet next week.

Governor wants to cut costs of power 
Tough sell for <NAME/> as suppliers balk 
By <NAME/> Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO -- With an economic "perfect storm" and an election looming, Gov. Gray <NAME/> wants to renegotiate several of the state's expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. 
But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. 
"If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?" asked <NAME/> Cartwright, president of San <NAME/>-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. 
And many experts and analysts are skeptical about <NAME/>' chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. 
"Good luck!" former Republican Gov. <NAME/> <NAME/> sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor's plan. 
<NAME/>, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. 
The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. 
"This could save billions of dollars," said <NAME/> Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced <NAME/>' power contract renegotiation plan. 
<NAME/> Goode, <NAME/>' legal affairs secretary, said the administration is "not targeting every contract" because the pacts have been "extremely valuable in keeping the market stable." 
The governor's aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don't require them to reopen negotiations with the state. 
The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. 
The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state's power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. 
Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. 
The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for <NAME/> as he heads into a re-election bid next year. 
The liability is compounded due to the pacts' potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at <NAME/> University termed a brewing "perfect storm" of fiscal calamities. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. 
The standoff has pitted <NAME/> and Democratic state Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides against another of the state's most powerful Democrats, Senate leader <NAME/> <NAME/> of San <NAME/>, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. 
<NAME/> has called "for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts." 
The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California's future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. 
Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. 
The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California's annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. 
Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. 
But some analysts are pessimistic, like <NAME/>. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames <NAME/> for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. 
The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. 
"We're not going to say no. We'd certainly sit down at the table with them and say, 'Let's see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that,'" said Calpine's Cartwright. 
If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be "very, very severe," but also "they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them," Cartwright said. 
His comments coincided with reports that Calpine's third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine's performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. 
Heller, one of the state's most vocal consumer advocates, said <NAME/> "is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts." 
"Last spring," Heller said, "power companies had a gun to the governor's head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals."

I have reviewed the La Plata Facilities O&O Agreement.  Lee, could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment?  It appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following:

Special Services.  This would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the Operator (TW) and the Operating Committee (TW & NWPLRepresentatives).  If NWPL agreed, their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest.  If we did obtain their approval, future O&M cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners.  (We've agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 3.5% escalator starting in 2001.) 

Addition or Expansion.  Demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity. We have to give notice to NWPL and they have 60 days to participate.  If they participate, they share in the cost at their ownership interest, but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest.  If they don't indicate a desire to participate in 60 days, we can proceed with the Expansion (without any approval, but also no cost sharing).  Also, any incremental O&M associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion.

I think if we went the Special Services route, we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels.  I think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost.  (They probably don't have $260,000 ($1.5MM * .174) sitting around in a budget somewhere that they'd like to fork over for these facilities.)  <NAME/>, what do you think?  How difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilities?

Recommendation:  To save us the 60 days notice period of an Expansion, I think we should notify them that it's a necessary Special Service and ask for approval (& to pass along their share of the cost), but to be prepared to eat 100% of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities.  In this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future O&M attributable to these facilities.

FYI, their ownership interest is still officially 22.3% since they have not executed the Amendment that has been tendered to them 3 times, first by me and twice by <NAME/> Blair.  If	they execute the Amendment that incorporates the 4/1/98 expansion of the facilities, their ownership interest will be 17.4%.

I have asked <NAME/> to set up a meeting with you and <NAME/> on this subject.  I thought there were exclusions relative to EOL transactions and points that do not directly impact HPL.  The problem for me is that if I want to do terms deals in these locations now I want to be able to keep them as ENA and not transfer them with the HPL sale.  Let's talk as soon as possible so I can have clear understanding of the rules of engagement for ENA now and after the close.

<NAME/>,

I could be in a tough situation at the desk with personnel.  Right now <NAME/> Farmer is evaluating an opportunity with AEP.  If he stays and if we get pressure for another round of cuts; I may be in a situation that I have to do something with <NAME/>.  If <NAME/> leaves then <NAME/> is really the only one remaining with Waha experience, that is why I decided to move him to the desk.  Bottom line to me is that based on discussions with you in the past and my experience, <NAME/> is definitely a keeper for Risk and has gained some physical experience in the last six months that will help me out particularly if <NAME/> leaves.  Needless to say there are a lot of variables to manage here but I thought you should be aware it, particularly if I end up in a situation where I have to make more cuts.

I am sure you are in a similar situation with some of your folks so you can probably relate to what I am going through.  I will catch up with you as this unfolds but if possible don't completely put <NAME/> out of your plans at this point.  I have explained this situation to him and I think he understands given he is new to trading.

Any thoughts?

Per our conversation today --

1.	<NAME/> <NAME/> is working with AReM to (a) work on an alternative vehicle for DA - the Bowen bill, (b) get the "taking" argument for retroactive CPUC action to Norm Plotkin and <NAME/> Katz, (c) call APS Energy Services to motivate Boeing, (d) getting AReM active on the date issue.

By the way, <NAME/> <NAME/> heard that the CPUC has received "hundreds" of letters related to the CPUC decision.

2.	Everyone should be working to get customers focused on messaging to the (a) Governor's office and (b) trade associations.

KEY MESSAGES:	1.	<NAME/>'t have the CPUC Make Wrong Decision Tomorrow
			2.	SB78 can work if DA Suspension Date = Sept 1.01 or Later
			3.	Setting this DA Suspension Date Does NOT Mean that Customers <NAME/> Escape Fair Surcharges

I am putting together a gameplan right now for who to call and the messages.

3.	I called <NAME/> Yamane (at Marathon Communications) re: CEO contacts.  Once I receive the list, we'll make a decision on how to proceed with that group.

4.	Hedy is working to get Hertzberg (and any others) to call the CPUC and seek another delay.

5.	<NAME/> Day - can you please draft language to use on the Assembly floor to "fix" SB78 per our interests.  Hedy & Bev, who should support the amendment?  <NAME/>'t we need a member to carry the provision?  Wouldn't it be better if we had CMTA or the CA Restaurant Association?  Is this possible?

6.	<NAME/> Govenar is calling Boeing's lobbyist to get them "interested".

Thanks everybody.  Keep up the great work!!!

<NAME/> Perlman has fleshed out an idea for maximizing value for creditors of the <NAME/> Estate that I believe has a lot of merit.  As you may know, one of our business goals within <NAME/> Net Works in 2001 was to commercialize mid and back office services.  With the money and talent that has been poured into <NAME/>'s trading operations systems and processes, we believed that there could be market demand for these services.  Ironically enough, we had secured our first services customer and were to begin providing these services on December 1.  Understandably, the customer became concerned during November and the deal was shelved.  Our experience was that there was much interest in mid and back office services (coupling our systems and our people), but that the major drawback in the marketplace was that it was indeed <NAME/> that was offering these services.  The market place didn't want us to "win again" as <NAME/>. 

Obviously, the world has changed.  While effort is currently focused on the formation of Netco and how to realize value from remaining contracts within EGM, EIM, EA, EES, etc., I think that we would short-change the Estate if we did not bring the idea of a services company to at least the proposal stage in order to evaluate its potential value for the Estate.  The idea would be to form this services company with a consulting firm, which could provide some capital, additional resource pool and a ready sales channel.  With the potential of spin-off companies from <NAME/> and with former <NAME/> employees taking jobs with other firms, many doors would be opened for this "independent" services company to provide services.  Servicing the <NAME/> Estate could be the first engagement for this services company.  Depending upon the structure of the deal, benefits to the <NAME/> Estate could be reduced costs for systems and services, perhaps a cash inflow from the purchase of the CommodityLogic tools,  the possibility of some revenue stream from other services engagements, etc.  Another important aspect of this idea is that for the systems and operations professionals, this would create a true career opportunity - a service bureau offering through an established consulting firm - making it much more likely that these people could be retained. 

<NAME/> and I met with a consulting firm today to explore the concept.  There is definite interest, so we discussed the idea with <NAME/> Piper today.  We asked him for clarification around the Netco agreement regarding systems, and I believe that he has copied you on a note to <NAME/> Koehler regarding this.  Our ability to process transactions is one of <NAME/>'s assets, and our hope would  be that we are not limiting the full realization of value around that asset in the way that the Netco agreement has been drafted. 

The next step would be to have the consulting firm conduct a short due diligence process so that a proposal could be presented for the Estate's consideration.  <NAME/> and I would like to move forward with the proposal stage.  It would be helpful to know your view on the process which would have to be followed to consider the proposal.  If we as <NAME/> felt that there is merit to the proposal, would there simply be an approval process with the Creditor's Committee and the Court?  Would there have to be some sort of open bidding process on the proposal?  To set expectations within the consulting firm, it would be good to be able to give them a feel for the process. 

Your thoughts on this idea in general would be welcomed as well.  --<NAME/>

maybe we just hold all the gas until next winter.  we'll worry about that problem next september.  
novy expiry can go anywhere.  Too early to say.   Probably around $2 though as I cant imagine who is a baseload buyer of gas in november when the US is a net injector the first 1-2 weeks barring cold spell and the pipelines are trying to start withdrawing.

did you see black hawk down?  i didn't like it that much, but i read the book awhile ago (really good) and its a hard subject to make a movie about.  my brother is in the special forces, so it's scary to think he could be one of those guys.  

just finished playing squash with ian cooke  i'm guessing you know him too?  

i have so little to do at work these days, its hard to be motivated, but i suppose i could have worse things to complain about.  what movies did you rent? sorry if i'm nosy, but see previous sentence.

<NAME/>

I'm away Monday and Tuesday in Brazil.  I thought I would give you things that I'm waiting on or that we should meet about next week.

1.  Your group was going to give back the assets/balance sheet stuff in 3 formats.

2.  On South America - Lot's of stuff but we'll talk when I get back.  Most importantly that I get an income statement that looks like North America.

		-  They did a trade with me that's up 8 Million for them. This is fine but the negative p/l was not showing up in N.A.  The positive p/l was showing up in South America. (We should make sure this trade does not get cash settled.  The last thing I want is Cash going to S.A. on an internal trade.

		
3.  Cross Commodity Book. - I have 1.9 Million of losses that were last year that they found in January.  Put this in the TBG line and change the line name to Other .  In the Footnotes we will explain all others.  I'm sure there is a million things to come.

4.  We also need to improve the footnotes section you gave to me.

5.  I've set up a meeting with you,me,Deffner and <NAME/> on this 15% capital charge.  We should come up with another methodology.

That's all I can think of now.

I received notice today that <NAME/> Villareal , <NAME/> Lamphier and <NAME/> Gottlob have accepted jobs with AEP as part of the sale of HPL (not to leave until closing).    This means that my staffing needs after closing are as follows:

1 Lead Physical Trader
1 Physical Trader
1 Basis Trader (or at least an asst. trader)

1 Industrial/Utility Middle Marketer/Originator
1 Supply Middle Marketer/Originator

I met with <NAME/> Slone and the internal recruiters today to start the external search process for an experienced physical trader and industrial marketer.
I am hoping the other positions can be filled internally with associates and/or internal commercial personnel.

I delivered employment contracts to <NAME/> Wallis, <NAME/> Schwieger, Stacy Neuweiller, <NAME/> Bass and <NAME/> Farmer.  They all wanted to review the documents and talk to me next week about it.  <NAME/> did not give a good feeling that she would be willing to sign it.  I know that she has been contacted by companies other  than AEP about job opportunities and I know other <NAME/> Units have talked to her as well.

Although we met <NAME/>'s numbers he is still hung up on the super vesting language for options; I'll keep working on him.

The others I did not get any read on, but I will talk to them next week.

Given the severe shortage of talent that my desk is going to experience from the HPL transaction I want you to consider realocating experienced talent from other trading and middle marketing desks to the Texas desk.

I will follow up with you when I return from vacation on Monday, March 19th.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

See story below.

State completes history's largest municipal-bond sale 
California's treasurer executed the largest single sale of municipal bonds in U.S. history Tuesday -- a $5.7 billion offering aimed at covering cash shortages linked to the state's energy crisis. 
The sale -- coming in an environment of record-low interest rates -- also proved to be the cheapest such short-term financing by the state on record. 
And it provided a backdrop for a warning from state Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides that continued delay in the long-awaited $12.5 billion energy-bond sale could wreak havoc with the state's budget in the next fiscal year. 
With the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks delivering a blow to an already shaky economy, there is concern that state revenues may drop even more precipitously than they have in the past year, leading to a crunch for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2002. 
The slower state revenues coupled with increased expenditures and the added burdens of the ongoing energy crisis, could force "Draconian" budget cuts, Angelides said. 
"We were already facing tough budget times in 2002-2003," he said, "and that was before the tragedy of Sept. 11." 
Now, if falling revenues are added to the "$6 billion hole, we'll have deficits akin to the early 1990s," Angelides said, noting the dramatic effects would be on people who depend on state services. 
Earlier this year, the state advanced $6.2 billion in general-fund money to buy wholesale power for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California <NAME/> and San <NAME/> Gas & Electric Co. 
Repayment to the state general fund depends on successful sale of the $12.5 billion in energy bonds -- a transaction Angelides said requires key approvals from the state Public Utilities Commission. 
The huge energy-bond sale initially was proposed for this summer and then moved to late October or early November. 
But the plan before the PUC has drawn heavy opposition from state utilities. 
With utilities and others threatening lawsuits at every step of the way, regulators have needed time to build a legal record for each of the seven decisions the treasurer seeks, PUC President <NAME/> Lynch said Tuesday. 
This year, "we've been taken to court probably five times more than we've been taken to court last year," partly because the commission has been making historic decisions and partly because it's been trying to make them so fast, she said. 
But Angelides said that given the delay in PUC action, he is doubtful an energy-bond sale can occur before 2002. 
Besides raising the budget concerns, that also could mean that California misses an opportunity to capitalize on the very low interest rate environment. 
"I do not see a way now that this bond issue can happen this year," he said, citing the minimum 60 days of public notices and appeal periods that would follow PUC action. 
Tuesday's bond sale to meet the state's cash-flow needs involved what are known as revenue anticipation notes. 
The notes are fixtures on California's cash-flow landscape. In 1993-94, for example, the state sold $8 billion through multiple offerings. No such sale was held last year because the state had an adequate surplus. 
But a year earlier, in fiscal 1999-2000, $1 billion in notes were sold to meet cash-flow needs. 
Besides being the largest municipal-bond sale on record, Tuesday's sale was also the largest muni- and corporate-bond issuance since the terrorist strikes. 
Tuesday's debt issuance was viewed widely as a success because the vast majority of the securities found buyers. 
"It speaks to overall quality of the state's credit and the way the state is perceived, particularly in light of Sept. 11," said <NAME/> Taylor, senior vice president in the Los Angeles office of Lehman Bros. 
As senior manager on the sale, Taylor and Lehman Bros. coordinated participation of more than 20 investment-banking firms. 
"There was wide acceptance from a range of investors, retail (buyers), mom-and-pop buyers all the way to mutual funds and corporations," Taylor said. 
The level of orders exceeded the offering by more than $2 billion. That allowed yields to be lowered through negotiations from the 2.25 level initially proffered to the lowest RAN on record in the state, an annualized 2.22 percent. 
The notes mature June 28, 2002. Overall yield, counting the variable-rate portion of the issuance, is only 2.17 percent. 
Had the $6.2 billion in general-fund money been repaid, Angelides said, the need for Tuesday's short-term debt issuance "would have been substantially less ... if not eliminated." 
Even so, Angelides said the state was fortunate to "move into the market and get extraordinary interest rates, and we will be able to make it through this fiscal year."

On Wednesday we will be having a mini Trading Track interview session.  The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.  We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.

1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the <NAME/> grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.

2.  Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.  That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day. I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.

I know that you will find it to be an exciting place.  Please let me know what your start date will be.  I would love to schedule a lunch with you soon after you arrive.  I hope that you will consider me a ready resource for any questions that you have both before you arrive and once you are in the door at <NAME/>.  --<NAME/>

<NAME/>,

The never ending saga of Enrononline vs. NGX continues.

Under our settle agreement with NGX, we (somehow) agreed to provide NGX with a password and ID that would allow them to see the products on enrononline that coincide with the index's that we are providing data to.  As a temporary solution I created a filer under my master user Id that gives them all physical <NAME/> gas products one month and under.  The problem is they can see the rest of month product bid/offer and the product descriptions of other Enrononline products.  

Would it be possible to set up a password and user ID for enrononline that only shows the products we are contributing to?  Or at a minimum, have them set up so they have their own limited access that is not associated with my login.

Call me when you get a chance (403) 974 - 6733.

Happy 4th of July,

<NAME/>

It looks like they may be wavering a bit.  The only catch is that the redirect must be done 2 days ahead of time..  Also, there must be firm transmission available on the redirected path.  Currently, in the short term at least, there is no firm transmission to any place of value,,,,ie SOCO, AMRN, TVA.  Entergy is still, unfortunately, LONG JAIL...

I don't know what your schedule is this week but I want to discuss ENA's response to counterparties who do not respond to our request for settlement calculations and methodology (e.g., Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P., J.<NAME/>, etc.).  I understand that you may not be the lawyer to handle a response; this is a "protocol" issue.

Also, on the financial trading side, I have another "protocol" issue with respect to nonpayment by non-terminated counterparties (under the ISDA, GTC's or Master Energy Price Swap Agreement).  Specifically, let's discuss ENA's approach and use of a possible "test case" in this area.

Please review.

  

We are working on the gas purchase agreement and should forward shortly.

We received the power of attorney and bylaws you emailed.  I had a Spanish speaking attorney in our office assist me with their review.  The bylaws look fine. We would like you to follow up with a certified copy in the mail.   For now can you confirm via a response to this email, that these are the latest bylaws on file?  

 He noted that under the Power of Attorney, it would be required that two of the gentlemen listed on page 2 of the power of attorney documentation, execute our agreements.  Can you confirm?  Would be happy to discuss this with you.

Hey you back!
 
I'm sorry that I made you feel that way.  <NAME/>'t take it for anything other than I was very busy.  I have no problem being friends and even getting together, whenever.
Right now I'm in a position in my life where I just want to do what I want to do, I know that's very selfish but truthfully that's how I feel.  I think after you get through with all the BS that's going on in your life you will understand where I'm coming from.  So for now don't take anything I do personally, and feel free to call whenever you want.  And, yes I wuld like to get together.....

In an effort to get cash in the door for TW and to maximize revenue opportunity for TW in the coming year, I think we should look at getting two proposals on file with the FERC as soon as possible. 

One would be the OBA filing we have been discussing (and trying to support with historical data) to get automatic cash-out on OBA's in "constrained" areas on TW.

Second would be to look at filing for scheduling by price at alternate FT points.  This may be the time (the market to California is not so hot) to try to implement this.  I know we will have to look hard at the cost of the system modifications required and whether we can justify them.  

<NAME/> is already scheduling a meeting next week for further discussion of the OBA tariff filing.  Could we discuss scheduling alternate FT by price at the same meeting?

I'm still concerned about the terms "price" and "quotation."  My understanding was that "Worldscale" is not a number denominated in a currency but rather a percentage number which can be used with reference to a currency denominated figure to calculate a price.  That is what it looks like in the Baltic Exchange Limited publication.  I haven't seen the IITRA publication so can't comment on how their quotations are denominated.  The problem is that in the first paragraph of the long description, the Floating Price is defined to be the Index.  Therefore the Index must be a currency denominated number.  That is why in the US version I used the average of the prices "calculated using the Worldscale Assessments."  Do I have this all wrong?

Attached is the notice letter to EMP ECHO, LLC for ECS' election to take and make the distributions resulting from the payment of the note for Gallup and Kachina.  As we discussed <NAME/>, Section 5.03 of the LLC Agreement governs the distributions and assuming the requirements of that section are met and upon provision of this notice, the note proceeds can be distributed to ECS.  Upon payment of the note by whoever HPL's assignee is, the original notes will need to be cancelled.  <NAME/>, can locate these originals.

I am not sure if the address and fax for EMP ECHO is correct.  I pulled these from the agreement.  Need to verify.

I am getting ready to announce that I am bringing <NAME/> <NAME/> into EGS as Vice President of Finance and Transaction Support.    Thinking about the current organization, do think it appropriate to consider putting Ms Fischer in his organization?   The kind of things she is doing for you currently are similar to the kind of things we are going to have <NAME/> working with Corp on.   I will be putting into his organization the economic analytic talents and special projects people from the pipeline group as well as some others.    We will not be charging out these costs into the specific commercial units, but instead expect them to generate the ideas and value to pay for themselves.    His group will be providing services to all, but I am willing to carve out some priorities.

That is funny.  I just ordered some more to sell on EBay, I can buy four sleeves for $16.50 and they are going for $40 a sleeve on EBay.  You might want to sell them.

I would also like to put to rest the notion that increasing liquidity leads to negative P&L and that a Trader's support of EOL liquidity will go unrecognized at year end PRC.

I hope it is not <NAME/>, Vandy sucked at offense and defense.  He is horrible and I would hope we would go after somebody else.  We need to get someone in there soon so they can put the offense/defense in and the players can start studying it to get a head start on next year.

<NAME/> --

I received a call today from the CPUC (came through the main <NAME/> number) - a CPUC staffer named <NAME/> at 415-703-2199 (no one was interested in giving the last names).

Someone named <NAME/> at the Quail Ridge Research Station (7001 Hwy 128 Napa, CA 94558) called the CPUC to complain that he was inappropriately switched from PG&E to <NAME/>.  It's a strange situation - the Universities own the bldg and land but a Trust pays the bills.  He says that "the facility isn't anywhere near the campus."

The PG&E account number is ZNL8242005.  His phone number is 503-752-0873.  

I told him that we would look into this and get back by end of business Thursday.

The CPUC staffer is <NAME/> at 415-703-2199 (no one was interested in giving the last names).

My guess is that UC/CSU listed this account on a switch request but didn't ask <NAME/>.  What should we do??

                resets to: 3.10
                reset trigger: 3.15

               resets to 3.35
               reset trigger: 3.35
       

The mechanics of the swap are as follows:  It is a normal swap at the reset swap price unless a particular reference month settles at or above the reset trigger. In that case that month and only that month's reference price resets to the new price as specified in "resets to." all other months remain unaffected until they settle and we go through the same process all over again.

I signed up for the class today.  I live on the far west side of town (just S. of 1-10) so we'll have to leave around 7:15 AM to make it to class in time on Sat. Nov 3.  

Your family is also welcome to stay in our guest apartment.  The good thing about living on the west side of town is that it is only about a 2 1/2 hour drive from <NAME/>.   I'll give you better directions later.

I get a smattering of actual, I tool the family down to corpus to the beach two weekends ago, and half the flight was in and out of the clouds. Having a good auto-pilot and stormscope makes a diference, but stormscopes can be tricky to use unless you have a lot of exprience. The trick is never to put them on a setting of less than their maximum range or they never show you anything until it is too late. I have the stormscope feeding through the Garmin 530. Keep flying.

Do all REPs have to report this information - including our customer complaints?  Even if we only serve non-PTB customers?  Who is tracking this internally assuming we have to file it?  Do the business people understand this obligation?

Hey Tiny,

Thanks for your voice mail regarding Griffith.  I will scout it out on Monday and let you know if I hear any confirmation of the water supply.  Gee, I hope it's not true.  

We are still on for August 8 for our strategy session between Facility Planning and Marketing.  I believe that HR will be sending out the invite.  I thought it would go out this past week, but I'm sure you'll see something early next week.  We will start at 8:00am on the 8th and go until about 7:00 or 8:00pm.  We will be at the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown <NAME/>.

Thanks, <NAME/>.

On the <NAME/> thing.  There's no pressure at all.  If you guys are uncertain, that's no problem.  Just need you to understand that I'm moving ahead.  Most importantly in the near term.  Are you guys hip on sharing the cost of getting appraisals?  Just let me know.  And again, let's keep this light.  No frictions.  Everyone needs to feel comfortable with where they are, etc. etc. etc.  Worse thing in the world is to let biz/finances get in the way of friendships.

Keep your taht moh rising.

Related Party Crashers? SEC Looking Into Possible Conflict on Interest at
<NAME/>

By <NAME/> Taub

The Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that <NAME/> provide
information regarding certain related party transactions. 

"We welcome this request," said <NAME/> L. Lay, <NAME/> chairman and CEO in a
prepared statement. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC." 

<NAME/>, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and
electricity, noted that its internal and external auditors and attorneys
reviewed the related party arrangements, the Board was fully informed of and
approved these arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC
filings. "We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in
connection with these transactions was considered and done," Lay added. 

As we noted on Friday, a limited partnership organized by chief financial
officer <NAME/> Fastow racked up millions of dollars since 1997 in profits
from transactions conducted with the energy company, according to The Wall
Street Journal. The partnership reportedly renegotiated the terms of deals
with <NAME/> in ways that boosted its financial positions or reduced its risk
of losses. 


REPORT: E&Y REVENUES NEARLY HALVED
Later this week, Ernst & Young will announce that its revenue growth was
nearly halved in the fiscal year ending June 30, according to the Financial
Times. 

Specifically, the Big 5 professional services firm will report that revenues
rose by 7.2 percent to $9.9 billion for the year. In fiscal 2000, revenues
climbed by 14.1 percent, and by 13.5 percent the prior year. 

The reason for the drop in revenue growth may be that E&Y fetches most of
its business from the United States, and the U.S. economy tanked in the
first half of this year. 

"We have been successful this year, despite the economy and during a period
of great challenge and change in our profession," chairman <NAME/> Turley told
the FT. 

Rival Andersen has already reported that revenues rose 10 percent this year
through August 31. 

Another reason for E&Y's revenue retrenchment: the strong dollar. The firm
is expected to announce that revenues increased 12.4 percent in local
currency terms, according to the paper. 

Turley told the FT that his clients are less focused on the longer term and
are instead concentrating on watching expenses, cash management, debt
covenant issues, and security concerns. "We're going to see more covenant
violations and that will drive restructuring issues," Turley told the FT.

<NAME/>,
       In response to your questions today:

            1. Research Group--while we do use them for options modeling and sanity checks, we employ two of their quant-jocks directly on NNG payroll (<NAME/> Bolks being the lead).  As long as we keep these two, we could get by without them all together.

            2. Government Affairs--we only use one individual out of the Corporate Staff (<NAME/> Shortridge).  Other than that, they provide no value.
      
            3. Aviation--will be used be my staff only is cost justified versus commercial (coach) flights.

            4. Strategic Sourcing--TAP does provide a cost effective service.  We could do without it, but I doubt we'd save money doing it ourselves.

No development is easy.   I see nothing on your list that cannot be overcome.   Please develop a plan to have a 150 MW on-line my May 02 with rented diesel equipment.   We would install the diesels at OPPD distribution substations.   We may have to do 15 different installations to acheive the desired result.

Last year Com-<NAME/> and IPL completed an installation with CATs in 3 months.   The key is to get OPPD to cooperate with interconnections at the distribution substations and we will get credit for losses.

Please work with <NAME/> and <NAME/>.   If you need any additional info after working through a plan with <NAME/> and <NAME/>, please let me know.

Kelley,

Given our financial situation we did not do any fixed price physical transactions for December so we have no trades to report this month.  Hopefully our situation we be resolved soon so that we can be a part of the process in the near future.  For whatever it is worth, it that there are some unusual things happening in the "Fixed Float" markets in Texas particularily at HSC.  The NYMEX is down 10 cents today yet the HSC fixed float market went from plus 2 cents or $2.336 to $2.345 yesterday to now $2.36 with the <NAME/> Hub also appearing to be inflated by maintaining a fixed float value of $2.31 again in a falling market.  We feel like we are defenseless because we have no trades to report and yet have basis and Gas Daily positions and some trade players know it so they are inflating the prices to hurt us more financially.  I have no evidence since I was not a participant in the fixed price physical market this month all I am asking is that you be extra vigilant in determining the validity of the transactions that are being submitted for index consideration.

Thank you,

<NAME/> <NAME/>

To your point #3Burr --

Probably want to bring in <NAME/> Montovano on the NC PUC question -- we have worked with a local lawyer in the past (I think her name is <NAME/> <NAME/>) that could help with this question and demonstrate that having an RTO does NOT make a state deal with retail competition any sooner than it wants to deal with the question.  <NAME/> Montovano could probably be of assistance here.

I have spoken to Reliant,TXU, AEP, Coral, El Paso, and Aquila about buying the supply we have in storage. They have either told me they don't have any interest in buying it or they just don't respond. Centana is willing to buy the inventory if we will pay for the gas we received in December off of MRT. I have gotten Shemin Proctor's opinion on the situation (see attached). I would like to move forward and settle these issues with <NAME/>/Centana. I have also included estimated cash flows on the transactions. Thoughts?

<NAME/>,

Thanks for contacting me about this.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to  you about it 
today as this matter was outstanding for a long time.

I think we should go ahead and adjust <NAME/> to manager,
effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus
10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager.
Such promotions take place in March and I think
<NAME/> should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
(i.e. my and <NAME/>'s procrastination).

 
On unrelated and more serious matter. <NAME/> Hickerson is the primary client 
for <NAME/>'s services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is 
unwilling to underwrite <NAME/>'s position (he is in general unhappy with
her contribution). This means that <NAME/> will have to find another sponsor or leave <NAME/>.
Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer
will be quite a challenge.
<NAME/> volunteered to pay a very generous severance to <NAME/> from his budget. 
I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.

Our derivatives trading documentation does not generally contain a change of ownership default or termination trigger.  Such provisions are included in all of our master agreements between <NAME/> affiliates and may have been negotiated into a relatively small number of third-party agreements.  A merger by ENA or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of ENA might be a trigger but the analysis is more complex.

<NAME/>:
A few thoughts:
Conference calls on issues of this size don't generally seem very constructive, and I'd suggest that we push for a face-to-face with <NAME/>.
If the Legislature doesn't get the MOU out well in advance of September 14th, <NAME/> won't be focused, and I'd suggest that we try and reschedule.
No matter the forum, the proposal will be tough to get through, even though it makes alot of economic sense.  It's a big change, and big changes don't come easy, no matter the benefits.  That said, no shots, no ducks.  We ought to make a push.
The proposal may not be contingent on Legislation. It might be possible to make it happen at the California PUC.
Assignment to DWR would be significant and might require legislation (need to ask a QF lawyer).
The proposal makes sense for both the IOUs and DWR, since both want as much "headroom" as possible in rates to cover their respective revenue requirements.
Given the pending rate agreement between the CA PUC and DWR, and the utilities' messed-up financial position, DWR is clearly the preferable counter party from credit perspective.
All that said, none of the above matters much unless the utility, a critical mass of QFs and the PUC's consumer advocate ("ORA") buy into the idea.
I'd propose that we continue with <NAME/>. If <NAME/> bites, then go jointly with <NAME/> to persuade the QFs. If the QFs bite, then go jointly with <NAME/> and QF to try to persuade ORA.
On the issue of sleeving through the IOU or DWR, it seems useful to remain flexible on that, though absent general support from the IOUs, QFs and ORA, the entity will be academic.

Some preliminary thoughts.  Happy to discuss further.

Best,
<NAME/>

1). Hickerson does not have any products up yet. I need to find out from Bridges where we are with Cargill. He has been in meetings all morning, I will revert when I know.

2). To be honest I think we are nowhere with Dow, but I have left that to Berberian. I haven't heard a peep from anyone on this. I will find out.

3). I think it is 50/50 on GM. They clearly are interested, but are not very clear on what they are trying to accomplish. They do want to make markets. I think our best bet is an EOL product hosting deal, but their internal process will be excruciating. Next step is they will meet with alan Engberg to discuss listing 7 to 8 petchems on EOL.

4). I have not been moving forward on service level contract because I do not think it really adds any value at the present time.

5). I do think we should seriously consider the case for charging an access fee to EOL. This should not be viewed as a commission.

6). I spoke with Vin <NAME/> of NYMEX and he is interested in pursuing this idea of clearer as credit sleeve for locals. He is tough to pin down and negotiate with but we will run this down by end of next week.

7). Re:kiodex, it is coming slowly as we have a lot of things on the development/testing schedule right now.

8). As you know we are in receipt of the ICE API. We have not been able to do much work on it given 7).

This amused me this morning!

Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a
deserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, a
man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, <NAME/>-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer
wrist-watch, and a <NAME/> Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, "If I can
tell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?"

The shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the large flock of grazing
sheep and replies, "Okay."

The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a
NASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel
tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150-page
report on his high-tech mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,

"You have exactly 1,586 sheep here."

The shepherd answers,

"That's correct, you can have your sheep."

The young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his Porsche. The
shepherd looks at him and asks,

"If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?" The young man
answers, "Yes, why not?"

The shepherd says, "You are an IT consultant."

"How did you know?" asks the young man.

"Very simple," answers the shepherd.

"First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell
me something I already knew, and third, you don't understand anything about my
friggin' business. Now can I have my dog back?"

<NAME/> -

Spoke with <NAME/> Dietrich yesterday.  Slight change to our advocacy versus our Monday discussions.  After meeting with <NAME/> Holmes, it was agreed that our policy work would say (1) no retroactive DA suspension (at least not earlier than Sept 1), (2) don't end DA but study how to allow it to continue.

If the CPUC does suspend without retroactive, the fear is that re-starting the CA market will be very difficult.

Please call me when you get some time.

<NAME/>,

It sounds great. I know from personal experience that it's much better to develop
a new technology quietly and test it before everybody develops high expectations.
If you don't manage the management, they will give you zero credit
for the idea, and a lot of grief for slow deployment.

I see the usefulness of this technology in many places where we trade power.

Is it OK to consult one my associates (<NAME/> Lin) and  ask him for his
opinion? He knows infinitely more about transmission than I do.

A lunch / dinner at a Sardinian restaurant would be great.
I spent a summer in Sardinia in 1970.

I just got it.  I'll fax it.  Trying to read, but am currently reading the latest version of SB 78, which we just got and <NAME/> has faxed.  <NAME/>, here's the latest.  It's going to be heard this afternoon, per <NAME/>'s note.  It is not clear whether 1) it's going to make it through the Legislature, and 2) if it does make it through, whether <NAME/> will sign.  It's very tied up with/linked to the other measures (<NAME/> bailout, etc.).  Am trying to get more info, but that's it at this point.  <NAME/> report back on what happens at the hearing on the bill.

While this statement makes reference to energy, it seems to me it might also apply to metals transactions.  I don't know if we have affected transactions or not.  If so, you may care about this.  My impression is that the <NAME/> commodities traders will be signing off on this, possibly with minor comments, as early as this morning.  If you guys want to make comments (maybe have metals excluded if our traders disagree with the approach), please let <NAME/> Shackleton or <NAME/> Gray know as soon as possible.

Quck question:  w.r.t. to the stipulation with <NAME/>.  1) Do we care that D. <NAME/> will know what our claim (or proposed settlement amount is), i.e., do we prefer that <NAME/> sign a confidentiality agreement?  2)  When we file the stipulation at the Commission, do we care that the universe will see the number, i.e., do we prefer to file any such stipulation under seal at the Commission?

<NAME/>,
     I don't see why the clearing of 41 is a prerequisite.  Let's just get it moved from 4th to where ever so people can see it.  I've got a whole floor of people apprehensive about the move and wasting time talking about what the working enviornment might be like when we finally move back. We've got enough to worry about, this isn't worth the noise.  If people just see it, they will understand that this is not going to be a minimum footprint sardine pack, and any noise will stop. 
     When can we expect it to be available for viewing.  Do you want me to have <NAME/> arrange it with <NAME/>?
     Also, What has happened to our move?  We were supposed to move yesterday, we're all packed up in boxes, and nobody seems to know what happened or when we are moving now.

The San <NAME/> Chronicle
<NAME/>
E.10
(Copyright 2001)

THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, maybe, had he not been saying the other things. 
Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths.
Take <NAME/>, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute. 
And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth. 
We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand that energy companies could create "shortages" whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for "maintenance"? You bet we did. And did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature? We did not. 
But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised. 
Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don't. 
AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn't need. 
I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but never used. 
We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why <NAME/> Cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has. 
Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it! 
Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get away with it! You watch! 
I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any extra money. 
We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We send lovely bread-and-butter notes to <NAME/> -- once we were blind, but now we see. And we await developments, or create them.

Yes.  They want us to record the amounts loaned, normal loans, as a reduction of equity, if ENE does not currently have the ability to repay from either cash or other assets or credit capability.  They do not want to count the 1.5B or the bank loans since they will simply increase the size of the notes.  They are specifically concerned about the current intercompany notes.

Up to you and <NAME/>.  We have already done a meeting in 3AC - today at 11:15.  We had not been provided info that <NAME/> had anyone in 3AC.  We had a meeting this morning during which we reviewed floor meeting plans - I don't think that <NAME/> was able to attend.  
 
Your options are to bring them over to ECN 14 at 1:30, or to have them attend a meeting at 1:00 in 2 <NAME/> Center, 12 th floor in the Forum (a meeting room on that floor).

It was just a funny song making fun of <NAME/>.  You didn't miss out on much.
I signed the offer letter last week, and we went through the orientation and filled out the piles of paperwork.  I won't have the new title and company name officially until the 8th I heard.  

What is up with you?  How's the car treating you?  Were you able to sell the maroon thing?
I'm house shopping now, I want to build one, just don't know where.  It is fun looking though.

I guess that I would look at this a bit differently.  We are not penalizing a person for the cost of obtaining a visa; rather, it is the fact that he did not come through on his accepted offer and start to work for us that is the issue.  Does that matter?

I did not know if you heard that <NAME/> has agreed to settle the dispute over NNG and will fullfill the earlier agreement to deliver the pipeline to Dynegy.  <NAME/> has the right to  buy it back by June 30th.  <NAME/> will still proceed with the 10 billion wrongfull termination of merger suit and include NNG in that suit.  Bottom line for now NNG employees will become Dynegy employees until this other suit is resolved and/or unless <NAME/> excercises its right to buy it back.

<NAME/>, I was talking to <NAME/> Etringer yesterday regarding this subject and he gave me the name of the CFO <NAME/> Craver. I understand that you guys were dealing with <NAME/> Fielder.  
 
For sure we want to know what they are up to.  I think like all deals in California we are going to run into issues with credit, and probably paper but that would pretty much depend on the counterparty. ( is it edison), or DWR? 
 
It is VERY important that trading and marketing are aware of the hedging activities in a very timely fashion so however we need to ensure that happens will be my plan. 
 
Do you know the CFO ?

in regards to the stock, tell me about it.  
flat price me thinks we go nowhere for a while. think the next push down doesnt come again until late october.  im buying z 300/250 put spread for 11.  still looking for 3.1 by end of season.  probably 2.95-3.0 for nov 31.  who wants baseload gas for dec in that scenario?
aga's... think high 70's is neutral the market.  if it comes out 70-85 you can shit on vol.  that'd be good for me.

Virtual Bidding Questions

1)	How is uplift allocated when there is thunderstorm alert in NYC?  Is the uplift allocated to those short going into the real time
 in Zone J/K only or is it allocated statewide?
2)	When is uplift allocated statewide as opposed to superzone?
3)	Are credit amounts going to be adjusted and when?  Right now they are using the delta @ Zone K x 14 days of exposure.

We will be running a December MTD DPR tomorrow.  Before we start this process please recalc the East, West, Eastbank, & Westbank portfolios to AdHoc.  Check one more time that only terminated counterparties are in the Bank portfolios and all terminated counterparties are out of the East and West portfolios.

Before kicking off the calcs, double check the specific deals that are listed on the Physical Power Terminated spreadsheet.  I believe there were whole deals moved to the Bank portfolios by <NAME/> that should never have been moved, because they were already liquidated in November.  Also, I have attached a new copy of the physical terminations.  There is one counterparty (TXU) added to the list that we need to take care of before kicking off the calcs.  In addition to adjusting deal entry for TXU we also need to adjust scheduling.

Before recalcing the Bank portfolios, please contact <NAME/> Brackett or <NAME/> McGinnis (4-2022) to make sure that they have extracted the data they need from the portfolios.

We should still be calcing on 'No True-up'.  Casey, I know you said this probably will still cause us trouble.  At this point, we are going for reasonableness with numbers.  All the previous top-levels in our rolls (as of the 3rd or 4th) will stay as top-levels until we know the exact amount of cash that is being attributed to power.  The remaining prior day values will be held in Schedule E for Georgeanne to move to a balance sheet account.  These top levels should match the total value of your Bankruptcy portfolios.  Where I think it will get tricky is that we are calculating as of the 18th and have transactions in the Bankruptcy portfolio that are before the 18th and therefore will fall into your liquidations.  These numbers will also have to moved to Schedule E.

When running through liquidations in the East and West portfolios, we will not be flat.  Currently, we are liquidating all non-terminated counterparties other than those specifically negotiated out of by scheduling.  (Thresa and I are working on this with Corry and <NAME/>).  The settlements group will figure out what the counterparty agrees with through the check-out and ultimately the clean-up process.

Tomorrow should be a blast - I can't wait!!!

An issue has come up that I did not consider in my prior discussions of how bidweek for June should be managed prior to knowing if we close or not.  Physical deals for June have started to happen already.  If close does occur and all the deals prior to May 18th are done as HPL then ENA will miss out on a lot of potential business for June.  So I believe a fair solution is to have all deals in locations that are most relevant to HPL (ie. Agua <NAME/>, Thompsonville, Oasis <NAME/>, Lonestar <NAME/>, Texoma) be done as HPL; deals in a location such as <NAME/> Tailgate that is relevant to HPL and ENA will be split evenly HPL and ENA and written up as two separate purchases.  Waha is not considered here since AEP already has a Waha trader who is active in the market.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

Here's my take.  <NAME/>'s got an airplane ticket to go down and attend the lobbyist meeting.  From my perspective, there is very little value in that activity.  However, if <NAME/> wanted to go and report back, then a) he gets information which likely doesn't hurt their business and b) the "Estate" doesn't incur the cost of <NAME/> traveling to Sacramento to a meeting that likely won't have a huge amount of value.  But if <NAME/> ain't interested, he ain't interested.  That's my take.

> Calpine Benefiting From California Energy Crisis, Official Says
> By <NAME/> Taub
>
>
> San <NAME/>, California, Aug. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Calpine Corp., a California
> power producer, has benefited from the state's energy crisis by locking in
> ``very favorable margins'' on long-term electricity sales, Senior Vice
> President <NAME/> Macias said.
>
> About 90 percent of the electricity Calpine is generating this year is
being
> sold under long-term agreements to the state, Macias said on a conference
> call with analysts. A year ago, about 30 percent of Calpine's power was
> under contract, he said.
>
> Calpine, one of the largest U.S. power-plant builders, has been buying
> natural-gas fields to supply its power plants, spending about $1.9 billion
> from March last year to July to boost gas reserves to 1.5 trillion cubic
> feet. It also has bought gas in futures markets to help fix margins on
> electricity sales, Macias said.
>
> ``The California crisis, while not desired, has been a tremendous
> opportunity,'' Macias said. ``Calpine may be the only player emerging from
> the crisis with no overhang issues. We are emerging stronger than ever.''
>
> The long-term contracts have an average ``spark spread,'' or the
difference
> between revenue and the cost of fuel to generate the electricity, of
$26.50
> a megawatt-hour, Macias said. One megawatt-hour is enough energy to light
> 750 typical California homes for an hour.
>
> California has $43 billion in long-term energy contracts with Calpine and
> other generators. The state's Department of Water Resources began buying
> power on behalf of its three investor-owned utilities in January after the
> two largest, owned by PG&E Corp. and <NAME/> International, became
insolvent
> buying power for more than they were allowed to charge customers.
>
> San <NAME/>, California-based Calpine expects $16 billion in revenue over the
> next 20 years from contracts with the department, PG&E, the city of San
> <NAME/>, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and other agencies.
> Most of the contracts are for 10 years or less.
>
> PG&E Payment
>
> Calpine is owed $267 million by PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's
> largest utility, which filed for bankruptcy protection in April after
> accruing $9 billion in power-buying losses. Calpine expects to be paid
with
> interest after Pacific Gas submits its reorganization plan later this
year,
> <NAME/> Bodensteiner, Calpine's general counsel, said on the call.
>
> Calpine isn't owed money by <NAME/>'s Southern California <NAME/>, which is
> negotiating a rescue plan with state lawmakers to keep California's No. 2
> utility out of bankruptcy, Macias said.
>
> Shares of Calpine fell 45 cents to $33.25. They have dropped 26 percent
this
> year.

Pls hunt down a contact who handles this and find out if they want to see our piece.  We will probably have 10,000 MMBtu/day. starting out of Nov 2002. 23 years. at expansion rates. 

Call stephanie or myself to discuss.

Jody,

I have not confirmed that these are the correct values, but this should get you started.  These are based on Socal's published long-term storage tariff.  I cannot confirm whether Socal has capacity at these rates available to sell.  Keep in mind I don't think the LNG project would incur the entire cost of the storage, as ENA could extract additional value from optimizing its operation.  It appears the cost is quite sensitive to the winter withdrawal rights, which I do not see any way around unless we can unload more of the cargo directly into the system and bypass the storage facility during the winter.  Please do not hesitate to call with any questions.

I am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in separation.  I had allocated two hours on Friday to do this from 1pm until 3pm.   Are you not intending an all in cost (per transaction) of IT and Operations?

Before the confirmation is sent to the counterparty, the <NAME/> trader will sign off on the confirm.  All broker deals will be handled this way.

Please generate a new daily summary report of all broker deals by trader in the west region.  This will allow me to verify if the new process is being handled properly.

Naveen,

I would like to see what VaR is thrown off by a series of trades. Can you run the following strategies throught he Var model and let me know what the results are.

1).  500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%

2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48%

3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46%

4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap

5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap

6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap

7). Same for Nov02/Mar03

8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02

9). short 500,000 mmbtu of Feb Gas Daily swap and long 500,000 mmbtu Mar Nymex swap

10).short 500,000mmbtu of Feb gas daily straddle, and long 500,000 mmbtu of Mar NYMEX Straddle

If any of the foward prices or vols in the system differ from what I have given you use what is in the system. I would also be interested in what the UBS model spits out for these if available.

Any questions give me a call.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

hey nicki-

i got back yesterday and am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that.  i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  it feels good to be back, too.  

i hope you had a relaxing break and are feeling productive again.

It is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding.  If they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify.

<NAME/> is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release.  If the negotiations stall, it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the utilities.  Hopefully things will go smoothly.

Thanks.  Sorry, we had to cut one hour down to 15 minutes.  Lots of time on budgets - still continuing this week.  What I would really like is a 15 minute download from an appropriate member of the Doorstep Team within a few days of their return from each review.  My goal is to stay informed on an on-going basis, not quarterly or by bunching several of these together.  If there are some concerns, I need to know right away.  Executive management will assume that I am staying informed on a timely basis, and that should be the reality.  The "i's" don't have to be dotted nor the "t's" crossed on the report in order to have this download meeting.  It is also highly likely that someone from the business location that has been doorstepped, will engage in a conversation with me.  I want to be prepared so that I am knowledgeable about the key points from each review, so that I can respond appropriately .  Thanks. --<NAME/>

I figure you are going to turn around and sell them on Ebay(current price is $77).  So, I will sell you the two pinnacle cases for $250, roughly $31 a sleeve.  I now have two cases of the titleist golf balls that will also sell at the same price.  I can send you a picture tonight, when I get home.  I can ship tomorrow or Saturday, I will pay for the shipping.  If you are interested, let me know.  Thanks.

<NAME/> would be good and I do believe that he is an asset.  I will talk with <NAME/> and see what we can suggest. 

With regard to your comment that I am "in", in my conversation with <NAME/> Whalley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some things for the estate and that like <NAME/> Haedicke, and perhaps himself, there could be some issues with the Estate and creditors committee if we were to go to Netco immediately.  What I agreed to with <NAME/> is that I will be focused on the Estate and that I would be interested in talking about Netco in 30 to 60 days.  In the meantime, I will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction.  I will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes, systems, staff expertise and operational controls.

We have the whole curve out.  The nymex is just another trading platform that is inconsequential to markets we make except for arb opportunities and for the fact that our swaps settle against the nymex settlement.  our volume is pretty normal at this point.

me thinks the currency market has seen enough failed interventions that it shrugs off any intervention and may view it as a sign of weakness.  me also thinks that until foreigners quit plowing all their money into the US the dollar should remain fairly strong.  however, if all the hedge funds are short which i assume they would be, the turnaround will be very quick.

<NAME/> --
 
Thanks.  Looks good.  Some thoughts for you to consider:
 
1.    Not sure that Impact #1 makes sense to present.  No real reason to set CTC = 0 c/kwh on Jan 5 (CalPX was still in operation).  I think that Impact #2 better captures the idea.  Also, probably not good to use the term "CTC Eliminated".  Maybe should say "CTC = 0 c/kwh".  Given the CPUC's March 27 Order, the Utilities have a claim for additional generation related stranded costs until March 31, 2002.
 
2.     In calculating Impact #2, what did you use as the Jan 19 - Aug baseline?  Did you calculate the hit of ($104.5) from actual bills or based on our DJ Index model (there is a fundamental difference in likelihood based on the baseline)?  Also, I assume that the Feb - Aug timeframe was relatively low because EES and EEMC had most of their load on bundled service.
 
3.    Probably should discuss in a footnote the different models for PX Credit calculation and most specifically the PG&E Adjustment.  Also, may be interesting to have the $ impact of the PG&E Adjustment (the rate adjustment to re-capture their previous mistake).  I think that this is something we need to go into the CPUC to fight pretty quickly.
 
4.    Should Impact #4 and Impact #5 apply to SCE's loads?  In column 4 it looks like it does.  SCE is not currently hitting our bills with this surcharge.
 
5.    Probably better to model Impact #5 as of Oct 1 not Sept 1.
 
6.    Can you break out the volumes for "vintage" contracts versus "retail gen with passthru" contracts?  You haven't shown anything for (a) Utility Undercollection costs or (b) CDWR bond fees.  These costs may hit our vintage contracts.

Good morning.

<NAME/> has asked me to summarize a request for data relating to employment agreements, as the company needs to decide whether it will reject or accept those agreements in the bankrupt entities.  We also need to decide how to handle agreements in non-bankrupt entities.  We will need summaries of all employment agreements in the entire company, broken down by business unit, group, name of employee, term/duration of agreement, and future obligations under the agreement.

We will need those segregated as follows:

Employees involuntarily terminated in the last 2 weeks.
Employees involved in Newco/Trading operations.
EEL employees
Employees remaining in the <NAME/> estate.

Could you arrange for this work to be done (preferably by tomorrow)?  I would suggest that someone develop a single format that works for this data and then share it with the others.

Thanks!!

The time has finally come for us to mourn the loss of another one of our fallen brethren.  Yes <NAME/> Bass, my brother, will be getting married Feb. 2.  So, with that in mind it is time to set up the festivities for the bachelor party. 

The party will be Saturday, Jan. 19.  I was thinking about taking the gambling/drinking cruise out of Freeport (about 30 mins south of <NAME/>) called The Texas Treasure (www.txtreasure.com).  The cost should run about $50 a person for the cruise - drinks and "gourmet" dinner included or $35/person for drinks and buffet dinner.  Let me know which one you would prefer.  I personally prefer the better dinner.  Gambling expenses are not included in the above calculations.

The cruise sails from 7PM - 1AM.

Let me know if you can make it and, if so, what choice of dinner you would like ASAP so I can make arrangements.

i'm glad you made it to yoga last night.  how did you think the space compares to YIM?  don't worry, you won't hurt my feelings...  they're very different and i'm always surprised when people prefer something like YIM, but yoga tastes vary widely.  i thought last night's class was excellent and i'm glad we all got to go.  i'm not sure why jai goes to yoga - i've been to a few classes with him and it's always the same deep frustration with poses, but ...  

yah, the jump thru to seated is fun, eh?  last night i was playing around with it following her directions and i realized how terrible it is to not be able to jump thru smoothly.  once you do it once you can do it forever.  also fun is to do the reverse - i think the mechanics are easier on the reverse and then you'll be able to do full vinyasa smoothly.

ian's email is indeed ian.cooke@enron.com

ceilis could be fun tomorrow.  let me know when you go.  this week has gone by quickly.  i can understand how you didn't see the scooby stickers on my car because it was dark, but what about the one on my forehead last night?

I'll be home Wednesday night and I fly out Monday afternoon, but I don't really know which days I'll be up at the 1000 islands.  Depending on when I go up to the 1000 islands, I'll probably come back from the 1000 islands on Sunday in time for a little boating and binge drinking.  Would it be a good idea to plan a barbaque or something for Sunday?  Monday doesn't work for me because I'm flying back.  <NAME/> will be around in case you didn't know.  Anyway, I'll be in touch.

<NAME/>

It's time to manage your price risk.
<NAME/>
[Spread 1]
Managing Price Risk
For producers and consumers of ammonia and fertilizers, price volatility is an all-too-familiar cost of doing business. To compete effectively in your industry, you need a way to control the risk created by price volatility. <NAME/> can help with financial price management tools that can smooth earnings, facilitate cash flow management, and bring greater certainty to financing, investment and acquisition decisions. 
 
Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Producers Improve their Business
Few industries are more competitive or volatile than ammonia or fertilizers. From the very unstable pricing found in the markets for raw materials to the ebb and flow of market demand for finished products, producers can face enormous challenges in maintaining profit margins and cash flows.
Now there's help. For many years, <NAME/> has been helping producers like you neutralize the risk of price volatility both upstream and downstream, using financial price management tools we pioneered more than a decade ago for the energy industry. Because <NAME/> is a major trader of many commodities around the world, we're intimately familiar with the risks you face and are uniquely positioned to help you mitigate them. 
<NAME/> can also make it easier for you to trade the commodities you buy and sell, using <NAME/>Online, our Internet-based, global transaction system for commodities that allows you to view real-time prices and transact instantly online. <NAME/>Online posts bid and offer prices for over 1,500 global commodity products as well as complimentary weather, news and market information. In addition, it allows you to view full contractual terms and available volumes for products.
[Spread 2]
Finally, we can leverage, in your market, our position as the largest wholesaler of natural gas and electricity in North America. For example, we can structure cross-commodity transactions that link your electricity or natural gas bills to the price of the goods you produce. In this type of transaction, you would pay more for energy when your product prices are high when you can best afford it, and less when your product prices are low and your cash flows are constrained.

Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Consumers Improve their Business

The ammonia and fertilizer markets that you depend upon are among the most volatile in the world. Yet your investors and lenders are demanding ever-greater stability in the growth of your company's revenues, earnings and cash-flow. For solutions to this apparent paradox, turn to <NAME/>. As a leading provider of price management services across various industries, we can help you buy the commodities you need more efficiently, hedge the risks associated with their pricing, and, ultimately, lower your cost of capital. 
Take a few moments to review the alternatives listed here, then spend a few more moments with <NAME/>. We'll review your risk exposure with you and suggest risk-reducing strategies for taking control of your commodity price exposure.

<NAME/>

Swaps are the most widely used price risk management tool for a variety of reasons, the most common being, no upfront transaction cost. 
Swaps give companies the ability to effectively switch from one price structure to another - from floating price to fixed or vice versa. They are used most often to fix, or lock in, prices and margins between prices. In exchange for price protection, the ability to capitalize on some beneficial price movements is sacrificed.
The typical swap transaction involves the exchange of a fixed price for a variable price tied to an acceptable market index. Settlement is financial - i.e., cash changes hands; physical product does not. Each month during the life of the transaction, the difference between the two prices is calculated and payment is made to the appropriate party.
[Spread 4]

Swap: Producer example 

AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, is interested in managing the margin between natural gas feedstock and ammonia during the next six months. The company is concerned that market conditions could deteriorate more than expected and squeeze margins to the point of jeopardizing the annual profit plan. To eliminate this threat, AmmoniaKing enters into a swap with <NAME/> that locks in the spread between natural gas and ammonia at $100/ton on 300,000 tons of ammonia, or 75 percent of monthly production. This margin virtually ensures that the ammonia unit will meet its financial target.
[chart 1]

DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:

?        AmmoniaKing continues to purchase natural gas from suppliers and sell ammonia to customers of its choice, at floating market prices.
?        On a monthly basis, AmmoniaKing and <NAME/> exchange payments equal to the difference between the fixed spread of $100/ton and the prevailing floating price spread.
?        For example, if the floating spread is $95/ton in a given month, AmmoniaKing will receive $5/ton in a given month on 300,000 tons. However, if the floating spread is $105/ton AmmoniaKing will owe $5/ton to <NAME/>.
?        AmmoniaKing has stabilized a portion of its operating margin with the swap, giving the company the ability to achieve a key performance target.
 
[Spread 5]

Swap: End-user example 

FertPro, a manufacturer of a variety of fertilizer products, is preparing its annual price catalog for many of its ammonia-based products. The company's customer base demands the ability to buy the products at the listed catalog price regardless of ammonia feedstock prices. This makes it impossible for FertPro to pass on feedstock price increases no matter what the magnitude. On the other hand, customers don't necessarily expect lower prices if ammonia feedstock prices should fall; they simply want a listed price they can count on. To service its customers while protecting its margins, FertPro enters into a one-year price swap. The swap effectively fixes the price of ammonia at $100/ton on a monthly volume of 10,000 tons, or 75 percent of anticipated monthly catalog sales.
[chart 2]

DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:

?        FertPro continues to purchase ammonia from suppliers of its choice at floating market prices.
?        On a monthly basis, FertPro and <NAME/> exchange payments equal to the difference between the swap fixed price of $100/ton and the floating price for ammonia.
?        For example, if the floating price for ammonia is $105 in a given month, FertPro will receive $5/ton on 10,000 tons. However, if the floating price is $95/ton FertPro will owe $5/ton to <NAME/>.
?        The net effect of combining the swap cash flows with actual purchases of ammonia feedstock is a fixed price of $100/ton.
?        The swap enables FertPro to publish and stand behind its listed prices with full confidence that the margin on those sales is largely protected from fluctuating feedstock prices.
 
[Spread 6]

CAPS & FLOORS

Like Swaps, Caps and Floors provide price protection, but they have the added advantage of providing benefit from favorable price movements. They are commonly thought of as price "insurance," i.e., for a premium you are entitled to full price protection when prices move through a specified level. A price Cap protects against rising prices without sacrificing the advantage of falling prices. Floors are the opposite of Caps; they guard against falling prices while preserving upside price potential.
With a Cap or Floor, the full cost of the protection is predefined - it is equal to the premium paid for the Cap or Floor. There are no potential future costs related to price movements.
[Spread 7]

Cap: End-User example

CropFood, a manufacturer of urea, wants to develop business with a prospect that has difficulty passing on price increases, but is expected to pass on decreases without delay.
To distinguish itself from competitors, CropFood ensures the prospect that for the next 12 months, CropFood will never ask for a price increase above its very competitive product prices, no matter how high ammonia feedstock prices go. And to sweeten the deal, CropFood agrees to promptly pass on all feedstock price decreases as soon as they are announced, no questions asked.
The prospect likes CropFood's straightforward pricing policy and agrees to purchase 1,000 tons of urea per month. In order to honor its pricing promise without putting the company's margins at risk to rising prices, CropFood purchases a one-year price cap on ammonia at $120/ton for 12,000 tons per month. The cost of the cap is $2/ton.
[chart 3]

DURING THE LIFE OF THE CAP AGREEMENT:

?        CropFood continues to buy ammonia from its regular suppliers at market prices.
?        <NAME/> receives a $2/ton premium from CropFood for the $120/ton price cap.
?        If the market price for ammonia goes above $120/ton in a given month, <NAME/> will pay the difference to CropFood. If prices are less than $120/ton, CropFood enjoys the lower market prices for its feedstock.
?        The effective cost of ammonia paid by CropFood is the floating market price up to a maximum of $120/ton plus the $2/ton premium paid for the cap.
?        CropFood has, for a known cost of $2/ton captured new business by meeting the customer's price needs without putting the company at risk to ammonia prices in the process.
 
[Spread 8]

Floor: Producer example

AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, anticipates a plant turnaround starting in three months time and lasting for two months. The company intends to build extra ammonia inventory of 50,000 tons over the next three months to meet sales obligations during the two-month period the plant is taken off-line. There is concern that prices could soften over the two-month turnaround period, squeezing the margin on the excess inventory to be sold during that time.
To protect against a sharp price reduction during the turnaround period, AmmoniaKing buys a two-month ammonia price floor today that becomes effective in three months time. The floor price is set at $145 and costs $3/ton. The total premium payable by AmmoniaKing is $150,000 (50,000 tons multiplied by $3/ton).
[chart 4]
 

EACH MONTH DURING THE LIFE OF THE PRICE FLOOR:

?        AmmoniaKing sells excess ammonia inventory to its customers at prevailing market (floating) prices.
?        <NAME/> receives a $3/ton premium from AmmoniaKing for the $145/ton price floor.
?        If the floating price for ammonia is greater than the $145/ton floor price, there is no action under the floor contract. The effective price received by AmmoniaKing for its ammonia is the floating market price less the $3/ton premium.
?        If the floating price goes below the $145/ton floor price to $140/ton, for example, AmmoniaKing will receive the $5/ton difference from <NAME/>. In this instance, AmmoniaKing effective price for ammonia is $142/ton - the $145/ton floor price less the $3/ton premium.
?        In summary, the price floor has established a minimum price of $145/ton with full upside potential at a known cost of $3/ton.

Hi there,

Thanks for the note.  It is very weird for sure.  I never thought it would happen to <NAME/>.  One of the reasons I didn't go to a smaller shop, even though I was offered more money, was because I didn't want to deal with crap like this.  Lo and behold.  Life is strange.  Anyway, at this point it looks like Dynegy is the suitor for the big E.  I think it will happen.  The question will become, where are we going to be located?  Fortunately, I only have about 8 months left in my contract, so I won't have to put up with too much crap for too long.  We'll see.

Italy is awesome.  Really really is.  I realize it more and more since I came back.  Tuscany is so cool.  If you go there, go to San Quirico, Montecino and Montepulciano.  Very cool little towns and good wine.  <NAME/> is very cool as well.  I may go back there for a month or so this June if things aren't to wacky.  Have a good time there; I'm envious.

Sounds like you are doing better.  Also sounds like work is fun and challenging.  So do you think you are going to stay there for a while?  Do you miss the West?  I don't think I'll live east of the Rockies, but you never know.

Well, it looks like this year might be as interesting as last.  I keep thinking things will mellow out a little, but things keep getting more and more strange.

It was great to hear from you and take care of yourself!

Maybe we should meet.  I am not sure what <NAME/> has told you but my intent is for at least the near term that his responsiblities not change.  My objective in moving him on the desk is to provide an opportunity for him to have a better perspective in what we do.  I told him that as he has time I could utilize him for analysis or other projects but not at the expense of his current job.  The bottom line is that <NAME/> is very good at his current role and he has expressed interest in trading.  I viewed this move as an opportunity to evaluate his trading potential while he is given the opportunity to see what trading is really like;  but I have no immediate plans to move <NAME/> into trading.  If the time ever comes that I would like bring him into trading I will certainly coordinate the transition with you.  I was under the impression that <NAME/> cleared all this with you before he moved.  It appears that he may have made this physical move more meaningful than it is and certainly more than I intend at this time.  How do you want to handle this?

Thanks <NAME/>.  The Dynegy folks took me to New York for the analyst prsentations and made a big deal about <NAME/>'s pipelines and about me coming over.  The only problem is they never asked me if I was planning on going over.  I know their CEO and COO very well so I will probably have a choice.  I would like to see this thing through.  I committed in my current contract to stay until 3/1/05 so I would like to keep my commitment even though the options they gave me sign the contract are worthless.  I do feel an obligation to help right the ship.  My businesses keep performing well and are anchoring the ship right now.  Employees are pretty scared so having some key executives stand up and commit to stay is pretty critical.  Either way I will be fine.  Thanks for your concern.  It means alot.

<NAME/>,
      I thought you had talked to <NAME/> about covering for <NAME/> on Friday afternoons.  She needs to know that "covering" means she needs to stay beyond 3:40 (at least until close of business), which is when she rushed out on Friday.  I had phones shifted over to <NAME/> after I got a call from <NAME/> looking to find <NAME/> or me.  If you haven't talked with her, I will I'd you'd prefer.

<NAME/>,

I have made discreet inquiries at Rice and it seems they are looking for somebody
with a different profile than the one you represent. I think that the interest is more
in a person with more financial institution risk management experience, with special applications
to trading and energy trading in particular.

Please read paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation.

It refers to the terminated transaction having "Reference number 1980816".

The confirmation that you  sent to me (for the terminated transaction) has a Reference number 1980815.  The termination confirmation is referenced as 1980816.

You need to correct paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation. Then the document can be executed.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

<NAME/> -- The biggest problem that I have experienced with emergency employee contact information during Tropical <NAME/> <NAME/> & during recent system outages is that all our contact lists are stored in an intranet environment.  When systems or the Internet are down, we can't get to the contact info.  I am now resorting to keeping a copy of customer contact info stored on a diskette.

 Are there any plans to store a copy of this info on a non-<NAME/> ISP that could be accessed from our Home ISP if the <NAME/> intranet or servers are down?

Dear <NAME/> , 

Welcome to the pleasure of planning an event for your asshole friends.
This has been a long standing tradition that the person that gets sucked or suckered
into planning an outing for the group gets bitched at non stop until the event happens.
The next step is "the event" that will be the turning point of this bitching.
There are two outcomes,
1.	Everyone has a good time and you will bitch back and it will be lessened to good friendly humor
2.	Everyone is pissed b/c they drove 100 miles , they play bad and blame you for picking a bad place to
	play, they kill you and bury you in a sand trap on the number 12 hole , finish the round and never mention
	your name again.

All I have to say <NAME/> is good luck on everyone play GOLF well this Sunday.

Live the next few days to the fullest , they might be your last.

Long live <NAME/>

<NAME/>

<NAME/> --

I agree with your arguments.  The other problem with SCE's analysis is that they had a DEFINED stranded cost amount and they deserve that money. 

What California did (my explaination) is that SCE was offered frozen rates for 4 years.  All of the margin they "earned" was shareholder's compensation for moving to direct access.  If the total $$ of margin was $0 or less, this implies simply that SCE had no generation stranded costs. 

The entire argument that SCE is making forgets the $Billion that they have kept from consumers through the fixed rate.

  <body>

Here's a cut at the taxonomy of regulatory risks associated with Direct Access. Please let  us know if the list looks about right.

FYI:  <NAME/> and I are scheduled to travel to Portland to sit down with <NAME/> Swain & Co. in the attempt to ensure that the folks managing the book are well briefed on the regulatory risks.

Finally, note that though the risks listed below are linked to PUC actions, the California Legislature could take actions that could trigger the same risks.  For example, the Legislature could pass a bill directing the PUC how to allocate costs associated with the utilties' undercollection, the bonds issued to recover general fund money used to purchase power, DWR's long term contracts, etc. 

Best,
<NAME/>
  
1.	Retroactive Suspension of DA Contracts:  The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date 	between July 1 and September 20th.  

2.	Contract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.

3.	No incremental "DASR'ing":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the 	suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)

4.	Cost allocation: The PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.  	Costs with the greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general 	fund, and DWR contracts.  The costs associated with these categories are substantial. 

Additional suggestions from <NAME/> Day:

5.	DASR processing :  If the utilities attempt to implement the Commission-ordered suspension in an onerous way, it may 	put at risk contracts executed prior to 09.20.01 but not yet DASR'd.

6.	Confidentiality of contract information:  The utilities and/or the PUC may require ESPs to show contracts as proof 		that contracts were executed prior to 09.20.01.

In order to expedite getting Non-Disclosure Agreements (Confidentiality Agreements) in place, it would expedite matters if the <NAME/> Credit Inc. followed the following procedures:

1.  Send all requests for NDAs by email directly to me, <NAME/> Jones
2.  The email should contain the correct legal name of the company and its address
3.  I will need a brief description of the nature of the business/project you are discussing with the customer
4.  Generally we will send out a bilateral NDA, but there are instances where only <NAME/> is providing confidential information, and we prefer to use that form whenever possible as it is much more favorable to <NAME/>.  Please indicate when you think you have such a situation.
5.  We have found it most helpful to send the NDAs to the counterparties by email directly from Legal.  I have a email letter that states:  "At the request of "dealmaker name" I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement. If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by <NAME/>.  If you have any comments or questions please call <NAME/> Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-3397 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you."  If you prefer, we can email the NDA to you to go out under you cover letter, or send it by fax or UPS.  Just let me know and I will do so.  Otherwise, I will email it as it speeds things up.
6.  Please indicate any special timing concerns (i.e., it needs to go out today, by lunch, we have a meeting Wednesday, whatever).  Generally they go out within 1-2 days of receipt of your email.

Upon receipt of this information I will do the conflicts check, prepare the NDA, and log the NDA into the list I keep of the <NAME/> Credit Inc. NDAs.  I hope this will make for a smooth process!  Thanks for your assistance.

Calif Energy Panel OKs First Step For 1160MW In Projects

10/18/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission has accepted as "data adequate" applications to build a 900-megawatt power plant and two peaker plants totaling 260 megawatts, a press release said. 

The data adequacy vote means an application has been accepted as having sufficient information to proceed with the commission's approval process.

<NAME/> Corp.'s (ENE) Roseville Energy Facility LLC unit has proposed building a 900-MW natural gas-fired plant in Sacramento, Calif., to be online by the fourth quarter of 2004. The construction cost will be $350-$450 million for the combined-cycle project, which will undergo a 12-month review process by the commission. 

GWF Energy LLC has applied to build the 169-MW Tracy Peaker Project, a simple cycle plant in the San <NAME/> Valley, Calif., that would be online by July 2002. Peaker plants operate during times of high electricity demand. 

The company also applied to build the 91-MW <NAME/> Peaker Project, 20 miles south of Hanford, Calif., which would consist of two turbine generators and come on line by June 2002. 

Electricity generated from the two peaker projects will be sold to the state's Department of Water Resources under a 10-year contract.

We have received a request to change UK power limit from $12.6MM VAR to $35MM. Quite sizeable but I spoke with <NAME/> <NAME/> and he seemed convinced it was necessary. Do you guys agree? What if it were $20MM? Skilling will definitely ask why such a large increase so I need to have your full support. <NAME/>

<NAME/>,

Attached is the estimated notional bid for the 10-year term gas (9/2001-8/2011) delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel.

The bid as of Tuesday's closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the following assumptions:

1)  Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the CGPR-Niagara curve.

2)  National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.  The desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the TCPL/Niagara system.

3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) size.

Let me know if you have any further questions.


Thanks,

<NAME/>

I checked further into the producer side of the deals that we have going to Boston.  The producers are well out of the money any do not seem excited about taking big losses via unwinding.  We need to come up with an attractive alternative.

Gulf Canada Energy	C$(19,427,920)
Suncor Energy		C$(19.861,007)
Petro Canada		C$(14,574,960)
Encal			C$(14,574,960)


<NAME/> Sangwine is a marketer here who could coordinate the restructuring.  He covers a couple of these producers and has pretty good relationships with them.

Example 1

Party A calculates that it is in the money $100 (which results in a "Loss" to Party A from the termination)
Party B calculates that it is out of the money $98 (which results in a "Gain" to Party B from the termination)
There are no Unpaid Amounts

The Payment Amount is 50 percent of ($100 + $98) = $99
Since the Payment Amount is positive Party B (the Party with the net Gain) pays $99 to Party A (the party with the net Loss)



Example 2

Same as example 1 except Party A owes $150 in Unpaid Amounts to Party B and Party B owes Party A $12 in Unpaid Amounts

The Payment Amount is (a) 50 percent of ($100 + $98) plus (b) $12 minus (c) $150 = negative $39
Since the Payment Amount is negative Party A (the party with the net Loss) pays $39 to Party B (the party with the net Gain)


Let me know if you need any further explanation.

I think the note I sent to <NAME/> plus the fact that he came to see me and I told him he was out of line are enough. We will not support the app. It seems kind of draconian to shut off the flow of information. As far as wireless in general it has never been a high priority for me because we never had a commercial basis for proceeding other than "gee, wouldn't this be cool" I think it is time to reassess the wireless angle, in terms of what it would cost to build, who would build it for us, and what we would get from the project. I'm going to ask <NAME/> Forster to do that.

We have decided not to make any reps about these plans, since any buyer would not be taking them.  However, we have a data room list that specifies what was made available, and the other side is welcome to review most of what is in that room.  We remain cautious about releasing employment compensation data and contract information about individuals, but are happy to provide totals of current and future costs under those agreements in the aggregate.  Let me know if you have questions.

Which deal are you actively working on?  Fire or Wind?  Do I need to be working on the draft agreement?

To get hard to find tickets, go to the Plaza Hotel (borders Central Park near FAO Schwartz) entering through the front door, proceed ahead around the big lobby/tea area around to the right and find a woman in a closet sized booth (literally a closet).  Cast members turn tickets over to her to sell that they are given for their shows.  She is completely independent from the hotel and I'm sure she pays huge rent for the tiny space that she has.  They are always wonderful seats to and usually run around $100+ for each ticket.  It is always a worth-it splurge if it is for a play you want to see.  I used to have her card, but it is long gone by now.  You might be able to call the Plaza and inquire as to her name and number and call ahead.  Otherwise, just stop in as soon as you get in town.
 
Rent is OK, but if this is your first and maybe only trip to NYC for a while, I would certainly recommend seeing other plays first .
 
I agree with <NAME/>, your best hotel bet is the Marriott <NAME/>, which is very nice for a Marriott and the location is the best.
 
<NAME/>'t forget to eat lox and a bagel for breakfast!
 
Keep us posted.

J, D, P and J,

Here is a previous email from the travel agency regarding car and ferry info.  I have asked Dee to book the overnight ferry from Palermo to Naples.  I believe that we still have a 6 hour drive to Lucca, but that will put us there sooner than the overnight ferry to Livorno with a 2 hour drive.  She is also confirming the car and rate for us (approx $742 for each car). 

FYI, I have received a few more faxes from available Rome Hotels, but none of them have a better location that what we have booked and a few of them were even more expensive than what we have booked.  <NAME/> is on the hunt for a <NAME/> hotel.  I will prepare faxes in mass for <NAME/> tonight and send them out tomorrow.  

<NAME/> called me yesterday and wanted to know how our plans are coming.  She and <NAME/> are very sad that they will not be able to join us.  I told her we will drink for them everyday and have them in our thoughts.  She is doing well and hopes to return to the office in about three weeks on a part time basis.

Also, <NAME/> and I are confirmed in a Rome hotel for the 11th-13th which is only about 5 blocks from the train station where we will return the cars.  We can put everyone's luggage in our room when we return to Rome and have a nice dinner before you guys taxi to the airport to return home.

I will keep you posted as we hear more. 

Thanks, <NAME/>.

I didn't save the email verison of the "corrections to published prices" so I'll state the changes below and you can revise:

(1)  You will need two different versions:  one for GTC's and the other for ISDA confirmations	

(2)  <NAME/>'t capitalize the word "party" in either version

(3)  Use the capitalized term "Interest Rate" for the GTC version

(4)  Use the capitalized term "Applicable Rate" for the ISDA version

When I hear back from <NAME/> T., we can finalize the rounding convention for online and offline confirmations.

They know you are picking up the tickets - you will need a photo id too. You need to be in your seats 30 minutes before the show - get a cocktail to take in - I recommend the 'O'.  You probably should pick up your tickets at an earlier time than the show as the queues are horrible  just before showtime.

<NAME/> and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in each.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around people availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The schedule that we have been working with that <NAME/> provided did not allocate two hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had not been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on that schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting that <NAME/> Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs through the evening hours..  Only because <NAME/> Perlman is out on Thursday for a religious holiday, I decided to "skip out" from this meeting to be here on Friday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets together.  In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orchestrated the time swap with <NAME/> Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW meeting at 3:00.  I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the commitment for <NAME/> Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution that works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, <NAME/>.

Scheduling issues aside, <NAME/> suggested that we also review with you the EES budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine the appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have done this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provided and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggested split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the decision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of the chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets together, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer block of time (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting at 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule that works for both of us. 

We will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the components of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of costs and projects in effect will serve as our "scope of engagement" discussion.  A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had been reached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for discussion on that.    --<NAME/>

Power providers cry foul over fees 
State is accused of improper billing 
Electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California's energy market are turning the tables on the state, saying its independent grid manager is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov. Gray <NAME/>' administration. 
The power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of high-priced electricity contracts. 
Energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney- Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such industry giants as <NAME/>, Dynegy, <NAME/> and Reliant. 
The charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour. 
"The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Water Resources is giving them," Smutney-Jones said. 
An industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged. 
The commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency. 
State officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared California could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the state had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought. 
<NAME/> Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to "bury" some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators. 
"The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control the governing board of the ISO," Ackerman said. 
The governor's spokesman, <NAME/> Maviglio, called the power firms' accusations "absolutely false" and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in Washington to interfere with the state's affairs. 
"The generators know they'll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in Washington than they will in Sacramento," Maviglio said. "It shouldn't be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement." 
<NAME/> Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California's energy crisis. 
"I don't feel sorry for them one bit," Hidalgo said. "They had one heck of a year." 
<NAME/> Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations. 
Energy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs. 
The extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers' bills for ISO operating costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said. 
Some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand-by power units on too-short notice. When they can't comply, they say, the ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost. 
The accusations are part of a struggle for control of California's grid. In January, <NAME/> disbanded the ISO's 26-member governing board, which was chaired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with industry. <NAME/> appointed his own five-member board. 
In February, then-FERC Chairman <NAME/> Hebert said the new board had become "a political arm of the governor." The commission is trying to get California to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization. 
<NAME/> has warned Washington to "keep its hands off" the ISO.

No go on the laon for both the current lot and the new house , 
I told my dad to drop the price to 198,500 
this would pay off the debt and get that taken care of but no profit
At this point we need to talk about the money that we would loose if we go forward but do not sell the lot 
it should be the cost of the upgrades at this point
lets talk later , i know this is what you were worried about so i want to talk with you before going forward

<NAME/>:

<NAME/> Heaney tells me that you have received information about non-terminated, defaulting P&P counterparties (on the financial side).  We are developing a strategy for handling these types of entities and I want to ensure that ENA responds/acts consistently.  Many of the P&P parties misinterpret the ISDA documents and I observe that many are in the money to ENA, have not terminated and may be in default for failures to pay or post collateral.  Can you let me know if you actively pursued these parties for <NAME/> Crane?

Thanks.  <NAME/>

THE WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE BRINGS HEAVY HITTERS TO HAAS
All faculty, students, staff, and alumni are invited to the 6th annual Women in Leadership Conference, which takes place on Saturday, October 20. This year's theme, "Explore, Inspire, Excel," is embodied by two exceptional keynote speakers: <NAME/> Dubinsky, founder, president, and CEO of Handspring, and <NAME/> Sawi, chief administrative officer and executive vice president of <NAME/> Schwab & Co., Inc. 

The annual WIL conference is the longest-running student-run conference at Haas. Last year it attracted more than 400 participants including current MBA and undergraduate students, alumni, and career women from the greater Bay Area.

Dubinsky gives the first keynote address of the day. She co-founded Handspring with <NAME/> Hawkins in July 1998 to create a new breed of hand-held computers for consumers. Before joining Handspring Dubinsky served as president and CEO of Palm Computing, where she helped make the Palm Pilot the best-selling hand-held computer and the most rapidly adopted new computing product ever produced. When Dubinsky first joined Hawkins at Palm Computing in 1992, shortly after the company was founded, she brought with her more than ten years of marketing and logistics experience from Apple and Claris. Dubinsky and Hawkins introduced the original Palm Pilot in February 1996, a move that revitalized the hand-held computing industry. She earned her BA from Yale University and her MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.

<NAME/> Sawi oversees Human Resources, Corporate Communications, Community Affairs, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, and Corporate Services. She is also a member of the executive committee for The <NAME/> Schwab Corporation. She will give the afternoon keynote address. 

Sawi is a long-time veteran of Schwab; she started her career at Schwab in 1982. From 1995 to 1997 she was executive vice president of Electronic Brokerage, during which time she headed Schwab's Internet launch. Sawi took a sabbatical in Italy in 1998-99 during which she wrote her book "Coming Up for Air: How to Build a Balanced Life in a Workaholic World," published by Hyperion in February 2000. She received a BA from Tufts University and an MBA from the <NAME/> University Graduate School of Business. 

Throughout the day, conference attendees will interact with leaders from a variety of professional backgrounds through the conference's panel sessions and workshops. Panels planned for this year's conference include: 
+ Management Techniques to Inspire and Motivate 
+ Women and the New Economy - Women in the Tech World 
+ International Business 
+ Wild Women 

This year's conference is sponsored by Fortune, Ford, Chevron, Genentech, J.P. Morgan, Johnson & Johnson, Accenture, Goldman Sachs, and Adobe.

<NAME/> --
 
My thoughts on the filing.
 
1.    Pretty hard line with Comm Wood.  I don't have any problems with it as written, but comments like "CYA not Calif Youth Admin" is not appropriate.
2.    We don't deal with the requirement to submit contracts?  Should AReM address this?  My understanding is that for contracts with customers below 20kw we need to submit something (maybe with the price and term blacked-out)?  Is this correct?
3.    In the conclusion, don't we want to ask the PUC to take some affirmative action - tell the industry that they will never implement retroactive suspension, that their is no cost shifting, and that DA customers can extend without penalty?  The filing simply asks for no harm.  
 
Thanks,

<NAME/>

When you talk to <NAME/> Neustaedter, ask him about the Montebello storage field in Socal's territory that was blown down this year. I would like to know what application they filed, when it started and a summary of the details regarding this deal.

There was about 14 Bcf blown down.

I didn't want to talk price with him.  He saw our ERCs (that we just sold for $15,000) on website and called <NAME/>'s line.  I was told to pick up the phone.  I told him somebody would call him back.  Either you or I would if you didn't want to call him.  He wanted to move fast, and he mentioned he used brokers in the past.  

If none are out, I think we should call and tell him.

<NAME/>: 

Thanks for the information on the task at hand regarding operational risk.  We will certainly name an appropriate person from Operations to be involved in this project, and will work with you to help in achieving your objectives.  There doesn't appear to be anyone from ETS on your distribution list.  Operational risk is broad and would seem to be present in all of <NAME/>'s businesses.  Is the initial focus simply on the "wholesale businesses", or is there an intent to make this enterprise-wide? 

I suspect that it would be helpful for all of us on the distribution list to have a context for the way in which you see this RAC initiative complementing, replacing, overlapping, or perhaps duplicating the work of EAS, AA's internal audit engagement, the critical self assessment process being piloted in London this year by the operations team in conjuction with the AA audits, Doorstep reviews, current operational risk reporting done by the various operations teams, and our major initiatives for EES tracked every other Thursday with you and <NAME/> Causey.   Before we each choose our appropriate representatives from our respective areas, it might be constructive to cover this in a kick-off meeting with the addressees on your memo. 

I might also suggest that we work to clearly define roles and responsibilities at the beginning of this project.  The creation of a framework for quantifying enterprise-wide operational risk is perhaps different from the implementation of daily processes or systems that are used at the business unit levels.  As on other policies devised by RAC, it would seem that implementation of anything new to meet reporting requirements against the to-be-developed operational risk policy should rest with the appropriate business unit/functional area outside RAC.  The cross-functional team that will be formed is probably best used to give input to RAC in creating the policy, but may not necessarily be the right body for implementation of specific initiatives. 

Finally, the second bullet point in <NAME/>'s list below is already being addressed through the project that you and I agreed upon in August to insure that information from all source systems to RisktRAC is complete, accurate and efficiently handled. As you and I discussed, this is a global effort spanning all commodities/all locations/all source systems.   We have formed a steering committee with appropriate project managers and have worked closely with <NAME/> Brackett in defining the scope, approach, key milestones, resource requirements and projected timeline (Project Greenlight).  A team of stakeholders from Operations, IT and <NAME/> Brackett will meet tomorrow in order to review the project plan with <NAME/> Port and <NAME/> <NAME/> for final input.  My assistant is working with yours to set up a meeting then for <NAME/> and me to review the work done to date and to review the proposed plan and timeline.   Assuming that you are comfortable with Project Greenlight when we review the details with you,  I think that it would be appropriate to take this item off of the <NAME/>'s list.  We can certainly update the cross-functional team on efforts underway, but there is no need for a new team to focus on this bullet point. 

<NAME/>

<NAME/>, my marketer out of the Portland office had word that a EES marketer ( <NAME/> Dickinson ) was looking to contact a Utility in the Northwest.... the reason that EES was looking to do this was to work with the utility on gas structures that perhaps the utility could market to some of their customers and EES would help them create or structure ..

This marketing effort is at the core of what ENA - Wholesale Gas is trying to promote and any third part mix into this effort does not help. 

Regardless as to where we are at in our marketing efforts and success to date in these efforts.... Utility business is a ENA customer and I consider them a primary wholesale customer.

I have not discussed this is anyone at EES but in my discussions with my peers was led to believe that this issues was tabled with you already and my comments would support your conversations with EES on our behalf.

Pls advise if you need to discuss or require anything from me.

regards,

Here is a list of the types of deals that always fail:
GDD Dawns deals EOL#2054274
Physical dawn deals fail - EOL will only let one trader map their deals to one physical book(don't think you can fix this one) EOL#2047749
Mich basis swaps EOL #2054712

This should be a comprehensive list.  Thanks.

Thanks for the information on the GB 58. This boat far exceeds what I want. After the show I concluded that  either a 42 or 46 foot classic is most appropriate for my needs. Would like to also consider the 36 foot model. Thanks for the info though and keep me in mind. I enjoyed talking to you at the boat show and my wife was quite sold on the GB line (after looking at most everything there in detail).

As I mentioned I am in no particular rush as I probably have a year before I want to go forward on this but if something exciting came up, either new or used, I may be interested. Again, I would need your help in obtaining appropriate dockage( in someone's backyard!)

Thanks, <NAME/> Buy

Hi everyone!!

	For those of you I haven't met personnally, my name is <NAME/> Hyatt.  I am currently chairing the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power Conference 2002 to be held in March.  You are receiving this email because you have previously expressed an interest in serving on the committee.  

Attached below is the current subcommittee track agenda with the 4 sessions and each session's speaking topics.  The track and topics were developed over the last 3 months with various inputs from committee members and the Trade Fair Group staff.

Our current challenge is finding speakers for items 1, 6, and 15 (highlighted in red).  If you move your cursor over the topic, the comment box will appear outlining in a little better detail what info we are trying to present for the conference attendees.  

I am working on lining up several speakers but as of yet have only confirmed one from Calpine.  What I need each of you to do is review the agenda, think about who you may know who would be a good speaker for the topic, then call them to see if they are interested.  Speeches should last no more than 30 minutes with a Q&A period afterward.  

If possible, please email or call me with your results by Friday 10/26.  Interested speakers will receive a formal invitation from the Trade Fair Group confirming their attendance.    

Thanks for your help.  <NAME/>'t hesitate to call me (713-853-5559) or <NAME/> Shapiro (713-463-9595 x307) with any questions!!

A few notes.

1.	Be cautious about divestiture.  Remember we own pipes and a electric LDC.

2.	Agree with you that we don't want Utility in merchant role - key issue.

3.	POLR issue involves getting pricing right.

Why don't you put together a note to the CAEM that we can send as our thoughts.  Just the Top 5 issues.

<NAME/> - thanks for your note. Following are my thoughts. First, I am not going to Netco. (Long story). Second, I have spoken with <NAME/> Lay and <NAME/> McMahon about the continuation of RAC and my leading it. They both want RAC to continue and want me to lead it and also combine an internal audit function with RAC as well (to be determined more definitively). 

<NAME/> has also requested that some RAC folks be near his operation as you have which I totally understand. I think I will assign a couple people to his floor but keep the bulk of our operation on 28. We have counterparty credit files on 15,000 counterparties as well as Dash libraries and other info that require large secure space.

My final issue is that I have had three credit people leave this week so my situation is getting critical. I need to get Netco people away from 28 and get remaining RAC people sitting together and feeling like a team. Everyone is looking and the market is hot for our credit and market risk people. 

I hope this addresses your issue.

Thanks so much for the call back.  Here it is.  It's got temperature and %RH from end of May to early November.  Couple of things.  I tried to keep and save heat days (cumulative) on the graph, but for some reason, it won't stick.  I'm assuming that you know how to add just about anything you want to the graph.  If not, let me know. 

Also, the data should be cut off for about a week at both the front end and the back end (to account for the time that it was in my apartment prior to setting in up on the property, and before I was able to download it in November).  Once you get a chance to look at, give a call and let me know what you think.  

If the temperature range looks like it's around the ballpark for vines, I'll want to get Terry Rosetti up to do some soil testing, but wanted to get your take on the temperature, etc. first.  Really appreciate all your help.  My number is 415.782.7822.

Best,
<NAME/>

I think we have had our release reviewed by NY counsel already, but it might be a belts and suspenders idea to have Drew look at it quickly.

I agree with Lizzette's view of the persons who don't sign the release; I believe that they probably have quit.  If, however, they rescind their application before termination, it is not a voluntary term.  If the situation arises, however, I think we should reevaluate at that time.

With the daily chaos that ensues on this floor, sometimes communication is sacrificed.  Fortunately, we have the message board to facilitate real time sharing of information.  I think all of us, including myself, underutilize this tool.  I want to encourage everybody to keep the board open on their computers all day long.  In addition, I want everybody to post at least one message every day.  This can be an interesting trade that just happened, what counterparties are trying to do, new information you uncovered, etc.  Information we learn can be very valuable to other desks and it is only fair that if we're taking info from the board, we should be contributing as well.

This looks like it will work.  Since there has been some confusion around this, I'll lay out what I think will happen with this language.

Assumption #1:

MC on EOL is 300 at 350.
COB is not displayed on EOL.

Product 1 is COB; Product 2 is MC

COB/MC Spread is 5 @ 10 on EOL

Situation #1
Customer lifts the COB/MC spread at $10.  <NAME/> will then BUY the MC at $325 and SELL COB at $335.

Situation #2
Customer hits the COB/MC spread at $5.  <NAME/> will then SELL the MC at $325 and BUY COB at $329.


This is how it should work.

I suggest we test things out now, and see how it works.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

<NAME/>,

This spreadsheet is an attempt to outline supply & demand in San <NAME/> by unit.  Next, I want to look at the numbers by bedroom.  Let's compare numbers.

Here is a list of questions:

1.	Unit mixes of all proposed projects.
2.	Completion date of  Blazer Development (220), Capstone (270), Melrose (202), Bonner-Carr. (186)
3.	Is the Capstone 270 units or 270 beds?


 
This spreadsheet illustrates that supply will exceed demand in 2002 but demand will catch up in 2003-2005.  San <NAME/> will have over 6,000 units.  If the 350 excess units in 2002 were distributed over the entire population that would push occupancy down by 5%.  That would not be a disaster.

Tomorrow, I would like to refine this spreadsheet and try to support some of the population and job growth assumptions with more current data.

Let me know what you think.

looks like Florida will not be very good next year.  They are losing their best players to the draft.  All three of their receivers and their best cornerback and offensive linemen have now declared for the draft today.  Add to that they can not get a coach to sign on.  Shanahan just turned it down, they are now going to New Orleans offensive coordinator.  See what happens.  Did you get your pool cover fixed?

I called time warner and basically we were on a 6 month trial package of hbo and showtime for 9.95.  After 6 months, the rate goes to 12.95 - they charged us for hbo, showtime, and cinemax which should be 16.95 but they overcharged us in addition to the fact that we don't currently get cinemax.  I went ahead and ordered the 3 channel package (with cinemax) and they are crediting us for 19.95 for the overcharge.  Going forward the package will be 16.95 or we can cancel cinemax and save 4.00 a month.

Officially tired of watching the news.  Actually there is very little new about it.  Channel 12: the local viewpoint.  CNN: the national viewpoint.  CNBC:  the business viewpoint.  ESPN: the sports viewpoint.  <NAME/> Robertson Channel: God's viewpoint.  The politicians all hold news conferences and talk for 15 minutes and say nothing.  "We interrupt the State Dept's news conference to bring you the Justice Dept's news conference where we expect there going to say 'no comment at this time' frequently."  I have a tv on my desk at work that is on constantly just in case something happens, but meanwhile it's driving me nuts.
Just found out another girl I knew is missing. I was supposed to go out with this girl a couple years ago on a blind date but it never went through.  I met her after that.

<NAME/> --

Do you have a listing of all bonds that EES (and its affiliates) has in place for retail marketing, including wholesale ISOs? Speaking with <NAME/>, we don't keep this information in Govt Affairs.  <NAME/> Fite keeps bond information required in the State licensing processing.  The place that I think that is missing is Wholesale Service providers (e.g., ISOs).

I think that we need to expand this idea of Bonding to "Financial Guarantees" including with Utilities, States, and Wholesale Service Providers.

Maybe the best way to start is to work backwards from EES active markets and determine what is needed in each locale?

I believe it was $610.  That was (2X$195) + (4X$55).  The two I have are Sec 15 Row 18 Seats 1&2.

I meant season tix.  But would probably also try to get OU as well.  I guess I'm wrestling with the idea of getting them in my name, but I know the seat location would not be very good.  I really would like to have 4 season ticket seats together.  I have been getting these through you for 6 years now and don't have a problem with just continuing this arrangement.

Lets try it and then try to gauge whether it is accomplishing anything.  I believe our employees are on information overload and putting out another newsletter adds to the overload.  I have always believed that if we have an effective Corporate newsletter we don't need these subsidiary newsletters.  Meaningful information can be included in the corporate newsletter.  At ETS we used to have periodic FYI newsletters that were directed at key topics we needed to cover.

You and I also need to do a budget review.  The cost I am hearing from your group are to big for EGS to support.  I had truly hoped that <NAME/>'s group combined with you and perhaps one other person could cover EGS.  <NAME/>'s group was covering ETs and EOTT.  I think <NAME/> has a PR person so we need to find out what PR costs are in the Wind company.  Also NBP's has there own PR person.

Here are my comments given my very short review of the NGA Statement.

18.3.4	Demand Response 	GOOD

18.5	Improving Energy Transmission	OK	
	talks about "equal access for all suppliers"  
	even though says "oppose preemption", indicate a willingness to better coordinate

18.6	Regulatory 
	hard to read if the section on "no preemption of state regulatory authority" is good or bad...we don't argue that our model preempts any authority, only that transmission service is best defined by FERC.

Why not point out that we are always adjusting employment levels across our businesses.

Souad would need to roll up to the Central desk in natural gas, I would say she should be set up similar to <NAME/> Plachy.

FBI agents have parked in my reserved parking spot in the new <NAME/> garage Wednesday through Friday this week (#450).  The spot is clearly marked reserved, and as you know it is money out of my pocket for that reserved space.   I have left a polite note on the intruding car on Thursday and Friday, asking that the Reserved status be observed, as there are many unused, non-reserved parking spaces in the garage.  

I have put up with this for 3 days.  If the FBI will be back here next week, however, I will grow tired of this.  Is there some way to communicate with them so that they observe the Reserved parking spaces?  

I know that you have bigger issues at hand, but my concern is that if their visits to the building are extended, that I will be paying for a Reserved parking space that I never get to use!  

Thanks.  --<NAME/>

your guys are probably seeing this as well, but, 50 cents higher our customer biz was 95/5 from buy side.  now it's 50/50.  can almost smell blood among the producers.  only problem is trade is sooooo short they cant see straight.  were the market still not so fundamentally overvalued right now i'd be looking for a 25 cent move up.  just can't see that happening at this level though.

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 
This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 
In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 
Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 
But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California <NAME/>, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 
As massive as the <NAME/> deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 
Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 
Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 
Duress alleged
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 
"We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said <NAME/> Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." 
Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 
<NAME/> Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San <NAME/>, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 
"The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 
"Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. 
Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 
Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San <NAME/> attorney <NAME/> Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray <NAME/> overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 
He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
"To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." 
The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
"First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said <NAME/> Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.
Willingness to deal
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 
The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 
Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 
For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
"In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said <NAME/> Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." 
Some experts believe <NAME/> wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 
Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
"The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said <NAME/> Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 
The San <NAME/> company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 
Sempra says contract fair
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 
San <NAME/>-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 
<NAME/> Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 
"It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. 
But V. <NAME/> White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 
White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
"There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 
"But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?" 
*****************************************************************
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
OC Register, 10.07.01
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 
Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 
The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 
Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 
"We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) <NAME/> <NAME/> is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said <NAME/> Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 
A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 
In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 
Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides, an authority board member. 
Said <NAME/>: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 
Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 
The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 
The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 
Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 
"I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said <NAME/> Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 
Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 
Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 
Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 
"I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said <NAME/> <NAME/>, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 
The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is <NAME/>, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of <NAME/>' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 
The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
"It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman <NAME/> Keeley, D-<NAME/>, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 
Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 
<NAME/> said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
"The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' <NAME/> said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

My gut tells me that some of these folks we are hiring don't fit that well with the current strategic direction of <NAME/> (Although I'm sure they are very high quality individuals).  If its not too late, I wonder if we should slightly scale back the number of Associates that we are attempting to hire.

The California PUC
<NAME/> Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR.
In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.

The Legislature
The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.
It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.
Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between <NAME/>' office and business customers):
Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those "involuntarily" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for <NAME/>'s undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for <NAME/>'s remaining customers.
Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for <NAME/>'s undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for <NAME/>'s remaining customers.
Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for <NAME/>'s remaining customers.
Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.
There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.
Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by <NAME/> (if he signs it), i.e., the "effective date" of the bill.
So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.
After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.
Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from <NAME/>'s undercollection and DWR charges.
Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.
Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.
At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.

i believe it is the same country code as US, but not sure.  

it's been bad here at work for the last few weeks and its going to take awhile for things to get better, i'm just hoping it doesn't get any
worse.  it was very dicey for awhile - thought ene was going tits up.  

spanish desk sounds great!  say hi to kristian and paul for me, but we should catch up by phone, if possible, so i'll leave it there.

I realize that the timing of the <NAME/> Net Works All Employee Meeting last Friday made it difficult for the Gas Logistics Team to attend.  For future all-employee events within ENW, we will try to schedule times that work best for all employees.  I didn't want you to be left out in this case, so I have worked with <NAME/> Superty to set up another meeting for the Logistics team so that we can share with you the information that was covered last Friday.  I hope that you will be able to join me for this second meeting.  We have two videos that were made for the all-employee meeting that I think you will enjoy seeing.  We will also review the slides that were used in the discussions and have time for questions and answers.

Sorry its all prepetition.

I already claimed the flights, now I will not be using them as I can not go home.  I am using the money to pay for my parents's flights although not all of the money will be used.  The rest of the money I intend to offset against expense checks which bounced.    Should there be an imbalance - I will sort this out with <NAME/> once payments have been completed on expense checks.

OK?

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you $1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?  what you charge me play against you?)

For 01 and 02, congestion/energy uplift/transmission uplift is $3.50 to $4.50/Mwh.   Current EES curves are light in this area.

For 03 & beyond when LMP is adopted in NE ISO and socialized allocation is eliminated, the congestion component alone in the Boston area will be well over $10/Mwh (based on actual congestion $'s from May 99 to date in the Boston area).

Much like the Dallas situation, these locational congestion charges can be significant and <NAME/> and <NAME/> will begin immediately developing delivered energy pricing curves for specific locations that go well beyond the wholesale pricing points we mark right now.

I hope this helps.

I need to you to purchase Oasis for me for Friday, Sat, Sun, and Monday.  I am unable to do it because it must be done the day b4... so tomorrow (Thurs) I will need to buy Fri Oasis.. Friday you will be able to buy Oasis for Sat, Sun and Monday.  The ramp is set and you will need to see what gets accepted on the NY side to make sure the ramp matches the volumes accepted in NY.


--- The PJM ID # is N78958 << this is the PJM schedule where the ramp and Oasis needs to be purchased.
--- The NY ID # is 5039123 << this is NY schedule that is flowing.

--- PJM will ask you if NY IS # 5043451 is flowing? The answer is no.

Thanks.   Any assignment would have to be confidential.   I don't view an assignment any different than the unwinds that we are currently doing directly with the customer.   If there is a positive NPV trade, we should do it.   "Assignment" maybe the wrong word.   Maybe we can transfer the ERCOT switching risk to another supplier or back to the customer.

1.  NNG and ENA are entirely separate entities and our businesses are run entirely separate from one another.

2.  Customers may think that they can net ENA invoices against NNG invoices.  NNG is a separate business and is not responsible for ENA invoices to their customers.

3.  Should suppliers cut volumes for ENA; NNG will cut the market accordingly.

4.  Creditworthiness status for ENA remains the responsibility of the Commercial Department. We are to maintain our normal course of business until instructed otherwise.

Attached is the curve file for phys and gas daily.  I made this extremely simple on our first pass, but I left in the tabs that were in the old/current file.  All you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locations(yellow column).  This will then set the gas daily curve.  We will continue to true up to gas daily each day.  You may want to also reset the next day's curve as well, since this is a hardcode, you simply type over the previous day's load.  The phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it.  We can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like.  I figure you will want to keep your model and I can pull info from there as well.  I simply wanted to start out at a baseline and build it to best fit your needs.  Please let me know what you would like to see changed and we will do it.  Thanks.

I received this email from <NAME/> Taylor at <NAME/> Field Services.  I have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ENA could purchase 3rd party gas on the <NAME/> Gas Gathering system.  As you can see, a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us, but are unwiling to tell us directly.  I hope this is a short term problem, as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions.  I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty <NAME/>.

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.

1.	Form <NAME/> Negotiation Team

	My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + <NAME/> Dasovich.  My understanding was that <NAME/> M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  <NAME/> should only be there to make introductions.

2.	Meet & Confer (10/29)

	<NAME/> <NAME/> and <NAME/> Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.	Reformed Stipulation

	I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.	Meeting

	My understanding is that (<NAME/> D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.

Thanks,

<NAME/>,
 
When you get in tomorrow, could you please check whether the direct flight on the 15th cleared.  If not, please advise which flight path I'm currently cleared on.  
 
I don't want to lose the return home through Moscow on the 31st (waitlisted also for 29th or 30th); but I may also need to return immediately after my court date from Almaty on Dec 23 (in such case my husband would fly back to Moscow to pick up our daughter after the 1st of the year).   I would like to make such a reservation is possible.
 
I think you can probably let all the other waitlisted items go for me.

I like these homes much better than the one from earlier this week.  I like the steeper pitched roof and the high glass windows in the top of the gables.  Plus  these seem a little bigger.  I like the floor plan of the hoover plan better than the van gendersen.  The kitchen should be bigger.  You could take some space from the sewing room and add an island to the kitchen.

By the way, I don't think I finished my thought when we were talking about this earlier today.  Yes, you are correct that PNR revenue was only $1,200 in July.  Due to higher swings in the SoCal window causing higher line pack, parks were not made available most of the month.  TK continues to challenge our ability to accomodate PNR's.  The Daily Balancing Report is helping us to recognize opportunities for this service.

Thanks, <NAME/>.

<NAME/>, concerning the environmental liabilities which may impact Transwestern if <NAME/> should direct the liquids from their 8" line into the pipeline liquids tank at Wt-1, I have a concern.  

The liquids that are generated in the 8" line are exempt from hazardous waste regulations (RCRA) as long as they stay in the <NAME/> line and are not transfered and collect in a mainline tank.  Because WT-1 is a mainline compressor station, any chemicals or compounds which are regulated under Subtitle C of RCRA  become the responsibility of the owner of the mainline tank.  Within the past few years, we have experienced the collection of regulated liquids at Wt-1 which were not placed there by Tranwestern.  Chemicals which producers and processing, upstream of Wt-1, have placed downhole to enhance gas production and other agents such as corrosion inhibitors and pipeline solvents have found their way into our tank and we have paid for the disposal.  Unfortunately, there is no way to segregate the bad materials from the good recycleable materials.

Based upon this, I would recommend that we not allow Dukes pipeline liquids to collect into our tank.

Below is an update from the weekend's activities.

The group negotiating the core/noncore proposal met over the weekend to attempt to put the proposal into legislative language/format.  
The product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments provided and discussions that took place today. He will  distribute a new draft by noon tomorrow (PDT).
The plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to Hertzberg by COB tomorrow (Monday).
As expected, some in the group are attempting to "recontract" certain portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin.
The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal.
Senator <NAME/> has still not definitively committed to a conference committee to produce a bill to deliver to <NAME/>.
In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought initially.
<NAME/> have more information tomorrow on where <NAME/> and the bond legislation stand.

Best,
<NAME/>

I am sorry that you are having problems with <NAME/>.  I am proud that you are doing the right thing and welcoming a new person at school.  It can be very dificult to be the new kid at a new school.  It sounds like <NAME/> feels threaten by you and others being friendly to this new girl.  I know it is hard but some how you need to reassure <NAME/> that you being nice to the new girl does not mean she (<NAME/>) is less of your friend.  Maybe the best approach is to ask <NAME/> how she would feel if she had to move to a new school and was treated badly by some of the new girls she met.  You and <NAME/> have been friends for a long time and you don't want to lose that, but she needs to know that you will continue to welcome new kids that come school and it does not impact your friendship with her.

To answer your question, things are OK.  There is still a lot of uncertainty with the Dynegy and <NAME/> merger and it is not going to be fixed any time soon.  All I can do is try to do the best job I can and let everything else work itself out.

I am going to an NWAL meeting tonight at 7:30 so I will see you probably about bed time.

Thanks for writing to me.

We have a response back from the Hotel Firenze (same hotel we stayed in before) in Rome for the last two nights of our trip (June 7 & 8) that they do have availability.  The rate is Euro 155.00 (according to the conversion rate I think this is about USD $136) for each room all including.  They will need credit card info if we want to confirm.

I have not heard from the Hotel Conditti ( which is the hotel we had reservations for back in September and is located closer to the Spanish Steps than the Hotel Firenze) and hope to hear from them soon.  

I have also not heard back from the Marincanto Hotel in Positano.  I'll keep you posted. 

I thought we would give the Hotel Conditti another day to respond before making our decision.  If Conditti does not have space or is too pricey, are we OK with booking the Hotel Firenze?  I have not checked into other Rome hotels.  Let me know if you would like me to investigate others.

Please advise.

Thanks, <NAME/>.

TK,

Are you referring to the Dynegy deal in December being the "I to I" deal that we have already hedged?  Have you already included the previous "I to I" deals that you have done earlier in the year?  Outside of these deals, I am not aware of any others.

Here are my thoughts --

1.	Agree that offering Transmission Provider waiver given RTO status is premature.
2.	Maybe strengthen argument that both unbundled Provider of Last Resort type service and bundled Utility sales service should be included in the affiliate definition.  At a minimum, in places like PA, where the Utility sales service is a direct competitor, there should be no difference with any competitive player.  In a state like GA, where the Utility sales service is a "monopoly" by statue (i.e., bundled retail), I still think given the ability to cogenerate, it makes sense to have these providers take transmission service similar to our service at wholesale.  Maybe make this argument earlier and as the core focus.  I fully agree to include these providers in the definition.
3.	<NAME/>, call <NAME/> N. to discuss examples of how Native Load Exemption has caused problems (we've put in earlier filings).
4.	The question of "Holding Company, etc." -- We should argue for an exemption.
5.	I am also troubled by the "administer" term.  FERC should prohibit any "helping" by the Transmission Provider of anyone in the marketplace.  Maybe focus FERC on clarifying its positions.
6.	Emergency sections -- Keep the language you have that never applied to natural gas industry (and could be a real problem given a CAISO type situation - ask <NAME/> Comnes for thoughts).  Probably don't object but want to make sure that if Emergency develops there must a pre-set timeframe for going back to normal business.
7.	Everything filed at the FERC related to Standards of Conduct should be posted on the OASIS.

I didn't understand the final bullet point comments.  Is this policy or a statement of something to come?

Hi Mom,

Things are a little better here for me, Friday was a horrible day, we had layoffs of about 30% of our office.  Lots of crying and sadness on the floor.   The weekend was strange, <NAME/> came back from <NAME/> un announced which was not what we agreed to, and I got the feeling that he was thinking he was going to 'catch' me doing something or having someone over.  He is still really struggling with the idea that I just can't love him like a wife anymore, and that is not enough to keep two people together.  I wish that I could make this easier on him, and I almost think that if I had been unfaithful it would be easier for him to accept.

I am just trying to hold on until he gets some kind of income so that we can sell the house and pay our debt. I do not have any desire for him to be forced to live with his parents, I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Just pray for him and for me.

School sounds wonderful, I am so glad you are happy dealing with your little ones. How fun!  

I love you!

I spoke with <NAME/> Ng (who is not a lawyer!).  <NAME/> would like for <NAME/> Gas Liquids Inc. and ERAC to sign the "mini-netting" agreements she has already negotiated with EEFT through <NAME/> Simons.  Morgan does not need to execute this "mini-netting" agreement with ENA.  Morgan would be interested, however, in seeing the ENA form of Master Netting Agreement which they may also agree to sign.  But for the immediate future, the EEFT version is their primary goal.

ENA will execute an assignment with ELFI and Morgan to accept ELFI's positions in the four financial trades.

<NAME/>,

I finally got in touch with the department that handles stock options.  Unfortunately, they are committed to Paine Webber for the foreseeable future.  The two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationship were an exclusive contract with Paine Webber and the reporting and tax interfaces that are already in place.  They are less concerned with the services that Paine Webber doesn't offer the employees such as lending against vested options.  

It was worth a try.

Had a great weekend and looking forward to next time.  <NAME/> you made it back to town ok.  I had no problems but I think you should just assume that from the Newark airport it's at least 2.5 hours, probably a bit more.  The <NAME/> lady didn't bat an eye; of course I stood towards the back of the car so she wasn't really looking at the front and there was a big line forming behind me so she was in a hurry.  Did the kids get away even close to on time?

Thanks again!

My other comments on the tariff sheets were as follows:

Section 35.2
	2nd paragraph, 3rd sentence.  Explanation of "incremental revenue".  When we talk about revenues which TW already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.  What if we're taking bids on future capacity and we're trying to get revenue that is incremental to reservations charges we're not necessarily being paid yet?  The language is so specific.  Can we change the language to refer to revenues incremental to what TW already has contractually committed?

	2nd paragraph, last sentence.  The phrase "guaranteed throughput volume service applies only in the case of a negotiated rate".  What does this mean?  TK & I were both a littles confused by this language.

	4th paragraph, 4th sentence.  The phrase "the value of the index based rate bids will be calculated using the applicable published indices available on the bid deadline".  TK, is the phrase "published indices" generic enough or should we use something broader that might encompass basis quotes?  I realize it will probably have to be something that is published.

Is this change only for those using EnPower?  My group will no longer be running any power books and won't need EnPower any longer.

Here are my edits to the FAQ document.  Sorry but I don't understand the pool allocation response.  

 

My notes indicate that we also need to answer the questions
- where storage allocation notices appear 
- why storage allocation notices come out at a later time.

Fixes already put in place
In the follow-up letter we categorize the feedback.  Can't we go one step further and say that we have already addressed some items:

- Make customers aware that they can call HotTap Helpdesk for calls
- Raise awareness of need to minimize mrongin meetings
- <NAME/>'t we taken a step to notify EDI customers about system downtime
- We have taken the step of immediately notifying customers of system outages
- Aren't we adding an injection/withdrawal indicators
- Can't we immediately change the confusing descriptors "storage analysis completed" vs "storage allocations completed"  {See my suggestion in FAQ}

This will become the tour location with a description of the regional markets and the energy hubs within those super regions.   It will also help our traders get accustomed to electrically significant areas whether than NERC regions.

<NAME/> and I are dividing up <NAME/> postions (<NAME/> taking Peak, I'm taking Off-Peak).   To make it fair on everyone, I am allowing <NAME/> to take $4 million from Prudency C attached to JEA.  (<NAME/> has created this positive balance himself over the past 12 months with deals he has done in FL & SOCO).

In addition, I will be assuming all customer deals (VEPCO, JEA, Associated, MPMUC).

We will mark the curves in Entergy and TVA where <NAME/> is comfortable taking the position (off-peak also needs to be marked down).  The $4 million from prudency will absorb most of the curve shift.   All of <NAME/> postions will stay in Wholesale.

All parties come out with a fair solution.

SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray <NAME/> is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis. 
The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged <NAME/> last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan. 
With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis. 
"That is one scenario," <NAME/> spokeswoman <NAME/> McLean said Wednesday when asked about the proposal. "There are a number of different scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced." 
Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before they could be marketed to investors. 
<NAME/> wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes. 
The PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to the <NAME/>-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue. 
The PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that authority. It rejected the <NAME/> plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its president, <NAME/> appointee <NAME/> Lynch. 
<NAME/> earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market. 
The plan now under review, however, would bypass that. 
The DWR would not directly set rates, but under the <NAME/> plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers' utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect, guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street. 
The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes. 
Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations, but questioned whether <NAME/> had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates. 
"I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great," Lynch said. "But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of those two things." 
The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the payback plan. By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by Senate Leader <NAME/> <NAME/>, D-San <NAME/>. 
<NAME/> opposes <NAME/>'s bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers. The power companies' contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority, which <NAME/> believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute. 
If <NAME/> signs the order soon, the bonds could go to market early next year. Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion shortfall in other income.

Vladi asked me to give you a call.  I will be out of the office until about 2:00 today so I wanted to let you know what we did to populate Form A.
We gave all post-id's that were calculated on Nov-30th to Zhiyong Wei.  From there, he dumped all of that information into excel and we formatted it from there into the required buckets.  It will take a few hours for IT to get the file ready to use so I recommend getting that together ASAP.

Let me know what I can do to help.

Not much said about our group, except he has a direct line to Walley and has spoken with Dynegy.  He feels like they are excited to get us and that they mentioned "that they are good at being number 2."  He also mentioned a few companies have asked if the coal group was for sale as a whole.  He listened but told them no thanks.  Sounds like a few small changes in our group but nothing drastic.  <NAME/> did say we have working capital (we didn't for 2 days).  Not sure if that means coal or coal and emissions.

Didn't specify what groups will be hit the hardest, he only said EGM and EIM. 

Oh, by the way my job offers are pouring as well.  To many to count!!!!!  It is hard to do work with all the head hunters calling him every hour.  Oh wait, just kidding!

As such, I was wondering if you guys planned to do the same, and if so, (following up on your note <NAME/>), it would be totally fucking cool to play golf Sunday morning (particularly since I have not desire to sit around a and watch football).  You guys up for golf?  You plan on doing the anniversary thing?

Calpine is in complete disarray right now, and the entire future of their company hinges on CA honoring their long term above market contracts.   Calpine's non-CA portfolio is getting killed and I don't think they have hedged effectively in the non-CA locations.

Given these circumstances, the word "below market" is an "f" word, particulary with the legal concerns they also have.   I would place a low probability on getting to a value proposition that makes sense for both parties at Dighton, particularly with the legal issues.

<NAME/>,

A quick comment about seating arrangements for the weather group. I understand the
new plan is to put both the gas and power weather guys at one location.

My recommendation is against it. If the objective of having two separate weather
groups is to put in place a system of checks and balances and encourage independent views,
the new seating arrangements will nullify it. The power weather guys will 
defer to <NAME/> who has unquestionable authority and experience.

If we go ahead with the new seating arrangements it makes sense to combine the two groups
under <NAME/>'s leadership.

Please, let me know what you think.

Thanks for the update.  It is disappointing that AGA is not opening the process, although the final EISB Retail Gas standards will need to be vetted by an ANSI group so we'll get our comments in one way or the other.

think trade reluctant to sell here until they see aga on wednesday and knowing that tropical activity will develop at some point.  however, think the failure from 335 last thursday will weigh on people.  think that nobody wants to own above 325, only as very short term trade to sell to someone else 5-10 cents higher unless aga is very bullish.

All,

We are still working on all the details of the proposed interconnect with Questar Southern Trails in the Blanco Hub and will send you a copy soon for your review.  Since the interconnect is fully reimbursable, Questar is proposing to pay us according to the attached payment schedule vs. paying all of it up front.  

Please take a look at this attached schedule and provide me you comments.  If we allow them to pay "along the way" I am interested in making sure it at least matches the timing of our cash outlay of building the interconnect.  The total estimate of $702,000 includes the tax gross up, which may or may not be applicable, so each of these amount may be reduced by the tax amount.


Does anyone have any concerns with the timing of the payment schedule?  

Thanks, <NAME/>.

I'd say we want tariff language before any investigation.  I don't typically like investigations.  I like complaints.  My thought is to pre-sell tariff changes to FERC with a broad coalition and then get the Ohio PUC to ask FERC the question.

<NAME/>:  I need to verify that the EOL amendment changes conform to the general financial power template changes.

(1)  The EOL amendment provides that the rounding convention for calculating power Floating Prices relating to MMBtus is rounding to four places; the current financial power template provides for rounding to three decimal places.  Which is the correct convention?

(2)  With respect to corrections to published prices, changes will be required to both the ISDA and GTC formats since the latest EOL amendment does not conform to standard ISDA terminology.  There is no corresponding GTC terminology.

Please let me know about (1) above.  Thanks.  <NAME/>

Interesting.  Seems to me that EPSA needs to help AZ do better by its citizens - it's not just APS that's a "bunch of neanderthals" (to use a <NAME/> Shapiro phrase).

In case you hadn't seen it, your pal Vikram's taking some pretty hard knocks right about now.  <NAME/> all is well.
Best,
<NAME/>
Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General <NAME/> Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 
The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies
We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said <NAME/> Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, <NAME/> Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by <NAME/> during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the <NAME/> contract was signed. 
"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the <NAME/> contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." 
The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. 
The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San <NAME/> Chronicle reported Monday. 
The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. 
CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance <NAME/> LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp. (CPN <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=CPN>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=CPN>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=CPN>), according to the report. 
Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.

I have asked and will let you know the answer later today.    The bigger question is that they can not loan money to <NAME/> and can only dividend, so if they can do something to raise the cash, they still can't get it out any more out than they can by dividending.    The other problem is that they are running into cash problems themselves since they were in the process of going to the bond markets when all of this occurred, and were advised to wait.   Their receivables from California are part of the problem.   More update later.

Grigs,

I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will "water out" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In <NAME/>'s opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. <NAME/> this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.

	ENA Upstream Company LLC
`	EPMI

We have consciously excluded EES and the London entities or US entities trading through EEFT in London (such as ECTRIC).

Since <NAME/> Global Markets (and presumably EIM next) is under a mandate for liquidation, don't we need to liase with <NAME/> (for his US products) and London (for products such as weather) which are EGM products?  Since ENA includes FX/rate, we have included that global product in our original review.  This is needed to understand the process of liquidation of the FX/rate book (as netted against other ENA outstanding positions). 

Or is our focus still only gas and power? I just don't want to miss anything or slow down the process.

Probing the 'palace coup' 
Electricity: A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president. 
September 26, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. 
The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa <NAME/>, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup." 
Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. 
The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. 
Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray <NAME/> when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. 
"I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn. 
The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. 
<NAME/> spokesman <NAME/> Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter. 
"The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said. 
Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman <NAME/> Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. 
"It was an emergency," Fishman said. 
"We had to take action.'' 
What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. 
"They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. 
"All hell broke loose.'' 
Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. 
"If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by <NAME/> Energy Vice President <NAME/> Hall III. 
Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. 
In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. 
The generators got their way. 
The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. 
Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. 
They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. 
What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. 
Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. 
Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, <NAME/> Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. 
"In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. 
With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. 
"The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. "It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business." 
Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. 
Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. 
Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. 
Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. 
"We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. "In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund." 
Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. 
"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. 
"He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing." 
The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. 
<NAME/> J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. 
"They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. 
"They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do." 
What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. 
"We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said. "Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''

Thanks for sending this to me, it looks good.  Does Mr. Frevert have the other points just in case further explanation is needed ?  I would not include them in his speaking points what you have is sufficient, but he probably needs the back ground just in case.

Let me know if I can do anything to help.

Hi, <NAME/>:

We have received the draft ISDA Master Agreement back from Nemak, S.A. which they have executed.  It appears to be in order, so I am in the process of preparing it for execution by us.  The effective date on the agreement is July 30, 2001.  We can confirm transactions with them under this Master Agreement.  Once ENA has executed the document, I will send the general e-mail to everyone as usual.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

A couple of points --

1.	The language in the relief indicates that we are trying to "determine the validity and amount of PX Credits owed to EES and EEMC".  Is this correct?  Isn't our primary goal in this complaint to (a) have the Utility return the net credit to our bills and (b) to allow for recoupment againts all non-generation related charges?

2.	Throughout the document the idea of "T&D charges" is used.  I assume that this is shorthand for all non-generation related charges?  We pay CTC and public purpose costs as well as T&D.

3.	Not sure if CPUC regulates the ESPs.  The filing makes this case in the first paragraph.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

Thanks for the thoughts.  We are getting through it.

Cameron actually wore his yellow rain slicker, his yellow rain shoes, and his red fireman's hat.  So, instead of rain boy, he was a fireman.  I must admit that he looked absolutely adorable!!

Your bash sounds like it was a lot of fun.  I wish I could get <NAME/> to dress up, but he really isn't into that type of thing.  We went to the opera Sat. night -- Tanenhouser.  Wagner really is uptight, isn't he?  Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit -- escaped into the music.  I went to a gala last week for MD <NAME/> Cancer Center.  It was amazing.  <NAME/> Lunden MC'd.  The <NAME/> Symphony provided music.  Video from <NAME/> W. Bush.  Speech by GHW Bush.  Entertainment by one of the Irish Tenors, <NAME/> Lovett, Dhianne Carroll (who had a costume change even though she sang only for 20 minutes!), a 300-person chior, all accompanied by the <NAME/> Symphony.  It was quite the event.  Persons there included the former President Bush and <NAME/>, <NAME/> Baker, <NAME/> Simpson, lots of local celebs, and me and my brother  (one of these things is not like the other!).  Still, we had a great time.  So, not all gloom and doom around here.

Well, I'd better get back to it.

FYI, I talked this morning with a guy who took the Mexico cruise the week of Thanksgiving last year.  He gave me some scoop on the trip.  The weather is nice, but wind causes things to be chilly.  Lots of good food.

One thing -- the cruise ship apparently can be quite rocky and rolly, which can cause some folks to have horrible nausea.  You may want to call your pediatrician to get some meds for the kids (and probably call your doc for some meds for you--as I recall, you got awfully seasick on the deep sea fishing boat, although it was when you were having all that trouble with your thyroid).

Texaco has short paid us by 1.5 million for Socal cuts.  I believe that they claimed a penalty on the net out for the amount.  We do not agree with this short pay and stand by the description of the Socal product in which it states that there will be cuts due to operational constraints on the upstream pipelines.  I would like to return the short pay favor to Texaco.  Please let me know how we should proceed.

T
he first detailed allegations that <NAME/>
abused mark-to-market accounting to
hide wholesale trading losses have
emerged in congressional testimony pro-vided
by a professor and former deriva-tives
trader who reviewed the <NAME/> case
for Senate Governmental Affairs Com-mittee.
Those charges, along with allega-tions
that have surfaced that mark-to-market
accounting was misused by <NAME/>
Energy Services, the company's retail
energy and services unit, are expected to
support the push by accounting rulemak-ers
for much more disclosure on mark-to-market
accounting practices and the
impact of mark-to-market accounting on
earnings trading firms' earnings.
In testimony Thursday before the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
last week, <NAME/> Partnoy of the Universi-ty
of San <NAME/> Law School, said it
appears that <NAME/> traders mismarked
forward curves and manipulated the
amount of profits and losses that would
be reported in financial statements.
"In a nutshell, it appears that some
<NAME/> employees used dummy accounts
and rigged valuation methodologies to cre-ate
false profit-and-loss entries for the deriv-atives
<NAME/> traded," said Partnoy, who
reviewed the case over several weeks at the
committee's request. "It appears that <NAME/>
traders selectively mismarked their forward
curves, typically in order to hide losses."
"Traders are compensated based on
their profits," he observed, "so if a trader
can hide losses by mismarking forward
curves, he or she is likely to receive a
larger bonus."
Partnoy said mismarking forward
curves was not the only problem.
"For each trade," he testified, "a
trader would report either a profit or loss,
typically in spreadsheet format. These
profit-and-loss reports were designed to
reflect economic reality. Frequently they
did not. Instead of recording the entire
profit for a trade in one column, some
traders reportedly split the profit from a
trade into two columns. The first column
reflected the portion of the actual profits
the trader intended to add to <NAME/>'s cur-rent
financial statements. The second col-umn,
ironically labeled the 'prudency'
reserve, included the remainder."
Partnoy told the committee that in
his estimation, "<NAME/>'s 'prudency'
reserves did not depict economic reality,
nor could they have been intended to do
so. Instead, 'prudency' was a slush fund
that could be used to smooth out profits
and losses over time. The portion of prof-its
recorded as 'prudency' could be used
to offset any future losses," he said.
He recommended that investigators
question <NAME/> employees who were
involved in these transactions "to get a sense
of whether my summaries are complete."

I got the check and will cash it on Wednesday when I get back to Canada.  Things down here are not going quite as well as I had planned.  I've been doing a bad job of trading and there is no fundamentals to work off of, nor does anyone want to develop any!  <NAME/> Storey's (who trades Eastern Canada and Chicago) father was in the World Trade Center for a 2 hour meeting on the 101 Floor of the first building that was hit, he is missing and presumed dead.  A funeral is being held for him this Saturday and I think this has caused people around here to take it even more personally.  I have to admit, for the first time in years I'm a little nervous about flying back to Calgary on Wednesday.

Glad to hear school is going well, I kind of wished I was there with you.  Best of luck, and I'll email you when I get back from Calgary.

Regards,

Mo,

Hey, glad to know you are recovering swiftly from Friday nights festivities.  I think I just might have finally kicked my hangover.  Joe said he woke up early Saturday morning to find me passed out in my clothes face down on the couch with the cat snuggling up against me.  As exhausted as I was, I had to meet keith at the office Sat. and then went to a party Sat night where some asshole at the party backed into my car and didn't even come in and tell me!  Now I have to play detective to find out who did it.  Anyway, I had a great time hanging out Friday night and I'm glad you did too.  <NAME/> to see you around soon.  Give me a call if you're going to be around anytime.

<NAME/>,
The house we live in is about 1700 Sq foot.. older home that needed some fixing up.  At the time I thought we paid too much, however prices in the neighborhood skyrocketed just after we bought the home.  The <NAME/> Texans (a very original name) have developed the new stadium and have torn down some of the seedier hotels in the area in their wake.  Also, they have totally redone South Main Blvd creating a nice thoroughfare. The area is experincing a lot of renovation which is adding value to the neighborhood!  However, home values go up and down just like the stock market.  Most important thing is that we like the home and are very comfortable there.

When we had the house remodeled it was a nightmare, I think the guy was an alcoholic and he did a half ass job.  I prefer to do it myself, I like the way it looks when I do it and it is whole lot cheaper.  One day the contractor almost died in the house... he lost his tooth and proceeded to take a bunch of Advil to ease the pain; however he did this on an empty stomach.  He had to be rushed to the hospital and was there for a week!  He ended up returning and finishing the job?!?!  Anyways, I have to say that it was a good learning experience and next time I will have a better idea on how to get things done.  It was hard to organize and quality assure the job since I had just started a demanding job here at <NAME/>.  All in all, I think France or US you run into the same types of problems with contractors.  

Talking about wild flowers and plants.. the same is true for Costa Rica.   Plants that only grow indoors with great care in <NAME/> grow like weeds in Costa Rica.  I recommend that on your places to go list.

<NAME/> budget focus for today beginning in a few minutes is to have our act together for the Delainey/Dietrich EES review tomorrow - <NAME/> Dayao, <NAME/> Apollo and Kerry Roper will join me for a walk through. 

Finalizing EIM budget will likely not get done today.  Can give you the details on why later today.  <NAME/> become obvious.

Just meet with Shankman and McConnell.  Not ready to finalize EGM budget yet.  They say that their commercial guys are waiting for <NAME/> Johnson to get with them on details of IT development projects.  I think that <NAME/> has been out for a few days, but I did see him on the 3rd floor when I was down there with Shankman and McConnell.  I will leave him a voice mail message to get an update on outstanding issues from his point of view.  <NAME/> and <NAME/> want to have their stuff finalized by Friday.  I will convey that timeline to <NAME/> Johnson.

After EES budget prep meeting this afternoon, next tall order of business is expanding our receivables monetization beyond EA to other commodities.  High priorty and very short time fuse on this one, for reasons that should be obvious.  I will have all of the Operations leads and settlements leads together this afternoon, along with Ramesh Rao and others in IT who may be required to help us extract necessary info. 

Nice way of telling you, <NAME/>, that I understand your desire for a page of footnotes with budget explanations for Whalley, and that in my opinion that falls at the end of the list behind some of these other things today.  I will work with Kerry on this.  I can tell you, however, that updates on budgets are not top on anyone's lists today, including Whalley's.  We will honor your commitment to get him updated information, and will provide as much detail as possible.  Best approach given the state of business today may be to provide him with the high level overview (that one page of expense and capital), state where we are in the review process with each business unit, and highlight reductions in expense and capital to date.   We can continue to provide updates to Whalley as the EES, EIM, EGM and EBS (yes, I need to coordinate with <NAME/> P. when he is back on some changes here - confidential at this point).  <NAME/>'t know how useful detailed footnotes will be for Whalley before we truly finalize the various business unit budgets.  --<NAME/>

<NAME/>:

Attached are the following:

1.	ConEd's form of Schedule and Paragraph 13 and

2.	Our comparison of the above documents.

Please review the following credit related items and let me know if you are okay with ConEd's language or if you would prefer our revision:

1.	Part 1(c) - "Cross Default" - ConEd has left in the provision re cross acceleration, which we usually take out, but leave in if our counterparty is a financial institution.

2.	Part 1(d) - "Credit Event Upon Merger" - will you agree to ConEd's language?

Also, I know you said that we were just going to comment on ConEd's version without credit, but <NAME/> wanted to know if you want to include cross-default thresholds and the same matrix we are using in the two specific transactions.

Please let me have your response to the above as soon as possible so that we can send our comments to ConEd, as they are getting pretty agitated that we are taking so long.

Thanks!

<NAME/>:
 
I got the e-mail last night with the tabs for the breakdown of the current 184 for Operations, inclusive of Power and Gas Logistics.  (The tabs total 184 with one Associate noted on a separate line in Power Logistics, and 183 without that Associate, so I don't know whether you are using 183 or 184 currently for the Operations total.) Taking this number to 100 in total is obviously a big change - 45.6% reduction.  At this moment, I don't know how feasible that is.  But I will work with <NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/> to find out.
 
We  need some questions answered first to go through this:
 
1)  Who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for Gas and Power Logistics?  Together, those groups represent 25% of the 184 headcount.  Going in, I would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions - should be 21 reductions.  We need to know who we should work with to coordinate this.  Need names and weekend contact numbers.
 
2)  What will the overall headcount be for Netco?  What we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes.  If commercial numbers don't change and the business scope doesn't change, a 45.6% reduction is probably out of the question.  
 
3)  Is the 100 number for Operations only a start-up number?  Could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up, approval is obtained for physical gas business, etc.?  Or is the 100 number intended to be the total headcount for all of 2002?
 
4)  What are UBS' expectations for mid and back office?  What are the views from Legal and UBS on creating confirmations for EOL transactions?  There were some discussions with <NAME/> Reeves about not confirming certain types of transactions.  One firm, and I don't remember whether it was UBS or not, mentioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions, and that instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations.  That is a completely different activity than we normally engage in, and would make a difference in staffing - perhaps requiring more people!   We need to know those things from UBS to take a real stab at a revised number.  Should we just pool our knowledge from various discussions that have been had with UBS, or is there someone with UBS that we should be talking with this weekend to get there view of what is required?
 
5)  Does the internal RAC group go forward under a headcount reduction - i.e. will we be coordinating and providing information to them, or will UBS assume some of their functions?  This may impact our staffing needs.  What about consolidated risk reporting - will <NAME/> and <NAME/> simply transmit data to UBS, or Netco have to provide some consolidated risk reporting before sending info to UBS?
 
We may have more questions, but these are key now to get at a feasible number.

<NAME/>,

I'm not sure if we met either time at the <NAME/> airport this summer.  My husband and I hosted 4-year old <NAME/>, part of the same Taraz group as your child.   We miss her terribly and are counting the days until we can bring her home.  We're certainly not looking forward to travel at this time, and even less happy about leaving our 6-year old son home while we are out of country, but we are resolved to bring <NAME/> home -- the sooner, the better.

Based on conversations with <NAME/> and <NAME/>, it sounds like we may face the travel adventure at the same time -- although I'm not sure when.

We have completed our dossier (although I haven't sent the originals to <NAME/>); completed our home study & sent into INS recently; and we've already done the INS fingerprinting.  So I guess the next steps are INS approval, shipping stuff off to Kazakstan, and getting our Kazakstan visas.

One of the hardest parts of the Kidsave program is not being able to communicate with the kids when they return.  She is in the Ulan orphanage in Taraz.  <NAME/> speaks only Kazak, no Russian, so I'm not sure how I'd communicate with her long distance even if I had an address or phone number.  Fortunately I have received periodic emails from <NAME/>, the escort that came to <NAME/> with the children this summer.  Her husband, Sergei, has been to visit the children in Taraz & she sent me a picture of <NAME/>.

Sorry to ramble so.  I'm anxious to talk to you about your child, your travel plans, possibilities for hiring an escort, etc.  Please feel free to call or email me anytime.  Here is my contact info.

FYI......

We are not bringing in prompt month value tonight.  Texas did, about $25,000.  The other regions don't have what we need for demand charges, etc. and no one has taken any time to research the values yet.  The other groups we need have been gone for hours.  We have some large positions which I don't really think are right.  I'll look closer in the morning.  

<NAME/> you feel better soon, at least you have all weekend to recover.

<NAME/> and <NAME/>--
	Following up on our meeting today, I need to know what my negotiation parameters are regarding the fuel charge for our Sun Devil Project.  How much (if any) can I discount the fuel charges for Sun Devil shippers, based on the following assumptions, 

Project cost $911mm
Include all compression adds/mods from <NAME/> Cebryk engineering scope dated 9/28/01
Incremental Volume MMBtu/d: 780,000 San <NAME/>, 810,000 Mainline, 500,000 to Phoenix, 310,000 to Cal Border
Of 1,520,000 total capacity to Cal Border and 500,000 to Phoenix, assume 390,000 has to come from East of Thoreau
Assume load factors in 10% increments from 50% west flow up to 100%.
Assume fuel collection of 5% from shippers

In theory, we all agreed in the meeting that with the additional loop line installed for Sun Devil, and the new compressors at stations 1-4 are more efficient, then the actual fuel use should be less.  Please verify this for the load factors above.  If we can keep the same net fuel retainage, but collect less because our actual fuel use is less, then this is a win-win for both TW and the Sun Devil shippers.

Is an answer possible by Tuesday 11/13?

thanks

<NAME/>,

A short summary of the proposed modes of cooperation with Prediction Company.

I. Projects (in the order they suggested it).

	1. Prediction Company develops a P&L attribution system (allocation of P&L to different market
	factors, like spreads, volume, trader's skills, etc.). Trader's performance evaluation system.

	2. Decision support system: a model recommending transactions to a trader without
	full trade automation.

	3. Fully automated trading system, setting prices and executing trades on an electronic trading platform.
 
II. Financial arrangements. Combination of a number of different forms of equity participation, direct payments 
   per project on completion, and   fees per transaction.

	1. Equity investment would reduce fees and payments. For Prediction Company, this is a preferred form of 
	    <NAME/>'s participation.

	2. Payment per project would look like consulting fees.

	3. Next to equity investment, they would like to see a constant income stream through
	    fees charged per transaction. My comment: in case they design a decision support
	    tool, it will be difficult to come up with a per transaction fee. It will be difficult to identify
	    decisions that can be attributed exclusively to their system.


Recommendations:

	1. A visit to Santa Fe with <NAME/> <NAME/> to discuss an equity investment.

	2. I shall try to dig up more information about the company and the relationship
                with UBS.

	3. We should  come up with a solution that will help to transfer skills to <NAME/> from
	    Prediction Company.

Since I'm thinking of it, what we'd like to strive for is, for one, to be able to double click on the bars and get a list of the the plant outages that make up the total and also to be able to select date ranges.  Also, it would be be great to be able to be able to select daily or monthly averages over a day range or month range, respectively.

Not so impressed with <NAME/> goldman.  For a guy who has worked in derivatives for 10 years, couldnt answer some simple questions.  Very poor financial derivatives knowledge even though he worked at CRT for a long time and a Lyonnais for a while.

Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that <NAME/> is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur"

ICAP exposure needs to be capped at the default price (currently 8.75/kW/mo).   Because Zone J is deficient capacity, the market is actually trading higher than the default rate.

In addition, we need to scrub the ancillary components.

<NAME/>,  The agreement calls for them to provide to ENA certification that they have set aside special funds to meet their payment obligations to ENA under this agreement.  A letter from the mayor or city manager indicating such budget approvals are sufficient.  To the extent they don't provide this, an Early Termination event occurs.  We can still call for collateral in accordance with Section 4.5 if they don't meet the thresholds.  The item added in your Sentence #1 below does concern me.  This seems to be a floated revenue system and I am not sure how we get comfortable that the revenues will be there.  I need to review these additions with Colorado Springs, because it is not clear to me how they think such provisions operate in the context of the existing language concerning the budget certification requirements.  We probably need to get on a conference call with them.
 
I am probably OK with the arbitration provision, depending on how the other items turn out.
 
<NAME/>,  do you want to set something up a call with <NAME/> and his attorney to discuss these issues?

While we are not yet enamored with any policy option, we are committed to helping FERC do whatever is necessary to create a strong and well functioning marketplace.

As soon as I have any more, I'll let you know.  <NAME/> Novosel and I are intending to come to the meeting.

Hi, <NAME/>:

ECT Investments, Inc. is trying to finalize a "Terms of Business Letter" with Goldman Sachs International ("GSI") in London (for trading foreign listed equity options).  GSI is resisting the inclusion of any limitation of liability language in the agreement.  Our agreement is governed by English law.  I have requested the following simple statement:

	"Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss of damage."

Do you even use such a provision in your documents goverened under English law?  What language (if any) would you propose for use with an English party?

I'd appreciate your insight.

Regards,
<NAME/>

I'm thinking that we may miss church altogether on Sunday.  We may spend the night at my inlaws in Conroe.  They have been bugging us to visit and I don't see another date on the calendar that will work.  Nov 3 for example, there is no children's church, but I am open/close trustee.  <NAME/>'t worry about the CD player -- it's no problem.  I don't mind exchanging it until we get a CD player and duplicate copies of music (which I'm working on).
 
We received our INS approval to adopt <NAME/>, but with court date delays etc., it looks like our most likely travel time is late November or early December.  When I get a little better info.  I will make Children's Church plans.  If it turns out that I'm gone several weeks in December, then perhaps we can talk <NAME/> into letting the kids sit in regular church during Advent.  It is always such a fun time for them to be in church & they recognize so many of the songs.  If I'm only going to be gone in late Dec & first week of Dec, then we can probably continue with Children's church as planned.  I'm really just guessing now -- since this international adoption stuff changes by the minute.

Happy Holidays!  

 

 

Dear Tech Support,

Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a
slowdown in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had
operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0
uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9,and installed
undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0.

Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes
the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to
no avail. What can I do?

<NAME/>

> >---------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Desperate,

First, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package,
while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Install Tears 6.2 and enter the
command <C:\ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>.

Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and
Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to
Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad
program that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files.

DO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend
program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.

In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a
limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider
buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend
Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9.

Good luck.

LADWP, Run By <NAME/> Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones


   By <NAME/> Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray <NAME/> has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the <NAME/> administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager <NAME/> <NAME/>, who in April became
<NAME/>' top energy adviser.

  <NAME/> Maviglio, press secretary to <NAME/>, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind," he said. "The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators."

  <NAME/>'s trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig could
make money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  <NAME/> took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  "It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," <NAME/> said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
<NAME/>
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

<NAME/>,

Due to the fact <NAME/> killed several transactions (as opposed to zeroing them out in Scheduling), the real-time position manager is out of balance for December 2 and December 3 at the Mid-C and COB.  December 1 looks OK.  This seems like an issue that <NAME/> is going to have to resolve since they know the deals that were killed.  I will put the necessary interdesk swaps in on Saturday, but I'm going to leave Sunday and Monday open at this point.  If you have any questions, let me or <NAME/> know.

We are making final changes to the orig presentation today - I will be reviewing those tomorrow in <NAME/>.

happy new year.  i can't remember when you were taking your trip to france, but i hope things are going well.  i'm back in town now after a long and peaceful break - mainly just waiting to see what happens to the enron trading operations.  

where did you buy the hardware when you built your servers?  i'm thinking of building a database server and am not sure if its best to mail order or buy in person somewhere in town.  

hope you're well and talk to you soon,

Dear Gaylen and <NAME/>,

Attached, please find the Questar Southern Trails Interconnect Agreement and drawing of its location in the San <NAME/> area.  The estimated cost of the interconnect is $702,000.  This cost estimate is what we call a "Level A" which means it is + or - 30%.  Once we execute the agreement, we will perform a "Level B" which will narrow the cost range. 

Please review and let me know if you have any questions or comments.  

Thanks, 

<NAME/>.


      

P.S.   I'm having trouble attaching the drawing.  I will send it under separate cover.

I can't imagine that I'll need to layoff more than 6 or 7 people in the near future.  None of the pipes have filed Ch.11 and there are no plans to do so.

Greetings Ms Denne:
<NAME/> your holiday was restful and relaxing.  A week or so ago, there was an article in the clips about <NAME/> partnering with a muni (in Canada maybe) to provide retail energy services for the munis retail customers.  Could someone in your shop try to dig that up?  I need to get it to a CEO of a California muni for EES and I'll be darned if I can't locate it!  Greatly appreciated.

Not until all of the key electricity fixes are included in the package - remember RTOs are still voluntary, the Courts have yet to require FERC to do away with the Native Load exception, and NERC is in charge of reliability.  This is clearly the biggest issue for the Publics.

The past two years, <NAME/> has offered a very effective two-day session called Executive Influence and Impact.  This is required of everyone at the VP level and above, and participation is definitely tracked.  I thought that the class was very helpful.  360 feedback is solicited prior to the session and is used in a very constructive and focused way to help each participant target two to three areas in which specific actions will be targeted to improve on the participant's leadership in communicating with and motivating employees.  

<NAME/> will now offer this course tailored for Directors and Senior Directors.   I would like to have all directors and senior directors in our organization take advantage of this opportunity.  Unfortunately, I didn't find out about this opportunity early enough to work with everyone to plot out a schedule in advance for all directors and senior directors.  I want to work with the entire management team to create that plan, as sessions will be offered in May, September, November and February (2002).  

However, today is the deadline for registering participants for the first session, May 16 and 17.  This will be given in <NAME/>.  I would like to have several participants from our team in this first session.  My suggestion would be that <NAME/> Herod and <NAME/> Scribner attend as senior directors and that we also extend this opportunity to Shona <NAME/> and Thresa <NAME/> as directors.  I have asked <NAME/> to secure four spots for us, using these names as participants.  If this timing does not work, please let me know and we can determine who could be substituted for the May session.  We would have to name a sub right away, so please get back with me ASAP and confirm that the four names that I have suggested will be able to attend, or let me know your recommendation on a substitution.  
Thanks.

San <NAME/>, Oct. 18, 2001 (Forestweb) - Weyerhaeuser Co. will increase the U.S. price of its northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) price by $20/tonne to $500/tonne effective Nov. 1, according to a buyer source. Another buyer source said Weyerhaeuser has increased his price by $20/tonne on the sawdust pulp that he buys, "and I assume on the others." Weyerhaeuser officials were not available for comment. Weyerhaeuser has been the lone holdout at the U.S. price of $480/tonne for Oct. 1, when other North American producers went to $500/tonne. The competitors have complained that Weyerhaeuser's price was a drag on their efforts. Producers and buyers alike have said that $500/tonne has been a hard sell in October, partly because of the market, but also because demand has been so slow. A number of sources say NBSK is at $480/tonne for October, though a few are paying the $500/tonne price. "I don't think we will pay $500 (in November)," a buyer said today. "I think it will be $490." An agent today described the Weyerhaeuser news as "a plus," but added, "Now all we need is for demand to pick up." Another agent also responded cautiously. "There is no indication anywhere in the world where demand has picked up, certainly not in the paper business. Without that, (producers) can announce what they want to, but it is not a slam dunk," he said. As for October transaction , aid that in most cases, they didn't move. "I know everyone needs (price increases) and I know the inventories have gone down, but my feeling is they will go up again," he said, noting typical late-fall patterns.  said that in contrast to the past, paper companies have not been able to make money off of low prices. "It's going to be a battle, for sure," he said. "There's a lot of fighting going on, a lot (of buyers) are saying they're not going to pay it."

Eddie,

We'll need a new pipeline for Northwest manual entry.  The point should have DRN JPINV, but no corresponding IHS DRN.  Please populate the database with a value of 16,460,301 with flow type S for 6/2/2001.  We will manually enter this point until we can automate it.

As you know, we have a new book runner for the west.  I have asked Kam Keiser to go ahead and set up two new books for you guys.  <NAME/>'s book will be IM WC Socal, and <NAME/>'s will be IM WC Nocal.  These books will be ready for when we move into the new building.  I will transfer any positions that I have to you guys at gas daily mid.  You will make the markets for your own books.  We will address having you guys take the gas dailies in the near future.

Congratulations!

The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort <NAME/> project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by <NAME/> Fairley, <NAME/> McMichael, <NAME/> Concannon, <NAME/> Breese, <NAME/> Boyt, and <NAME/> <NAME/>.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)

1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  <NAME/>'s 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. <NAME/>'s 82MW.

2)  <NAME/> will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our "bought-down" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:



   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By <NAME/>	Ft. <NAME/> Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	Capacity From East Desk	
May	22,300	0	22,300	0	
June	22,300	0	22,300	0	
July	22,300	0	22,300	0	
August	22,300	0	22,300	0	
September	22,300	0	22,300	0	


  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

3)  Ft. <NAME/> will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.

4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. <NAME/> is not dispatched, thus leaving <NAME/> with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)

5)  Because Ft. <NAME/> will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for <NAME/>.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.

6) <NAME/> will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. <NAME/> via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:




	

   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By <NAME/>	Ft. <NAME/> Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of <NAME/>)	Capacity From East Desk	
October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0	
November	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412	
December	35,251	14,895	6,244	14,112	
January	35,251	16,547	6,244	12,460	
February	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	
March	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	
April	35,251	15,317	22,300	0	


NOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each dispatch mode is attached to this memo.

Hi Mom,

I am still here, there is so little work that pretty much all I do is talk to people, play computer games and read e-mail.  I still can't believe that this has all happened.  

<NAME/> is doing better, he is calmer now and less upset. I am glad to see that, I felt really bad for how upset he was.
He is going to go stay with his folks for a few days, they had their insurance company call and tell them that if they didn't clean up the outside of the house that they would drop them from insurance. They had a gardener come out, but <NAME/> is going to take the pressure washer down and wash the house. I personally think they need to move to a retirement apartment with some living assistance. They do not seem to have the ability to take care of anything anymore.

Work is winding down, folks are bored and working on resumes and stuff.  

I love you,

<NAME/>

If you really think you'll need to get in touch while I'm overseas you can try my international cell phone #  44-7881-512-535 which is a London phone number but works throughout Europe and North America.  And of course when all else fails you can always try to page me at (877)855-2081 or send an e-mail to my pager at 8778552081@pagenetmessage.net.  But the bottom line is that there is a large percentage of the time that I'm just plain unreachable since I turn them all off and let the machines do the answering -- which may not impress Joe but in my book is even more impressive than having lots of numbers.

We have many deals in the system with UI, but they are all part of one contract.  To my knowledge, this is the only big contract we have with them.  Just wanted to let you know because going through all the deals would be time consuming and they basically are one huge deal.

<NAME/>- J Block was just a gas contract. At <NAME/>, risk is controlled through one of two mechanisms: a book structure with approved limits and daily reporting of P&L or through a one off approval of a Dash. No risk should be taken on outside of these boundaries. Even though there is no capital, a gas contract contains market and credit risk and should be approved, providing it doesn't fit into a book. <NAME/>

<NAME/>, I need a confidentiality agrmt for a proposed pipe sale transaction.

We are evaluating possibly selling a lateral piece of TW pipe to Pioneer.  They are interested in purchasing approx. 35 miles of pipe that TW took out of service in 2000.  The pipe in located in <NAME/> and Pecos County, Texas.  

Once the C.A. is executed, we would let Pioneer begin due diligence covering information such as easements, maintenance records, physical location, etc.

Pioneer is an owner/operator of gas gathering & intrastate pipe transmission assets.  Their info is as follows:

Pioneer Gas Pipeline, Inc.

Here are some questions/comments I have regarding the ruling.

1.  How does the cap apply to index prices.  If the DJ-PV index settles at $120 and the cap is $98, do parties selling index have to adjust there price to $98?

2.  Would financial products (swaps) be affected by the cap?

3.  There has to be less ambiguity with respect to day ahead cash markets.  For example, assume it's a Monday and the ISO is under normal conditions and the price is $92.  Then assume on HE 14 the ISO declares a stage one and the price clears at $100 and the price is $100 for the rest of the day.  Tuesday assume the price is $85 during the first few offpeak hours, but the Wednesday forecast shows identical conditions as Monday.  What is the day ahead cash cap trading Tuesday for Wednesday?
Is it $85 or $100?  One could make the argument that it should be $100 because it is reasonable to assume they will be in a stage one real time on Wednesday, but at the time cash is traded they are not in a stage one.

It seems to me the easiest way to solve this problem would be to have an independent market organization declare what the day ahead cash market price was before the cash market traded.  So for the example, they may recognize it's likely a stage 1 $100 cap will be in effect on Wednesday, so they'll set the cap at $100.  The market will know before hand and there will be no ambiguity.  More efficient market, less litigation.

4.  What about call options?  If a generator owns a call option at $125, the cap is $100, but the market is actually trading $150, does the generator have the right to exercise the option?  What if the generator has a plant that he can fire up at $150.  Does the generator have to wait until the price hits $150?  Seems like the strike price on an option would be an easily demonstrable expense.  And would there be a difference between a marketer owning an option and a generator owning an option?

<NAME/>,

I submitted my evaluation. General impression was rather
negative: he seems to be a consultant type person
who speaks about everything with confidence  but is short on depth
and technical details.

He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive
side.

Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after
18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.

<NAME/>,

Here is a brief personal work history.  I've been in the utility industry pretty much since 1988.  I started trading for Portland General Electric in 1995.  I've been a trader for <NAME/> for the last 4 years.  I run <NAME/>'s short-term Northwest book.  I have market-making responsibility for the cash, balance, and prompt months for the Mid-Columbia and COB specifically, although I am responsible for the entire Northwest.  I also trade Palo Verde, SP15, and NP15.

I have recently talked with a couple of other trading outfits out west and generally the structure looks something like this:

1.  150 K Base Salary
2.  250 to 300 K Signing Bonus
3.  Various bonus structures, generally with a minimum guaranteed equal to the base salary.

Quite frankly a move to the east coast is not very appealing.  The compensation package would have to be very attractive for me to seriously consider a move to that area.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

I was about to send off the info from the prior email when I received your latest update.  However, I'm confused by the update.  The form seems to be the same, except it is intended to be sent to the Republic of Kazakhstan in New York.  Is that really where we are sending our registration information?  What about the autobiography.  What is that, What is required?  

I understand the urgency in registering and am prepared to do what it takes to accomplish this today.  But, frankly this whole process was a surprise to me.  Does your agency have an written materials on follow-up requirements/processes in general.  I'm sort of at a loss on the whole issue of what comes next.  When to apply for SS#.  What about readoption.  Passport, Certificate of Citizenship, etc.  I was surprised when a resident alien card arrived.

I need to take care of the registration issue today, as we will be on vacation starting tomorrow for a week.

FYI.  The statements about Transco not honoring EOL contracts doesn't make sense to me.  I don't understand if they are saying that they are cutting supply or not honoring transportation nominations.

The spinmisters are already at work.  People at FERC thought we had bought into the "new NERC" <NAME/> DOES NOT SUPPORT NERC in working through commercial issues.  We need to develop our opinions of where to go next, but right now you can respond to <NAME/> Nevius that we still don't believe that NERC and its process/organziation is the right vehicle.  We are willing to find a way to do this, but we can't have the same SRO bullshit that they have been saying for 3 years.

Sorry I missed the call.  I'll talk with you guys Friday.

Note also that in a separate development FERC
simultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section
206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new
market-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide.
What this means is that, although only three utilities are
mentioned in this initial order, it is expected that FERC
will continue to take steps to constrain what it believes
to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30
companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to
determine if the commission believes they exert market
power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires
power providers with market-based sales authority to amend
their tariffs within 60 days to provide FERC with
open-ended authority to order refunds if the commission
determines that market manipulation has occurred.

Hi <NAME/> and <NAME/>,

I am not certain that <NAME/> has been made aware of where and which spaces have been allocated to her (<NAME/> Gadd's group) with respect to the move.  In effort to make sure that no one falls through the crack, would you please coordinate with <NAME/> as to which floor and specifically which cubical/office locations she can slot her people in.  <NAME/> will also coordinate <NAME/> Dowd with the rest of <NAME/>'s group in the move so we need to keep a space for him.  

<NAME/>,

Please let me know when you have accounted for everyone in <NAME/>'s group (plus <NAME/> Dowd) for the move and have the location assignment.  


The goal for all is that everyone will have a chair when the music stops.  :>)

Campaign funds will pay for spots 
<NAME/> Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Saturday, July 7, 2001 
?2001 San <NAME/> Chronicle 
Sacramento -- Gov. Gray <NAME/> will begin a series of radio ads next week defending his handling of the energy crisis -- further proof that political campaigning has become a permanent sport. 
<NAME/> political adviser <NAME/> South said the ads are designed to fill an "information void" among Californians about what the state has accomplished. But they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars of TV ads financed by Republicans and power companies are attacking <NAME/>. 
"The campaign season has started early," said <NAME/> Stutzman, a consultant with the state GOP, which has not been involved with the anti-<NAME/> TV spots running since June 19. 
<NAME/>' 60-second radio spot takes the form of an "energy update," where the governor informs listeners that "we" have licensed 16 new power plants, including three <NAME/> opened this month, and that "conservation is the best way to fight back against high energy prices." 
<NAME/>' ads convey the same information as a series of state-financed "Flex Your Power" ads run by the Department of Consumer Affairs, only those ads don't mention <NAME/>. <NAME/>' campaign fund, worth well above $25 million, is paying for the $150,000-per-week radio spots to avoid accusations he is using state money to finance his political ambitions. 
South dismissed the notion that the radio ads came in response to the TV ads that make <NAME/> a target, saying the governor's poll numbers are actually going up. He said people laughed at the ads attacking the governor as ridiculous, particularly one showing <NAME/> in Red Square. 
"One of the reasons we chose this ('energy update') tack," South said, "is that people simply are not in the mood to have some full-out firefight and some partisan battle about this problem. They are in a just-the-facts-ma'am mood." 
Stutzman said he didn't disagree with South about the ill-timed and partisan nature of the TV ads, which are financed out of Washington, D.C., but he said the governor is also launching a political firefight of his own. 
"These ads, even though the the first iteration of them sound like public service ads, very much are political ads," Stutzman said. "The reason they may be poor political ads is they use the governor's voice, and I don't think he has any credibility on this issue." 
<NAME/> already has updated his 2002 campaign Web site, www.gray-davis.com, which includes an odd-looking caricature of the governor and a photo of <NAME/> standing with actor <NAME/> Sheen, who plays a president on the TV show "The West Wing." The Sheen photo dominates the home page. 
"What we're trying to do with the Web site is have a little fun with it," said South, who declined to say whether <NAME/> would run against President Bush in 2004. 
Last month, a conservative group with links to Republicans and energy companies began running a series of ads blaming <NAME/> for the energy crisis and saying the state was suffering from "Grayouts." 
Time magazine reported last month that hundreds of corporations had contributed to the ads attacking <NAME/>, who has accused Texas firms such as Reliant Energy of "unconscionable price-gouging." 
Reliant, which donated $10,000 to <NAME/> before the energy crisis, has contributed to the anti-<NAME/> advertising effort, according to Time, and the American Taxpayers Alliance hopes to raise as much as $25 million to keep the ads running in California through July. 
<NAME/> <NAME/>, a former campaign manager for <NAME/> Dole's failed 1996 presidential bid, formed the American Taxpayers Alliance in Washington to raise money for the 30-second ads. He has refused to name his donors, and did not return a call for comment yesterday. 
Even though the 2002 elections are more than a year away, Republicans are worried they are losing ground in Congress on Bush's energy policy, and <NAME/>' popularity has slipped somewhat in the polls. 
But the ads mounted by both sides also are designed to change public policy. 
<NAME/> recently hired former <NAME/>-Gore campaign and White House strategists <NAME/> Lehane and <NAME/> Fabiani, and <NAME/>' public presence and political pull dramatically increased. 
Another conservative group, the 21st Century Energy Project, will begin running TV ads next week in Washington to promote expansion of the energy supply, more drilling and nuclear energy. 
The $500,000, two-week advertising purchase is being coordinated by <NAME/> Gillespie, a former campaign strategist for Bush and a consultant for <NAME/>'s <NAME/> Corp., the world's largest energy trader. 
Gillespie said yesterday his group wants to promote a "conservative, market- oriented message" about energy, to counteract environmental groups such as the <NAME/> Club. He said environmentalists aren't addressing the gap between supply and demand, except through strict conservation. 
"We're trying to shape the debate, because it's been pretty one-sided so far," Gillespie said.

After reviewing the Doorstep audit at Long Beach with the team I have the following conclusion:

1. We should shut these offices down because we can not control them. They don't make much money and will be a huge negative after losses at Long Beach.

---or----

2. We establish a rigid template for how these offices operate. My thought is that we create a McDonalds Hamburger type operation. Each office is exactly the same and operates under precise and well communicated rules. "Hamburger" quality is monitored from <NAME/> routinely.

There are a huge number of these remote offices so we need to address how we proceed.

Any thoughts? <NAME/>

Dale,

Thanks for the email.  I would be happy to pay the 50.00 fee one last time, however, given that this account will not be touched and no changes in the accounts holdings are allowed under Canadian tax law given my status, we need to find a way to either avoid this fee in the future or transfer the holdings to somewhere else.  I would much appreciate your recommendation on how to proceed as well as an address as to where I should send the money for the outstanding balance.

Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the "core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, "Plan B," <NAME/> MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of the Senate (<NAME/>) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.

PG&E restructuring bid draws state ire 
By Dale Kasler and <NAME/> Peyton
Bee Staff Writers 
(Published Sept. 21, 2001)

In a controversial attempt to dig its way out of bankruptcy, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. proposed a radical restructuring Thursday that would pay off its debts but end state regulation of the utility's valuable hydroelectric and nuclear plants. 
To make the plan work, PG&E asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to override state laws and regulations governing power-plant ownership -- a request that triggered immediate opposition from California officials. 
PG&E said the plan, a complicated blend of asset transfers, debt refinancing and corporate spinoffs, would restore the utility's financial health and creditworthiness without requiring additional rate hikes or a state "bailout." Divorcing the utility from its parent company, the plan would pay off the entire $13.2 billion of debt PG&E accumulated during California's poorly executed era of deregulation. 
The plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San <NAME/>, had the support of a key block of creditors, including independent energy generators, whose approval is necessary to any reorganization plan. 
But it ran into immediate opposition from Gov. Gray <NAME/> and other state officials, setting up a potentially fierce battle. Despite PG&E's claims to the contrary, they warned the plan could trigger more hikes because PG&E could charge nearly double the amount it currently charges for electricity from the hydro and nuclear plants. The proposal would have the state Public Utilities Commission relinquish control over those plants to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
FERC "has proven over the last 18 months to be ... no friend of the ratepayer," <NAME/> told reporters Thursday. "The PUC, while far from perfect, has been a stronger advocate for ratepayers than the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ... I'm very wary of PG&E's proposal to transfer all of its generating capacity from a regulated environment to a non-regulated environment." 
The PUC vowed to fight the plan in court. "I don't think the judge is going to do it," said PUC President <NAME/> Lynch. 
Consumer advocates noted that PG&E has been pushing for years to end state regulation of its hydro plants. "It's complete piracy," said <NAME/> Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network of San <NAME/>. "It's the most audacious thing I've ever seen." 
Filed six months after the utility sought bankruptcy protection, the plan calls for PG&E to be spun off from PG&E Corp., but the utility would transfer its hydro and nuclear plants and some other assets to the parent. 
That would violate a state law, passed as a response to the energy crisis, prohibiting utilities from selling any of their generating plants before 2006. The law was intended to keep electricity in California hands at a time when out-of-state generators were charging ultra-high prices to PG&E and Southern California <NAME/>. 
PG&E acknowledged the conflict with state law but said it will ask the bankruptcy court -- a federal entity -- to override the state law. Legal experts said it's not clear whether a bankruptcy judge would ignore state law, and in prior rulings U.S. Bankruptcy Judge <NAME/> Montali has sided with state officials. 
"Any federal court would be very reluctant to go in and override state laws," said influential state Sen. <NAME/> Bowen, D-<NAME/> del Rey, chair of the Senate Energy Committee. 
<NAME/> D. <NAME/> Jr., PG&E's chairman, called the transfer a good deal for customers. He said the electricity from those plants would be sold back to the utility at about $50 a megawatt hour -- "the lower end" of current rates -- under a 12-year contract. 
But that's almost double the existing rates for those plants, critics said. 
And <NAME/> Cohen, the PUC's general counsel, said the company would be free to charge market rates when the contract runs out, putting utility customers at the mercy of an independent, unregulated generator. 
"This is more of what got us into this mess to begin with," Cohen said. 
Despite the friction between PG&E and the state, the plan requires assurance from the PUC that the utility will be allowed to collect its wholesale power costs in the future from ratepayers, regardless of how high they go. Such assurance will make the utility creditworthy again and able to borrow money to fund the reorganization, PG&E said. 
The plan also requires approval from federal officials and a "yes" vote from a majority of PG&E's creditors, along with Montali. 
<NAME/> said the plan could be completed by December 2002, enabling the utility to resume buying electricity. The state has been buying power for PG&E since January, when it became insolvent. 
While the PUC raised rates an average of 40 percent this year, the reorganization plan doesn't require another rate hike, <NAME/> insisted. "From the customers' view, this transaction will be seamless," he said. The same should be true for most employees, he said. 
The PG&E chairman, whose company has feuded with <NAME/> for months, also boasted that PG&E isn't "asking the state for a bailout or a rescue" -- a jab at <NAME/>' as-yet-unsuccessful effort to sell the Legislature on a multibillion-dollar rescue for <NAME/>. 
It's unclear what impact PG&E's proposal would have on <NAME/>'s attempt to avoid bankruptcy. <NAME/>'s creditors, already angered that the Legislature adjourned without passing the <NAME/>-backed plan, might conclude that <NAME/> is better off in bankruptcy and could push the Southern California utility into court, analysts said. 
The PG&E proposal involves a complicated series of property transfers and bond offerings that would leave the current PG&E Corp. split into two separate, publicly-traded companies. 
The utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric, would become strictly a retailer and would sell other assets -- including its hydro and nuclear plants, transmission wires and gas pipelines -- to PG&E Corp. for $4.06 billion in cash and IOUs. PG&E Corp. shareholders would receive stock in the slimmed-down utility, although the details of the stock transaction haven't been worked out. 
The bankruptcy proposal represents the fourth time in three years that PG&E has tried to remove its hydro plants from state control. The PUC and Legislature have resisted because of potential impacts on costs and the environment. 
Despite the criticism, PG&E said removing those assets from regulators' oversight is essential to making the plan work. Why? Because PUC rules limit how much money the utility can borrow against those assets, said utility spokesman <NAME/> Low. If the assets became property of PG&E Corp., the corporation could borrow a lot more money and use the proceeds to pay its debts. <NAME/> said he's had "in-depth discussions" with investment bankers about issuing new bonds. 
Also, by removing the generating plants from PUC oversight, the plan can produce more cash for debt repayment, said credit analyst <NAME/> Bodek of Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York. 
If state officials fight the plan, "the question arises, 'How do you discharge these (debts)?' " Bodek said. "Here's a plan that does that." 
The plan would pay creditors $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in bonds. Creditors with debts of more than $100,000 would get 60 percent in cash and 40 percent in bonds, which will be paid in 10 or more years, said <NAME/> Aronzon, attorney for a committee of unsecured creditors. 
"There's some credibility here, and it works," Aronzon said of the plan. 
<NAME/> Ackerman, a spokesman for independent generators, said his group would probably accept the plan, even if it means they have to wait years to get some of their money. 
Shareholders also endorsed the plan. PG&E Corp.'s stock jumped $1.22, to $15.72, on a day when the markets took another bad fall

Hi Mom,

<NAME/> just loves his apple checkboard.  Thanks again for it.

I am still feeling sick.  Last week my Dr. told me its just allergies/asthma, but I'm still feeling puny.  I trying to get in to see if I have a touch of bronchitis or something.

I'm going to forward this little list while I'm thinking of it.  Ordinarily, I'm not one of those people that believes in giving people a gift wish list.  It seems kind of rude and presumptious.  However, given that we may be traveling in the November-December time frame and unable to field the normal questions I receive about what Mr. <NAME/> is into -- I thought I'd provide this list:

Things <NAME/> Says He Wants for Christmas (That Santa isn't bringing) if anyone asks -- not he should expect to get these items (since some cost more than $20)

-<NAME/> Potter Game for Computer (MS-Windows)  (more expensive item)
-Backyard Football Game for Computer (MS-Windows)
-<NAME/> Potter Trading Cards
-Video or DVD of "Cats and Dogs"
-<NAME/> Potter Snapes Potion Kit (More expensive item)
-Ultra Grip Nerf Football

Incidentally, <NAME/> is asking Santa for the <NAME/> Potter Legos Set, a Levitating Game and an Air Snare Drum Game.


More Later

<NAME/>,  <NAME/> Braband had approved those agreements.  I know that the El Paso pipelines are very strict on any changes to the GISB form.  I did discuss removal of Section 3.2(b) for Mojave pipeline (an El Paso pipeline) and their attorney agreed.  Unfortunately he only handles the EP Pipelines in the west.  Might be worth another run at their legal to see if we can modify the GISB to meet our template.  Let me know if I can help.

<NAME/>- talked to Whalley on this. He said he is going to kill deal but needs to do it carefully so he doesn't de-motivate people. So I guess we should keep working on it but it most likely won't go anywhere. A big concern <NAME/> has now is that we have $7 billion of int'l assets and the fear is that we lose people and no one will be around to monitor and operate these assets. You need to use discretion on this but not waste too much time. <NAME/>

Branches:  only relates to those branches of a multibranch party, which under ISDA can ONLY be a bank.

Restrictions:  Things put in the restrictions column should be those things so critical to trading, payment/settlement or contract formation that you should not enter into a trade unless you read it.  It is not a place to dump general legal negotiation stuff.  Examples would be:  "masters limited to natural gas or crude oil trading only", "no payment netting between energy commodity and interest rate and currency transactions", "no oral trades allowed", "only the treasurer can enter to trades for the company", "all agreements for this counterparty require two signatures".  You can do a sort on the PENDING SWAP UPDATE - EXECUTED, which will then show you all the restrictions, then scroll down and look at the type of restrictions entered into for the different companies to get a flavor for these types of restrictions.  But we don't want to junk it up with general legal negotiation stuff.  Just critical, DON'T TRADE UNLESS YOU LOOK AT THIS STUFF.

Dear <NAME/>,

	Thank you so much for sharing!  I can't tell you what a sweet boy he is!! I have the picture of him today (with his eyes open) as my screen saver.  Everyone in my office is in love with <NAME/>!
	Well, I hope you are okay and have maybe caught up on some sleep.  Hopefully, <NAME/> will be a good sleeper.  I told <NAME/> that this was enough to make me want to get on a plane.  Maybe <NAME/>, <NAME/> & I will be able to come visit soon.  I'm so excited that <NAME/> will have a cousin near his age.  He has Riley (turned 2 yrs. on Oct 4th) and Peyton (was 3 yrs. in June) who are brothers and live in San <NAME/> (<NAME/>'s brother <NAME/>'s boys).  But we are thinking that we've never been to Memphis and it would be a great place to visit!
	<NAME/> is doing wonderfully.  As everyone will tell you, they grow up so fast.  Just enjoy every moment - these boys are little miracles!  <NAME/> has started saying alot of words (moon, house, ball, cookie, crackers, buckle) and he is going to be a lion for halloween - he's been practicing his roar.  What will <NAME/> be?  <NAME/> is also trying to put on his shoes and socks.  He is fascinated with buckles - he can buckle, but not unbuckle yet.  He is almost riding his tricycle.
	Everything else is good here.  My mom and <NAME/> have started driving here today.  They will get to <NAME/> tomorrow night.  <NAME/> is driving the Corvair in a parade Saturday and then, of course, we are watching the Baylor game.
	I'm so glad to hear your mom and dad are coming this weekend.  I bet they cannot wait.  I hope they are able to visit often.  It is so important to me that <NAME/> knows my mom, <NAME/>, my dad & Flo.  I was so lucky to get to grow-up with my grandparents in town and I wish that <NAME/> will have the same.
	Have fun with sweet <NAME/> and take care of <NAME/>.  It sounds like you all are doing great!

Love,
<NAME/>

I think that we should pursue both.  If we can convince the PUC that it's a good deal, and that it ought to include a dedicated rate component to cover it.  If the PUC agrees, then the rate component should cover PG&E's concern and they should be able to go forward.  Thoughts?

Senate Majority Leader Eager to Push Energy, Environmental Issues 	
<NAME/> Kuhnhenn 	
	
 	
07/06/2001 	
KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: Knight Ridder's Washington Bureau 	
	
	
	
Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World Reporter (TM) 	
 	
	
 	
WASHINGTON--Eager to exploit public dissatisfaction with President Bush's approach to energy and the environment, Senate Majority Leader <NAME/> Daschle wants to place those issues next on the Democratic agenda, before other initiatives popular with Democrats.  Daschle's aides and party strategists say the Senate's top Democrat wants to keep the White House on the defensive, draw attention to popular Democratic goals such as promoting conservation and alternate power sources, and inoculate his party against Republicans' charges that it has ignored the country's energy needs. Activists on both sides see potential for compromises that would lead to legislation Bush can sign. 	
	
   "With summer, and gas prices, and air conditioning -- this is what you go with," said Democratic pollster <NAME/> Yang. "It's an issue that people actually live every day. There are very few issues like that in politics."  Democrats think the energy issue has become an albatross for the White House. Recent polls show that a majority of the public disapproves of the way Bush is handling energy and environmental issues.  What's more, the House of Representatives voted to block the administration from drilling for oil and gas off Florida's gulf coast and in the Great Lakes. Both measures passed with support from 70 Republicans.  "When the Republican-controlled House soundly rejects key components of the president's energy policy, it signals an opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus that begins in the center," said Daschle spokeswoman <NAME/> Dunn.  The decision to highlight energy policy came late last week after Daschle met privately with his chairmen of key committees. Democrats present also called for action on raising the minimum wage, hate-crimes legislation, a prescription-drug plan for seniors and other issues popular with their supporters.  But concentrating on energy policy first gives Democrats an opportunity to seize what has been a Republican issue and turn it to their advantage, aides said.  Bush and Vice President <NAME/> Cheney are dogged by their backgrounds as former Texas oilmen. From the moment Cheney argued for more oil and gas production to satisfy the energy needs of the United States, Democrats portrayed Bush and him as beholden to special interests.  "The White House and Republicans are in the 35 percent end of public opinion on this," a top Democratic leadership aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said this week. "It's a loser every day for the Republicans."  With that in mind, Daschle and Sen. <NAME/> Bingaman, the New Mexico Democrat who heads the Senate's energy and natural resources committee, plan to have a comprehensive energy bill ready by the end of July. It will be a full- scale alternative to the Bush-Cheney program unveiled in May.  The first floor disputes on energy policy could occur as early as next week, when the Senate debates the spending bill for the Interior Department. Republicans and White House lobbyists will have their hands full fending off Democratic amendments to match the House bans on offshore drilling near Florida beaches and on national monument lands.  The White House helped defuse some of the oil-exploration dispute earlier this week by scaling back its plans to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. But huge disagreements remain over drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a centerpiece of Bush's energy plan. Some Democrats intend to offer an amendment to the Interior spending bill that would prohibit drilling in the refuge.  Democrats also want to highlight energy conservation and lower emissions of pollutants that contribute to global warming. One proposal, which combines conservation and anti- pollution goals, would raise gas-mileage requirements for sport utility vehicles. The National Academy of Sciences is studying fuel economy standards and is expected to issue recommendations to Congress later this month.  The energy debate also splits Senate Republicans, giving Daschle extra manpower to challenge Bush. Democrats can count on New England Republicans such as <NAME/> Chafee of Rhode Island and Olympia Snowe and <NAME/> Collins, both of Maine, to back several Democratic initiatives.  Sen. <NAME/> McCain, R-Ariz., who already has opposed Bush on the patients' bill of rights and campaign finance legislation, also has said he favors more conservation measures than the White House proposes.  "He'll be very prominent in cobbling a centrist coalition on the issue," said <NAME/> Wittman, a senior fellow at the conservative <NAME/> Institute research center and a political adviser to McCain. "You can already see the outlines of that proposal -- encouragement of conservation, some exploration, but everything is environmentally friendly."  The White House already has reacted to the criticism of its energy policies. Its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spending for renewable energy, but Bush restored some of the money later. He also has paid more attention to energy conservation, indicating support for spending on efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget.  But the president is not backing away from his position that the United States needs to become less dependent on foreign oil. And that, White House officials say, requires more oil and gas exploration in the United States. The energy plan Bush sent to Congress last week would authorize drilling in the Alaskan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to pay for research into alternative energy sources.  In addition to public disapproval of his stands on the environment and energy, the president is losing the sense of urgency that initially accompanied his energy proposals. Rolling blackouts in California are on the wane, gasoline prices are falling and last week <NAME/> Browne, the chief executive of BP oil, dismissed Bush's call for new oil refineries.  That gives Democrats a chance to seize the issue and attack the president without competing pressure from the public for quick solutions.  "It's a target of opportunity," said Burdett Loomis, a political scientist at the University of Kansas and an expert on the Senate. Like the patients' bill of rights, on which the public sided with Democrats, energy right now "is low-hanging fruit," he said.

No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the <NAME/> deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  

Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

Best,
<NAME/>

<NAME/>,  The contract itself does not have a confidentiality clause, but per <NAME/> <NAME/>'s email, Gulf does consider the contract proprietary information and does not want this info voluntarily disclosed at this time.  I forwarded the email to you earlier.

Concerning the emails etc., as I mentioned before, ECS has a copy of a Confidentiality Agreement that we executed by Gulf,  initialed by me as ECS attorney, but not signed by an officer of ECS.  Our business guys think we executed this agreement.  This CA would cover all information exchanged between Gulf and ECS.  I have asked <NAME/> Badder's to check with Gulf to obtain an executed copy.  Nothing in the CA agreements prohibit me from disclosing the CA. So we could potentially provide the copy of the CA we have to <NAME/>.  Obviously the correspondence between ECS and Gulf contains the commerical terms of our power deal as we negotiated with Gulf.  Given <NAME/>'s email and the CA copy I have in hand, I would not want to disclose the emails and memo's without Gulf's explicit permission.  Let me know if you have any ideas on the best way to approach this with WFLA.

I will be in Kazakhstan over Christmas and hope to touch base with your daughter to see about the possibility of locating a Christmas eve worship.  I think I've misplaced her email address.  If you wouldn't mind, would you forward it to me again.  Thanks and have a blessed holiday.

The EWS West Power URM desk will need to determine the $$ at stake and help us manage our financial exposure and the appropriate policy response.  It's their $$.  So far, my understanding from the desk is that our current policy recommendations (as outlined in the <NAME/> Smith memo) are the "preferred" outcome - I'll reconfirm.

<NAME/>, 

I have just learned that the Holland Club event will overlap with this event by about 30 minutes -- St. <NAME/> arrives at 10:30, so Cameron probably wouldn't get his gift until 11:00 at the earliest.  Also, since it is out in the boonies, it would take a while to get back inside the loop.  

Would it be possible for us to arrive late?  I'd hate to create a disturbance, but I think Cameron would like to attend both things.

In Germany, Berlin's minister for culture <NAME/> Goehler called the World Trade Center twin 110-story towers destroyed by the hijackers ``phallic symbols.'' The comment brought calls for her resignation, but also an explanation from Goehler. 
``In the context of my statement that the 'attacks were aimed symbolically at the heart of America,' I also made the comment that the towers are ``phallic symbols,''' she said. ``It was an answer to the question 'What sort of symbolic images did it remind me of?'''

<NAME/> --

Going forward Govt Affairs will coordinate with Services and Product Development (and other EWS and EES groups as appropriate, e.g. Credit) to ensure compliance with (1) licensing/registration, (2) bonding/security, (3) regulatory reporting, and (4) other.  I have asked <NAME/> Ogenyi to lead this effort for us.  We will need other groups to appoint a Lead for their teams as soon as possible (I will work with <NAME/>, Legal, and Product Development to find out the appropriate people).

I fully concur with <NAME/> that within all new Product Development activities there must be a clear analysis of our obligations and appropriate resource allocation to continue supporting the market activity.   As important, just because we don't want to attract new business in a given market doesn't mean that our responsibilities have ended.  We need to ensure that our Product Development activities are accounting for the costs of these obligations over the long-term.  To ensure that we are selling in accordance with applicable regulations, I would recommend that <NAME/> be on the Product Development sign-off sheet.

In addition, we have already begun reviewing obligations, etc. for our current market activity (both wholesale and retail).  I will talk with <NAME/> to build the matrix of issues you referenced.  Our goal is to make current all of our market obligations.

I will call you to provide an update on the market review when I have more information.  If you want to talk about this, please call.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

PS - I'll ask <NAME/> to give you an update on the IL bonding status.

I think there is still the possibility that, just like has happened to El Paso, that Enforcement could still open the case since FERC is still out trying to find a way to get us.   It is true that the ALJ did not help them out, but that decision is not binding upon the commission.    Neither <NAME/>, Drew or I are comfortable yet that we have the win.  We are pleased with the ALJ decision, but know that the ALJ did not get to the answer the Commission intended.

Any reason for that? It may be related to his transfer from EBS.

For your information, I have attached the current proformas (UBS and the standard).  I know <NAME/> and <NAME/> have had a lot of conversations on this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.  The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.  Webb knows but that's about it on the non-commercial side.

Hi, <NAME/>:

As you can see, I have forwarded the master agreement to Mr. Sill for execution.  When you receive the executed copies, please complete the notice information on the Schedule.  I'm sure <NAME/> can assist in the technical contacts if you aren't familiar with them.  In addition, please initial both copies and have <NAME/> Suttle initial both copies before they are signed by EBS <NAME/>/Pacific Pte Ltd.  Upon execution, please forward one fully signed copy to Mr. Sill and forward the other original copy to me in <NAME/>.

I am processing the original <NAME/> Corp. guaranty and will forward it to Uecomm when I receive it back from <NAME/> Corp. and receive confirmation from you that you have the master agreement as signed by Uecomm.

It was good.... I went down around noon and hung out for a couple of hours.  It is amazing how excited everyone is for the Texan's to start up.  Thank you very much for the tickets it was a lot of fun.  It seemed like everyone but me knew who they were going to take in the draft.  Look for a check the next couple of days I plan on sending you $25,000 that I would like you to put with the rest of my cash for now.

Thanks Again,

I know <NAME/> from when he worked for Commissioner Jesse Knight at the California PUC.  It's worth noting that Knight was the lone dissenting voice on the California restructuring fiasco.  I told <NAME/> that we probably didn't have anything for him in government affairs at this time, but that we could possibly help out by circulating his resume on the Hill, FERC and perhaps in the Western States legislative and executive branches (if we hear of anyone looking for his expertise on electric issues).  I am not asking anyone to make extra efforts ... but if you hear of someone looking, please pass <NAME/>'s resume along.

Good Evening

I ran a master download for December 1 so that over the next few days I can test the overwriting fix, and found two deals that are 24 hour deals, show scheduled hours of 1-24, but are segregated with the "OFF PEAK" deals. 

The deal numbers are:

576490.1	 
737863.1	 


Can you look and see if they are booked in a strange way that makes them fall into the wrong segregation category?

Oh, My Italian Amigos,

I just received a fax from Hotel Condotti and they do have availability for June 7 & 8 at a rate of Euro 233 ( which is about USD $204) which includes breakfast and taxes.


http://hotelcondotti.com/rooms.html

http://www.hotelfirenzeroma.it/ing/hotel.htm

Please check out each of the above web sites and let me know what you think.  The Condotti is a little more expensive, but certainly looks very nice.  We know that Firenze was fine and I'm certainly happy to stay there again if everyone is game.  

<NAME/>, do you have a preference?  <NAME/> please talk with <NAME/> and let me know what your vote is.   Also, let me know if you want me to check on other hotels in Rome.  Once I tally the votes, I'll confirm the hotel.


Thanks, <NAME/>.

<NAME/> had asked me whether this contract had ROFR or not because he thinks it should be terminated, but CAS is still reserving capacity for the contract because it has a ROFR flag on it in CBS.  I think that this contract does not have ROFR, but could you confirm this for me?  If my memory is correct, I thought that this agreement was always done just a month or two at a time and that at the end of each term it was negotiated with the price desk (& more recently TK) to roll for another month or so.  If I'm thinking of the right contract, that would mean that it did not have a ROFR (because it was not for a year or longer) and that it terminated 3/31/2001.

Could you check the contract file for me and look at the amendment history to confirm that the agreement did not have a year or longer term?  If not, then this agreement should not have the ROFR contract on it.

Let me know.  Thanks!

<NAME/>:

In connection with the upcoming <NAME/> Corp. Board Meeting, we have prepared proposed resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts on behalf of <NAME/> Corp.  The current resolutions are outdated because certain of the offices no longer exist or have changed.  In addition, <NAME/> Hickerson's group typically goes to <NAME/> Fastow when documents need to be signed or written or oral instructions need to be given to brokers to authorize the transfer of funds from <NAME/> Corp.'s brokerage account(s), in particular the account at Morgan <NAME/>.  <NAME/>'s title has changed and he has also asked that <NAME/> Glisan and <NAME/> DeSpain be authorized to sign documents and to give instructions in connection with these brokerage accounts.

The attached resolutions have been drafted using the December 13, 1994 resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts, with the exception of the deletion of non-existing offices, change in officer titles and the addition of <NAME/> Glisan and <NAME/> DeSpain.  I am attaching a copy of the certificate we sent to Morgan <NAME/> in connection with the opening of the account for <NAME/> Corp. certifying the December 13, 1994 resolutions.

Congratulations on being team leader for the video.  

Here are some ideas:

1.	A long winded VP drones on and on asking questions about an analyst that is not in his/her group while the camera flashes to other bored VP's.  It could start with sighs and rolling eyes then build to comical efforts to be put out of their misery. (gun to head or rope around neck)
2.	Include some digs at <NAME/> Lavorato's quirks like always pulling up his shirt sleeves.

Just some ideas to get things started.  Obviously, the gas market is slow today.

<NAME/>,

A dangerous environment is brewing on the trading floor.  We have very large positions and people are becoming more frustrated with the work environment, uncertain about future employment and now with new information about Lay's "golden parachute", I am concerned that not everyone may act in the best interest of the Company (hero or zero attitude) or at a minimum may not be in the best frame of mind to trade.  I hate to suggest it but do you need to reduce the people allowed to take risk for the Company? (similar to what was done when we sold HPL).  The general feeling is that everyone at the top is taking care of themselves and the "little" people that have been making the money for the Company are left out in the cold.  I also suggest that you move quickly to ensure appropriate compensation for key traders into next year.

I know the first move I suggested would have the effect of reducing morale further but this group has a lot of risk on for people that may not be 100% commited to <NAME/>.  This may be too drastic action at this point but I think it should watched closely.

Here are my comments

1.  I wouldn't agree the caps have hurt liquidity.  In fact, in the Northwest at least, they have actually increased liquidity.  Any decrease in liquidity can be attributed primarily to a couple of things (1) uncertainty about the level of the cap and (2) when the day-ahead prices trade above the cap (removing marketers as sellers).

I would propose the following cap timelines.  First of all, I think it's important that FERC realize the "spot" market really is two separate markets, what we call the "day-ahead" cash markets, and "day-of" real-time markets.  The 24-hour designation doesn't dovetail with the current market timelines and is a source of confusion that can adversely affect liquidity and dispatch of power plants.  For example, day-ahead cash typically trades from 6:00 am to approximately 7:00 am for next day deliveries.  However, on Thursdays the WSCC OTC market trades for Friday and Saturday deliveries, and on Fridays, we trade for Sunday and Monday (all of this can be adjusted for various reasons, but this is the typical schedule).  If we held to the 24-hour spot cap literally, then Tuesday thru Friday the cap would apply to the day-ahead market, but would not apply to Saturday and Monday.  This obviously cannot be an intended consequence.  I recommend the cap timeline be consistent with the day-ahead WSCC OTC trading timelines.

In addition, there is some question with respect to what cap applies to the day-ahead market.  What if the forecast calls for much higher temperatures and it is assured that real-time markets will be trading above the 85% threshold?  Assume that stage I, II or even III is a certainty.  It seems prudent that a higher day-ahead price cap be established (still consistent with FERC's guidelines).  Why?  Because you would want units prescheduled to have high reserve margins going into real-time, rather than scrambling to dispatch units real-time.  It seems like it would be prudent for some independent board to set the day-ahead price cap equal to either the 85% or Stage I limit prior to trading time.  This board would have to have regional representatives in order to be truly effective.  Establishing the cap does not have to be cumbersome or time consuming, in fact, it should be fairly easy.

The cap governing real-time transactions is clear.  However, what isn't clear is what happens when the new Stage I cap is actually lower than the existing 85% of stage I cap.  For example, during the first couple of days in July the real-time cap was operating under the 85% of Stage 1 criteria, approximately $92.  The ISO hit a Stage I and Stage II and the price actually fell to the $70s.  This created uncertainty exactly when it shouldn't happen.  As a result supply was apparently affected in California and the Southwest for a few hours across the peak.  It seems odd that prices should fall real-time as reserve margins decrease.  One could argue this is a good reason why caps should be tied to daily gas prices, but assuming that isn't an option, I propose something like this:  The DAY BEFORE (around 2200) the CAISO, or preferably an independent body, would determine the real-time non-Stage cap as well as a Stage minimum.  While in a stage I, II, or III the hourly price would be the HIGHER of the non-stage price cap OR the recalculated Stage price.  If the Stage I price turned out lower, then the non-stage price would be used for that hour, but the recalculated Stage I cap (and corresponding 85% price) would apply for the NEXT operating day, and for day-ahead cash trading for the next trade day.  This provides information before the trading period (enhancing liquidity) and eliminates strange price movements during real-time.  It also fits the FERC price cap paradigm.

2.  Marketer prices.  I think there is a clear bias against marketers in the order.  But given the fact it seems deliberately slanted against marketers, there are clearly three areas where marketers should be allowed to recover costs that are easily demonstrable.  First would be losses at a tie into California.  If we sell at the cap and incurr losses, then we can't sell at the cap.  Second would be the 10% credit premium.  Credit issues apply whether you're a marketer or generator.  Third would be call options.  It seems if the market trades above the cap and above the strike in a call option, that a party should be able to exercise and sell.  I'm not sure what the difference between a peaking plant and a call option is.

Why can't we use AEP's position against them in their own backyard (Ohio).   AEP's position is that you can't have effective retail markets without real-time energy markets (which I agree with), yet there is no real-time energy market with ancillary clearing prices in AEP's service territory in Ohio.

Can we use their own testimony against them?

I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you would like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.

How is it going?  I don't want to make this a big deal, (quite frankly you and me have better things to spend our time on, and the dollar amount relating to these cuts is trivial) but with respect to cuts in the future I think it is important that we teach the people underneath us the correct way to handle these issues, so that in the future we do not have to be involved.  Below is a quick dialog that <NAME/> Johnston and I have had with respect to the cuts and what we can and can not do.

This seems to be blown way out of proportion by <NAME/> Heal and if there is anything I can do to make this GO AWAY please let me know.

I know you were being nice and I am sorry.

I really can't put into words how it feels to get out of bed in the morning right now.  It takes me 1/2 hour to get myself together.  

I shouldn't have been so mean to you.  I know you were being nice.  I know this isn't a reasonable request, but these aren't reasonable times -- I just need some space when I'm getting ready in the morning.  

The heat and the fact that I couldn't have coffee this morning just put me over the edge.

My physical was ok.  Listen to this, because they are a preventive medicine shop he can't prescribe antibiotics.  So then, I couldn't get my travel vaccines, until I find out whether I have a sinus infection and need to be on antibiotics. 

Am I just dreaming these last few months or is this really my life?

I just got a call from a dealmaker who is going to lunch today with a group of business people in from Russia and wants to get a Confidentiality Agreement in place before the meeting.  We have never looked at Russian law before, have you?  If you have, can you direct me as to whether Confidentiality Agreements are enforceable in Russian courts, should we include our standard arbitration provision and would such provision be enforceable, would we be better off getting the customer to submit to the jurisdiction of the NY courts, and lastly are there any other provisions we should be putting in the agreement.

Is there anyone there that can give me some quick help?  Attached is our standard form of NDA...Thanks!

<NAME/> --

Fine work. Looks like we are moving forward in the SE.  

A couple of discussion points.    I am still not so much in love the LMP as this paper makes it seem you are (I don't believe there is a perfect solution).  Also, the document is not consistent relating to Control Area consolidation.  For instance, the issue around CA or RTO with tagging makes no sense if there is only one CA - the RTO.  This is important to highlight to the ALJ.  The easiest way to solve the problem is to do away with the archaic systems of the old world.  Also, I still don't fully understand why we are happy that the SAC gets to pick the IMA.  I personally despise the concept of a SAC - never has worked when times get tough.  Also, no real discussion (or maybe I missed) of timing to implement - next phase?

Anyway, great work in the mediation.  Keep pushing these guys from the South.  

Thanks,

Lorelie, I know we did not get to finish our conversation. call me on Friday ( if you so desire or have time) . 

In thinking through this issue, I am not really sure that it matters how these deals are now being confirmed, nominated or paid. settled or netted against. I am not even sure that we can do anything to change them once we filed.  

There is a good chance I am not thinking about it properly and will be happy to discuss on friday.

Thanks,

I'll try to attend this meeting if you need me.  I have a CLE class out of the office from 12-2 today.  But, I would like to dispel the suggestion that Jerry put together the spreadsheet for me.  I'm very enthusiastic about the AR tools that Jerry & <NAME/> have developed and I'm happy that the reports seem to also serve the needs of the finance folks, but I feel like I made it clear that the customer service reps (like Marion) that are on the front line of collecting monies are the main clients of Jerry's reports.   If the tool needs to be modified to better meet their needs -- then it should be modified.  I'm all for automation and less manual intervention.

<NAME/>, 
Below are some comments on the deals I have been working. Who would you like for me to hand these over to?
<NAME/>/Centana 
Money wires will be complete on April 1. The proceeds from the transaction were received on Friday and the money that needs to be put into escrow will be sent out Monday, April 1. I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\centana duke, where I have put the files for the cash request forms, wire transfer forms and the mini- DASH. There is also a cashflow.xls that explains the calculations for the dollars. I also have a file on my desk. The commercial contact for <NAME/> Field Services was <NAME/> Swedinsky 713-627-6265. In order to finish the transaction, a decision needs to made with respect to the contract and a settlement on pre-petition dollars. 
Ponderosa Energy Partners 
I have been helping <NAME/> Hill and <NAME/> <NAME/> manage the supply for the Tenaska IV power plant. I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\tenaskaIV where I have put files relevant to the project. The file PPEP2.doc are some of my notes that I think will be helpful to whom ever takes it over. I  recommend <NAME/> to help manage this, if that works for you.
Pace Energy 
I have a letter from Pace that explains what actions they have taken. The dollar figures are less than $100,000. 
General Land Office. 
I have a file that contains a copy of the contract between GLO and ERAC and a copy of an internal deal sheet for the natural gas volumes.

GLENDALE, CA- <NAME/> guitarist <NAME/> Vai wowed a group of neighborhood children with his spectacular guitar pyrotechnics Monday. "His behind-the-head guitar solo was so wicked," said <NAME/> Hetzel, 11, one of six children blown away by Vai's fretboard wizardry. "He also did this thing where he held the guitar between his legs and played it with a bow." The impromptu performance is believed to be the most impressive display of its kind since September 2000, when Joe Satriani "showed off a few licks" at a Southfield, MI, bar mitzvah.

Glad to see you working on some good stuff : )

you need to pull out a black sholes calculation and input the varialbles that you were given
and then call a power options trader to ask for a marekt to check the resonableness of the model
models can be way off on options due to skew and market conditions

I spoke to you a couple of months ago about purchasing an American Drew bedroom furniture set.  At the time, I was purchasing the furniture from a company in North <NAME/> after trying to get a competitive deal from one of your stores.  We had a very frank discussion about being competitive and you stated that you would be very competitive with any future purchases and I would like to take this opportunity to take you up on that offer if it still stands.  After several unexpected delays, I have canceled my order and received a full refund from the North <NAME/> company.  If you can get to a price close to the price we discussed before, I would like to purchase the furniture from you immediately.  I am sure you are busy, however if you or a manager of one of your stores can call me, I would like to discuss purchasing the furniture.  You can reach me at 713-853-5933 at work or on my cell at 713-432-7163.

<NAME/>,

Lavo has given me the idea that <NAME/> Redmond may not be part of NETCO and it is possible that the Texas Gas Origination business may go away completely.  I would like to talk to you before you make a final decision.  I do not see it as a big money generator but similar to the East and Central it is a source of information for the trading business.  It is even more imperative to have a couple of people talking to producers and customers in Texas because pipeline flow data is not accessible as it is in the interstate market.  My opinion is if you had one person covering the producers and one covering the customers that would give us adequate coverage for information and make a little orig in the process.  Give me a call to discuss at 713-853-3079.

Regards,

<NAME/>

I have some errands I need to run at lunch.  I can pick my things up then.  About Las Vegas,  I never received a confirm on <NAME/> Gains last week.  I am not sure what happened, however, I called the Mirage directly and he is sold out that weekend.  Anything else you would like to see?  What about for dinner, any place special you would like to go?

Thanks so much for your note.  I have assumed my new role as COO right at budget time, so in addition to being on top of the budget for my operations team of about 1000, I have picked up responsibility for the other budgets under <NAME/> Net Works, another 2500 people that deliver our IT infrastructure, our system maintenance and development projects and our e-commerce platforms.  The learning curve is steep right now, but fun!

Your association with Vanderbilt sounds interesting.  CIndy is keeping me abreast of your project.  I sincerely hope that this proves to be a great fit for you.  

While everyone in the country has been profoundly impacted by the terrorist attacks, I can only imagine that the feeling is heightened for those of you that live in New York.  My thoughts are with you and your family.  --<NAME/>

Thanks for the info.  I wanted to pick your brain about cars for Mom and Dad.  My initial research of Large Cars and Luxury Cars in Consumer Report did not yield a lot of obvious choices to me.

  I only considered CR "Recomended " cars.  There are a few options in the $20,000 to $25,000 range for example the Ford Crown <NAME/>/Mecury Grand <NAME/>; but I do not believe the cars in this price range will give them the same luxury and comfort that they are used to.  The only car in the $30,000 to $35,000 range is the Buick Park Avenue which I think will be a pretty close fit to what they are driving now but I'm not sure they want to spend this kind of money.  Of course the really nice luxury cars that will sure to satisfy them for example, the <NAME/> Town Car and Cadillac Deville are in the $40,000 to $45,000 range.

Dad said he spent $23,000 for his Olds 98 in 1991 and would like to have something that rides as quite and comfortable as it but not spend big bucks.  My plan at this time is to focus on the Crown <NAME/>/Grand <NAME/> and the Park Avenue first and see if they come close to meeting Mom and Dad's needs.

Any Thoughts?

Love,

<NAME/>

I can make myself available this evening or tomorrow evening to discuss this and other topics as your calendar permits.  I actually think that we should not be pressured by anyone to fill this position in the next few days.  If <NAME/> would like to resign effective the end of the month (or some other date), I think that would be fine.

2.  <NAME/> Energy Markets
3.  Convergence of Commodity Trading Forms

<NAME/>'s panel discussion on new markets
E-commerce panel

I have also copied several of the lawyers in our London office who are active in the derivatives and commodity trading world to solicit their suggestions for appropriate topics to be added to the agenda.

I think we should install 15 minute metering capability and start serving these customers physically.   In order to grow this business, we need to find out if we can serve retail load directly in an efficient and cost-effective manner.   The quicker we can achieve physical delivery capability, the quicker we can define our true cost of serving these customers.

Looks very good.  We need to stress the points on what we need FERC to do -- fix their mistakes in the Rehearing.  One other point, maybe we should stress that FERC could open these proceedings and not delay the decision because the Cal ISO is taking so long.  Also, don't be shy about describing how the process is going so slowly and the "abuses" of the Cal ISO and its lack of independence.

EPMI purchased 225 MW of Calender 03 NEPOOL ICAP (Installed Capability) from Calpine at $1.35/kW/Mo.   The parties agreed via a recorded phone conversation (<NAME/> Posoli and <NAME/> Presto) that the LCRA lawsuit would be dropped and neither party would have any further obligations with respect to that lawsuit.

The parties attorneys have 48 hours to agree on lawsuit termination language, at which time the ICAP transaction becomes a binding obligation on both parties.

well, i am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that.  there is not much to do and basically we are waiting around to see what happens to the trading operations, which are supposed to be sold to an investment bank in a week or so.  we'll see ...  at first it was refreshing to not have anything to do and a welcome relief from the frenetic atmosphere i'm used to here, but now it's a challenge to find productive ways to fill the time and i don't work very long days.  

i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  it feels good to be back, too.  

your schedule sounds very packed - maybe you would like to suggest a time/place that fits in?  it's been forever since i've seen you and i would be up for anything:  coffee, lunch, dinner, drinks, basically anything.  

take care,
cooper

<NAME/> Kingerski informed me that you and some team members were going to visit ConEd to discuss the Benchmark Rate Swap.  I think it's a great idea (<NAME/> Gahn and I had discussed something similar a few years ago when he ran URM).  

My only thoughts for you would be: 1) maybe difficult to do the swap with the Utility (given PUC oversight), but the Holding company should be in the same place financially and should be protected from PUC scrutiny and 2) being long T&D (assuming that you don't sell 100% of the position to customers) creates interesting regulatory questions.

I'd love to sit down with you to discuss this product.

This counterparty has transact ability on European and Asian Metals.  They have hardly transacted at all, only power, much less any metals.  We figure they are using the website for price discovery.

Privileged and Confidential -- request for legal advice.
 
Some further questions:
 


Are we required to have a formal severance plan?  Can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a case-by-case basis (perhaps with "rule of thumb" guidelines)?

If we are required to have such a plan, should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies?

My original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern.  Perhaps because our plans are complicated, we have had occasions where an employee was told something, what he/she was told was incorrect, he/she changed position based on what he/she was told, and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake.  Obviously, the right answer is to get it right the first time, but on those occasions where we made the mistake, do we have the flexibility to fix it?

Can he still be considered or will he need to wait for the next round?

<NAME/>,

Last night I spoke to two potential candidates for the trading track, <NAME/> Carlsson and <NAME/> Considine.

<NAME/> is currently tutoring at Hofstra after leaving an option trading position.  I would recommend bringing <NAME/> to <NAME/> for further interviews based on his technical knowledge.  The biggest drawback was his current situation might show a lack of motivation.

<NAME/> was working as an equity market maker.  He is interested in making a change to a job where he can develop more expertise.  He is seeking to develop a better understanding of the market he trades.  The trading track would be an excellent match for his desires.  I would also recommend bringing <NAME/> to <NAME/> for further consideration.

The orig trading books can be set up at a later date.  It should be a while before we have any activity of that sort.  We ran financial liquidations because we have not had any additions to the financial terminations.  I am working on one more big set of counterparties who had auto-termination language in their master agreements.  I vote we catch up with all the information we have as of today and then run liquidations on Monday.  What do you guys think?

You or <NAME/> need to address the various groups with whatever generic information you can as to where we are in the process, expected timeline, hurdles before start up again, starting VAR and general organizational structure.  People are moving from frustration to feeling insulted that they are expected to sit still with no information.  I know you have a lot on your plate but if we really want people to hang in there a little longer before we address each individual's situation they need some sense of when they can expect closure.

Good question.  All cash outflows have an impact, so it is probably best just to emphasize not spending unnecessary dollars.  We have asked our direct reports to carefully consider travel (is it really necessary, and if so, can only 1 person make the trip instead of earlier times when we might have sent two or three persons), off-site meetings (can an <NAME/> conference room work just fine), happy hours (should get approved by <NAME/>, <NAME/> or me ahead of time, and we need to be comfortable with business purpose), outside services and hiring.  I think that you could share this with the assistants.  

It is very important, especially now, to have updated contact information for employees.  All assistants should make sure that cell and home phone numbers are up-to-date.  

Please thank everyone for their focus and dedication during these tough times.  I will let you know if I think of anything else regarding spending.  --<NAME/> 

Just thought of this:  We should have all approvers within the "ibuyit" and "ibuyit-payables" systems look closely at and approve all purchases and payments.  Assistants in the past may have accessed requests on line for their bosses and automatically approved things to keep them going in the system.  We should be actively reviewing and approving or disapproving all expenditures.

Two things:  When Aleck said that he was leaving "effective immediately," does that mean one can't use email to send him a note to wish him well?  If that's the case, do we have a forwarding telephone number for him?

Also, just wanted to make sure you're aware that Calger continues to express concerns about us having any fingerprints on any attacks on the contracts.  His concerns are two-fold:  Generally, he thinks it would be very damaging to our commercial reputation, since many of the folks holding the lousy contracts are folks we regularly transact with. And specifically, we're tied up with Allegheny (sp?).  

I've told him that we don't like the contracts, that we're talking to folks about how bad they are, but we're "staying under radar" and stating publicly that we never support the unilateral abrogation of anyone's contract rights.

<NAME/>,

Thanks so much for sending me your friend's resume.  He certainly has a strong academic and work history.

Unfortunately, it is not <NAME/>'s practice to hire attorneys right out of law school.  We prefer that our candidates have at least 4-6 years (minimum) experience at a big law firm or substantial corporate law department before they are eligible for consideration here.  The rationale is that we have so much to do that we really cannot provide adequate training, which is critical for new lawyers; nor can we take the time necessary to supervise and review work of lawyers who don't have the requisite experience.

So, please thank your friend for his interest.  If you would like, I would be happy to visit with him about other types of opportunities in the legal profession, from law firms to some corporate legal departments that do hire straight out of law school.  Alternatively, he may be a candidate for the Associate and Analyst Program, if he doesn't want to practice law.

Call me with any questions.

Please forward the information to Eddie Leschber and Laynie East.  I know the origination was classified as Gas Assets but their transaction count was included in our budget since all of their pricing is structured in our group.  If those transactions are not included in our count then our middle marketing transaction targets for the 1st and 2nd quarters need to move to Gas Assets.  Ask Eddie and Laynie how they want to handle it.

Here is how Gator's treat there young.  Also, you are  correct, the API polls have Florida ranked one, Miami ranked two, and Florida State ranked 6.  Florida did not have the most vote for the number one place (Miami had more) but non the less are coming out of the gate in the number one spot.  Do you think the sports writers spent all their time in Florida, or what?  Crazy!

<NAME/>,

I understand that you are the contact person for MHI concerning the ash spec for the 501F turbine being used on the Ft. <NAME/> project.  I have been working with <NAME/> Tezyk to finalize all issues concerning this fuel oil spec. Please let me know as soon as possible what the MHI response is regarding the inability to get 0% ash fuel oil.   We are trying to get closure on this issue so we can order the fuel oil to replace that which we caused FPUA to burn to begin construction on the site.

Thanks!

Thank you for your thoughts.  I am fine.   Our pipeline companies were not included in the bankruptcy petition and we are continuing operations normally.  While these have certainly been stressful times and a sad day for the many <NAME/> employees that lost their jobs today, we have not had any workforce reductions in our area.  It's a little lonely in the building and I have to make sure to put my lipstick on before I go down to the lobby to face all the TV cameras camped out down there!

     I had approved an offsite Happy Hour for our Market Services Group following our string of emergencies (about a $2500-$3000 expenditure).  Considering everything that has happened, we're reviewing all costs, whether previously approved or not, and cutting where we can.  This is one that I don't think I should pull unless you feel strongly that I should.  Let me know your thoughts.

Sorry if I blew your party girl cover with one of your colleauges. <NAME/> and I were out on one of our many walks and I thought I would say hi. <NAME/> you are feeling better now. Saturday was fun.

Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General <NAME/> Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 

The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies

We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said <NAME/> Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, <NAME/> Companies (WMB, news, msgs) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by <NAME/> during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the <NAME/> contract was signed. 

"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the <NAME/> contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." 

The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE, news, msgs) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. 

The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. 

The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San <NAME/> Chronicle reported Monday. 

The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. 

CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI, news, msgs) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance <NAME/> LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) and Calpine Corp. (CPN, news, msgs), according to the report. 

Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.

I had a conversation with Belco prior to the receipt of the documents <NAME/> forwarded on down to you.  I think before we make any response in the nature of what you are discussing below I think we might want to have a meeting or get <NAME/> involved because that is not what Belco has in mind at all.  Although I understand from <NAME/> Credit's point of view Belco is not longer in the drivers seat with respect to the Belco/Westport relationship, I think we still need to tread gingerly with how we deal with Belco or <NAME/> Lay might be getting a phone call from Mr. Belfer (and I don't want my name to be brought up in that conversation!).  When you get back in the office let's pow-wow about how to approach this.

Greetings Professor:
I regret that I was unable to attend class last night.  Few items:

--I assume that you returned papers.  I will be on campus tomorrow and can pick it up then if you like.  Or if you'd prefer, you can drop it in my box in the student room at Haas (evening MBA boxes).  Or if you'd like to make some other arrangement, just let me know.

--I assume that our third paper is due by close-of-business on Wednesday, December 12.

Thanks very much.

This looks fine -- have we released us from any and all obligations that may have arisen before the date the agreement is signed?  I don't want there to be any other surprises, so I'd like to include "known and unknown" type language here.  Also, does the definition of ECT include all parents, shareholders, affiliates, employees, attorneys, etc?  Let's be very clear.  I'd also like a covenant not to sue signed by both Clonch and his attorneys.

It really was unbelievable.  Our neighborhood usually doesn't have too much trouble but the velocity of the rain (at one point they say it was 6" per hour) was so high that it just couldn't drain away that fast.  The water got so high that it was several inches high in the garage (not high enough to get in the car), covered the pool and completely surrounded the house.  It looks like it covered the porch and got right up to the top of the slab since some of the floor boards are starting to warp, but not as high as the door sills since none actually came in.  Just one more inch and I'd be in big trouble.  Luckily I slept through the whole thing - if I'd been awake I would have totally freaked and started carrying rugs & furniture to the second floor -- a lot of trouble and anxiety for nothing since it never did come inside.  The garage apt. tenant parks on the street and her car had water inside and it wouldn't start without being jumped.  I got home about midnight the night it happened and it was raining but the street was clear -- no standing water anywhere.  By the time I got up in the morning it was all gone.

Interstate 10 where it goes near our place (say from downtown out to the loop) looked like a river - the water filled the entire thing all the way up to the bottoms of the overpass bridges!  I didn't see it myself but I hear that 59 was the same way where it dips down between Montrose and Shepherd.  You missed a big one!

I know it must be frustrating being a ocean away and not really knowing what is going on.  I can assure you that at times I too feel that I do not know everything that is going and that is probably correct.  I can tell you that <NAME/> McMahon did receive the offer from the <NAME/> Bank of Scotland at or around RAB.  I have supplied him the potential financial impact of <NAME/> accepting that offer.  As of yesterday no decision had been made about responding to their offer.  I suspect that a decision should be made early next week.  I would appreciate your thoughts as soon as you can supply them to me.

<NAME/> Lay and Dynegy have both characterised <NAME/>'s investments in water assets as non-core which means of cource that they will be divested in due time.  I would think that that would be the final straw that triggers the goodwill impairment.  We all recommended that if <NAME/> could not support the goodwill remaining on the books then we should proceed with trying to sell Wessex at or around RAB.  That is where we are right now.  Again, please send me your comments.  I would try to keep this confidential since we have not yet made a descision.  I am sorry if I have not done a good job of communicating with you the past few weeks.  Things are quite hectic as you can imagine.

<NAME/>:

The customers appearing on <NAME/>'s list have been assigned to various lawyers in the swap group.  There are 22 parties on the list and 16 of these parties have ISDA Master Agreements with ENA.  We will focus on the ISDA customers first.  We will use the template developed by <NAME/> for Entergy-Koch as a basis for the 16 parties.  The template will be customized for each of the 16 parties.  <NAME/> has a preliminary template underway and it should be further refined by October 19.  Using that  template, our goal is to produce six (6) new amendments each week.  We should finish the ISDA customers in about three weeks (first drafts).  The remaining customers have no master agreement in place or an ECT Master Agreement.  Those six (6) customers include:

	Sempra Energy Trading Corp. (old master)
	Morgan <NAME/> Capital Group Inc. (old master)
	Dynegy Marketing and Trade (old master)
	Ameren Energy (none)
	American Electric Service Power Corporation (none)
	PacificCorp Power Marketing Inc. (under negotiation with ECC)

The physical power group can coordinate the amendments with the members of the swap group listed above by forwarding drafts to us.

Please let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks.  <NAME/>

I was afraid she'd think I was being difficult if I mentioned my displeasure at being pushed into the holiday airfare timeframe, not to mention my concerns about missing <NAME/>'s Christmas events in December and our nanny holiday issue.
My gut tells me that we should tackle this by trying to get some sort of understanding about when translation will be completed and when our papers will be forwarded to Kazakhstan.

FYI.  Appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiation.

Best,
<NAME/>

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 
This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 
In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 
Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 
But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California <NAME/>, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 
As massive as the <NAME/> deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 
Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 
Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 
Duress alleged
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 
"We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said <NAME/> Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." 
Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 
<NAME/> Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San <NAME/>, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 
"The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 
"Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. 
Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 
Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San <NAME/> attorney <NAME/> Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray <NAME/> overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 
He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
"To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." 
The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
"First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said <NAME/> Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.
Willingness to deal
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 
The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 
Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 
For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
"In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said <NAME/> Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." 
Some experts believe <NAME/> wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 
Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
"The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said <NAME/> Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 
The San <NAME/> company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 
Sempra says contract fair
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 
San <NAME/>-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 
<NAME/> Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 
"It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. 
But V. <NAME/> White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 
White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
"There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 
"But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?"

OC Register, 10.07.01
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 
Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 
The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 
Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 
"We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) <NAME/> <NAME/> is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said <NAME/> Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 
A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 
In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 
Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides, an authority board member. 
Said <NAME/>: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 
Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 
The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 
The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 
Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 
"I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said <NAME/> Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 
Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 
Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 
Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 
"I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said <NAME/> <NAME/>, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 
The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is <NAME/>, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of <NAME/>' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 
The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
"It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman <NAME/> Keeley, D-<NAME/>, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 
Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 
<NAME/> said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
"The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' <NAME/> said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

Attached is an organizational statistics summary for the first half of 2001.  The HR organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population.  A few highlights from this report:

The employee base continues to grow (though on a significantly slower pace than 2000).
Terminations (voluntary and involuntary) are up dramatically this year.
Our "contribution loss" (a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving) has gone up, indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods.  However, those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations (EBS, the former EE&CC and HPL).
Let us know if you would like to see additional items on the report or if you have questions about the data.

<NAME/>,

I noticed in the san macos record that some zoning changes were underway.  First, I wanted to make sure our property would not be affected.  Second, part of the land that is being rezoned is targeted for "seniors".  I would like to explore the possibility of developing a seniors project ( not assisted living). Maybe we could look at the property mentioned below.   As I have mentioned,  my goal is to invest around $2 million in real estate over the next two years.  At the current rate that amount would cover the equity requirements for 4 projects assuming I continued to have minority interest partner like <NAME/>.

Here is the article:

Sector 2 plan geets boost from council  By MURLIN EVANS - Staff Reporter  Home and landowners in northwestern San <NAME/> will soon have a revised future land use plan to consult for development in the area.  The San <NAME/> City Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two Land Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 square mile area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable and appropriate for the region.  Significant to the revisions are those affecting a controversial tract owned by resident <NAME/> Weatherford at the corner of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street).  Weatherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of various city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner says were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two plan.  Proposed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no direct effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density residential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven additional acres of low density residential.  In addition, the total eight acres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is suggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing development in the revised future land use plan.  The total 10 acres of commercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to "community commercial" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ensure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete with buffering and landscaping.  A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed to separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan.  However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew some concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may pose on the busy state highway.  Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing the proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Avenue.  While the state highway department and city would have input into the plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director <NAME/> Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford.  Council member <NAME/> Hughson supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sector Plan, but evaluating a developer's plans for possibly locating one in the area as development proceeds.  "I'd rather say "no' and if someone comes us with a really good idea, look at it then," Hughson said.  Councilman <NAME/> Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of the curb cut.  "It seems to me we're asking for a bunch of accidents to happen there," Mihalkanin said.  A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclude curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San <NAME/> Mayor <NAME/> Chiu and council members Joe Cox and <NAME/> Mayhew voting against the move. Council member <NAME/> Castex <NAME/> was not present at the meeting.  Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from several residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good compromise.  Oak Heights resident <NAME/> McBride, who has been an active critic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concerning the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests of the city as a whole.  "This is not a victory for one side or the other," said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to Weatherford's initial plans for his property, "but a victory for the City of San <NAME/>. We started out with all R-1...we've come a long way."

<NAME/>,  all is correct except that <NAME/> <NAME/> should get two flat screens instead of <NAME/> and me getting a third panel.  However, I did want to mention to you that I would like for <NAME/> to have a third flat screen since she handles all of our EOL transactions thereby giving her a screen for Dashboard/Pipeline Profile, Outlook and EOL.  Is there an extra one around for her?  
 
Many thanks,

<NAME/>- Thanks for your note. Before <NAME/> D. left she had requested additional resources and we began making arrangements to get people in place. We have assigned Tracy Ngo, <NAME/> Sacks, <NAME/> Radous and <NAME/> Conwell to power. We also have moved other RAC people into credit, <NAME/> Ruane (VP), <NAME/> Curry (Dir), and <NAME/> North (Mgr). Unfortunately it takes some time to get these people trained on transactional credit issues but they should come along quickly. We are in the market for more.

It might be helpful to know if we could clone Tracy, how many would you need, given your plans in the market. Tracy is one of our best people. Also, does being in <NAME/> work or do we need resources in Portland. 

I'll meet w/ Tracy next week when she is in <NAME/> and get her views as well. 

Please don't hesitate to let me know if we aren't keeping up and of course if you are gearing up for a new market push and anticipate additional needs let us know ASAP because there is a 12 month or so training period required for a strong performer to get up the <NAME/> curve. Thanks, <NAME/>

Hi everyone!

Once again I find myself being tasked by <NAME/> Storey. <NAME/> has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files (models and data) that are critical to our business (I don't think MP3's count) into one directory on the network. This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco. The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great. Each group should probably have one person in charge of the directory so there isn't any overlap. Call me with any ?'s/

We will be disclaiming various Life Insurance and JROS accounts. <NAME/> Cohen reffered a Trust lawyer to us by the name of <NAME/> Frierson (713-621-7007). We are going to have her do the legal work on the disclaiming and trust setup.

When the disclaiming process is done, she can coordinate with you the final list of probate assets so you can finish the court work.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks,

<NAME/>

Attached are all live financial deals by risk type.  As you can see, the price data is too large to fit into one tab.  

After tomorrow, I will no longer have access to the estate files.  <NAME/> Couch will be taking over the responsibility for the estate risk group and will be able to assist you with your requests going forward.

Hi <NAME/>: 
I'm sorry I did not get back to you yesterday. I was out of the office. 
I received your request regarding the contingent beneficiary for your father's life insurance, SIP, SAPP and Voluntary Cash Deferral Plan. Unfortunately, Ayco does not have access to this information. For all of these types of requests, Marsh has asked that the requesting party send a letter to Marsh & McLennan to the special UP.OF. Box that has been set up: 
Benefits Processing - WATCH 
UP.OF. Box 2002 
New York, NY 10108-2002 
If we can be of any further assistance, please let us know.

FYI.  I ran into <NAME/> last Friday.  He told me (insisted, in fact) that <NAME/> was paying everyone in February.  He told me (insisted, again) that they would have all necessary approvals from the PUC in the next several weeks.  He said that once those approvals are in place, they'll quickly get financing in place to ensure a February payment date--for everyone.  I said that was great news but that the market didn't seem quite as certain.  He was pretty firm.  He also said that it was too late for anyone to take them into bankruptcy involuntarily, that a judge wouldn't go for it. 

Did you know if Lay every talk to <NAME/>?

Best,

<NAME/>:  I faxed the examples that <NAME/> faxed us and that you and <NAME/> and I talked about some time back.  I'm sure that's how <NAME/> would calculate it.  Does it make sense to run the numbers and see what our "contribution" to <NAME/>'s undercollection would be under <NAME/>'s view?  If you need another copy, let me know.  Question:  I don't know what our book looks like on this issue, but if we were to take the "netting" through a reduction in the PX credit going forward, how much of a hit would that be, particularly if we were to get the $120 MM up front?

<NAME/>:

My CompareRite feature is not working right now, but I can point out the changes we made.  The changes we made were to the final revised form that <NAME/> St. <NAME/> prepared, so for the most part, the changes are the same as hers with these exceptions:

1.	Preamble - "<NAME/> Power Marketing, Inc." has been changed to "<NAME/> North America Corp., formerly known as <NAME/> Capital & Trade Resources Corp.".

2.	First "WHEREAS" paragraph - "WHEREAS, ....identified on Exhibits A and B hereto (whether one or more referred to herein collectively as the "Transactions"), under the ISDA Master Agreement dated May 14, 1998...;".

3.	Second "WHEREAS" paragraph - changed "a" to "an" before "Assignment Agreement dagted April 25, 2001".

4.	Paragraph 3 - changed "Consent and Assignment" to "Consent to Assignment".

5.	Paragraph 8 - "As of...that certain ISDA Master Agreement, dated as of June 16, 1992...".

6.	Signature Line changed from "<NAME/> Power Marketing, Inc." to "<NAME/> North America Corp., formerly known as <NAME/> Capital & Trade Resources Corp.".

7.	Added Exhibit A (Natural Gas Transactions) and Exhibit B (Basis Swaps).

If my CompareRite starts working, I'll try to send you a blacklined copy.

<NAME/>:

In connection with the upcoming <NAME/> Corp. Board Meeting, we have prepared, and attach for your review, resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts on behalf of <NAME/> Corp.  The current resolutions are outdated because certain of the offices no longer exist or have changed.  In addition, the interest rate and currency desk typically goes to <NAME/> Fastow when documents need to be signed or written or oral instructions need to be given to brokers.  <NAME/>'s title has changed and he has also asked that <NAME/> Glisan and <NAME/> DeSpain be authorized to sign documents and to give instructions in connection with these brokerage accounts.

The attached resolutions are substantially like the ones ENA has adopted in connection with the opening of brokerage accounts.  ENA also requires two officers to sign documents to open brokerage accounts, but allows only one officer to sign subsequent documentation and to give instructions to the brokers.

Would you please review the attached resolutions and advise if they are acceptable so that we can submit them to <NAME/> <NAME/>  by tomorrow, August 1.

Thanks for your assistance and, please let us know if you have any questions.

<NAME/>,

I reviewed your revised offer sheet.  I am OK with the effective income of $484K.  Her records show basically no other income ($75/month), so I subtracted $3,000 from your number.  The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on.  $484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI.  I spoke to <NAME/> Murnane this afternoon.  He feels this property would most likely warrant 7.5% and a 30 year amortization.  See the attached spreadsheets.

<NAME/>,

Late last week, I received a call from <NAME/> Kracraft, who does employment law at Dynegy.  She indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from Dynegy to <NAME/> or vice versa.  Of course, such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-all.  At a minimum, I would think that you and <NAME/> Lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions.  With that thought, I have asked <NAME/> O'Rourke's team to work on such a protocol.

In the meantime, <NAME/> mentioned that one person in <NAME/> Shapiro's group wants to go to Dynegy.  She understood that Shapiro had said it was ok.  Do you know about that?  If not, should you give <NAME/> a call about it?  I am concerned about the floodgate effect, so I believe we should proceed with extreme caution.

Let me know your thoughts on this.

This gets even better.  On Tuesday, April 3, I had our California prescheduler ask the ISO Day Ahead personnel why the COB S/N ATC had been decreased so much.  There reply was that the ATC is calculated by taking the TTC less Existing Transmission Contracts less FTRs less Capacity Benefit Margin.  Normally, and up until January 1 of this year, they haven't used a Capacity Benefit Margin when calculating ATC leaving the state.  So the amount of ATC they had at COB S/N is normally in the 700 to 800 MW range, rather than the 35 to 60 MW of ATC they are using now.

We asked what this Capacity Benefit Margin was, and they said it's not in their tariff, it's in the NERC Operating Manual.  I went to the NERC web site, and sure enough, Capacity Benefit Margin is a defined term.  It reads : "Capacity Benefit Margin is the amount of TTC reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet generation reliability requirements".

The ISO's use of this language is outrageous.  This is language to ensure that load has transmission access to remote generation.  I can see them using this argument with respect to COB N/S but no way COB S/N!!  In fact, one could very easily argue that they are VIOLATING this criteria.  If we have load in the Northwest, and have purchased generation in California, we should have access to available transmission.

We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:

<NAME/> Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power
<NAME/> <NAME/> for East Power
<NAME/> Storey for Gas 
<NAME/> Luce for Peoples and Global Net
<NAME/> Gaskill for Gas Fundys
<NAME/> Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
<NAME/> Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.

Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from <NAME/> who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.

I am assuming its zero at the moment.

The Assembly will attempt to pass its version of the <NAME/> MOU (SB 78) out of the Appropriations Committee today.
If and when that occurs, the Assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full Assembly today.
It will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today.
If and when the Assembly gets the bill out of the Assembly today, the bill will move over to the Senate, where the chances of passage are even more remote.
That said, <NAME/> is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature.

In September North American paper demand continued to fall. This is not positive news for the paper and pulp industry.  The following is what PPPC released:
North American printing/writing paper inventories dropped by about 6% from August to the end of September, but shipments, production, and demand stayed depressed from year-ago levels.
Total North American printing/writing production was down 11.0% in September compared with a year ago, to 2.091 million tonnes, PPPC reported. Total shipments were off 9.9% to 2.224 million tonnes. Total inventories decreased 133,000 tonnes from August to September to 2.145 million tonnes and were 313,000 tonnes or 12.7% lower than in September last year. The industry overall operating rate (shipments to capacity) in September was 84%, down from 88% in August and down from 96% a year ago. 
Uncoated free-sheet accounted for most of the inventory drop, according to September statistics released yesterday by the Pulp and Paper Products Council in Montreal. North American demand was down 10.2% in September to 1.038 million tonnes
Coated free-sheet (woodfree) demand was down 11.2% in September while coated groundwood (mechanical) papers demand was off 7.5%, PPPC reported.

I know that we are all under a lot of stress and I probably shouldn't send this note, but I just have to get this off my chest.  Have I done something to undermine your faith in me?  

- When I worked on due diligence matters, you asked me why was I working on due diligence
- When I prepared the demand letters you asked me why I was sending the demand letters
- And, today, despite the fact that we oversee the  day to day transactions, there is no mention of my group in the customer letter.

I wish someone would just fire me if I'm incompetent, because I live in a hell worse than being fired -- at least I'd have time for my family.

<NAME/>,  After reviewing the Mojave TPA, I contacted <NAME/> Pena with El Paso to discuss.  He agreed that Section 3.2(B) can be stricken.  He also agreed that the Sentence In Section & on Page 10 which reads "Text from here to the end of item 7 has been inserted by <NAME/> North America Corp." is a note which should be stricken.

Also for consistency sake, Section 3.2(B) in the main body of the agreement should not be stricken.  Exhibit A overrides this Section so the strike is not necessary in the main body of the Agreement.  

Lastly,  the full legal name "<NAME/> North America Corp." should be inserted in the agreement.

Sounds like a plan to me.  Make sure they've given her an actual seat assignment or she may show up at the airport and get bumped.

You might try these:

In Sedona:
  Enchantment Resort (I recommend hiking!, jeep tours, spa)

In Scottsdale/Phoenix:
  Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North (haven't been but it gets good reviews)
  The Phoenician (huge rooms, great spa, mother-of-pearl lined swimming pool)
  The Boulders (also highly rated)

At the Canyon
  El Tovar Hotel (reportedly the nicest hotel in the park, not necessarily up to Hayman standards but might work for a night)

In Tucson (pretty far from the Grand Canyon):
  The Lodge at Ventanna Canyon

The Property is restricted in that no activity using explosives or other high-power detonating devices may be conducted on the Property within 500 feet of the storage well facility of Vendor located near the Property that would fracture or cause subsurface movement to the storage well facility of Vendor.  Additionally, Buyer shall erect and maintain, at its sole cost and expense, a suitable chain-link fence between Vendor's retained adjacent property and the purchased Property.

Thanks for checking into it.  Coincidently, I noticed that there is a line on my phone called Portland #2 that noone uses.  If it's listed on the phone does that mean that it's necessarily there?

Please make the following revisions to the peak and off-peak position reports:

Remove ERCOT wind position completely from the report (PPA has been terminated)
Add ERCOT north zone positions
Add ERCOT south zone positions
Show separate positions for FL/GA border and FPL/FRCC
Add PJM-East positions (show separate from PJM-West)
Off-Peak position still shows SERC-FL (this location no longer exists) - Florida positions are either FL/GA or FPL/FRCC.

<NAME/>:

Attached is a draft confirm for a natural gas EFS under the new NYMEX rules.  Please review the redlined language.

The new NYMEX amendment permitting EFS transactions was originally part of a pilot program for <NAME/> Crude contracts (NYMEX Rule 6.21) effective September 5, 2001.

NYMEX Notice No. 01-372 effective November 1, 2001discusses the application of the EFS for natural gas futures contracts but I cannot find a specific reference to a NYMEX rule (I assume it is NYMEX Rule 6.21).  Thus, I didn't know whether it was necessary to cite a particular rule.

I also didn't know if I need to reference the number of NYMEX contracts in my "Special Provisions" section.

Further, if Rule 6.21 is applicable to the natural gas futures contracts, then I suppose that the confirm should (?) recite the information required of the Clearing Member by the Exchange.  On the other hand, maybe the Clearing Member's report should contain information such as appearing in Rule 6.21A(C), if applicable, and it need not be repeated in the confirmation.

Can you give this a quick review?  Trading in the nat gas contract terminates in a day or so.  Thanks.

I too am a little worried about the outcome on Saturday.  I am bringing two friends that are University of Texas Alums and am just hoping to show them a good time and what true tailgating is all about.

There will be including myself 7 adults and my 3 year old son.  Is that too many?  Please let me know.  Everyone is extremely exciting and my son is now to the age that he will really enjoy it.  Last year we always took him on game day to see the raptors and he was kind of interested, but now he really enjoys animals.  

Thanks again for all of your help arranging this trip.  Please also let me know again when the scholarship dinner is going to be held, I am sure some of my family would really enjoy attending.  Thanks see you at <NAME/>'s.

<NAME/>,  I forgot to mention in my earlier note, that for the parking/storage arrangement with Bay Gas, I would request their form of storage agreement.  I makes more sense to have a separate agreement cover the parking arrange as this is really independent of the compression services.

In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including <NAME/>--filed "Petitions for Rehearing."
The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions.
Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial.
In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects.
Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds.  
Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.
The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below.
If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact <NAME/> Alamo.

Best,
<NAME/>

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."  pp 20-21

FYI . . .

Below is written by our environmental consultant EEA

>>
Based on the preliminary emissions data for 2001 just 
released, the allowance surplus for this year is 23,189 tons 
bringing the total bank at the end of the year to 83,778 tons.  This 
would mean a flow control value of 0.26 or a discount factor of 0.63 
for 2002.  The exact flow control/discount values cannot be 
calculated right now because they will depend on how many 
banked allowances are used for compliance this year and also on 
the implementation of the Maryland consent decree which the state 
and EPA probably wont figure out until next year.  But we are 
pretty much in that range.

The hourly index is a must for me (the day-ahead index is unhedgable for us and we would give them free money for the next 10 years).   It is important to understand that under the new proposed structure, VEPCO will call on this energy many more days than they do now and it is very important that we create an index that we can hedge.  
I will not due this deal based on a day-ahead index - it must be hourly at the interface we defined.

Please clarify your call option vs. firm delivery comment.

The Bond Legislation
The Democrats in the Assembly and Sentate have agreed to language to create a Dedicated Rate Component to repay the budget and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts. 
But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along.  
The bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so Republican votes are necessary. 
The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along.

The Conference Committee
Senator <NAME/> does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal.
Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is uncertain.
No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place, though <NAME/> continues to say that he wants to "give it a chance."

The Core/Noncore Legislative Language
The negotiating group continues to work on the language.
The language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning.

Senator Dunn's Investigative Committee Hearing
The hearing's been moved from tomorrow to Wednesday.

<NAME/>, pls ensure that this meeting comes with a defined plan from legal for discussions related to capacity release ( purchase or sale ) at full tolls, discount or premium. In addition to this and most importantly what is ENA's legal position on the disclosure of commercial terms that accompany and structured transportation agreement. I.E. if we buy gas at a market based rate and assign capacity to the customer ( at full tolls ) are we going to be required to post the commercial terms to the street.

Pls review and advise if you need anything further.

Great question.  If you think it would be useful, I can back channel to <NAME/> and find out.  I'm of the view that this letter is more to refute Angelides, so that his wild assertions don't go unanswered in the court of public opinion.  Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides, instead.  

On the other hand, I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools, processes, etc. necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand, and ensure that there's not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other.  In the public's view this has been painted as an either/or issue. Either we end direct access, or granny faces death and destruction.  And that's just not the case. In fact, I think it can be argued that the scenario Angelides paints just isn't in the cards, period.  

But I may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views.  Let me know if you'd like me to find out if <NAME/> thinks the letter would help her. Could find that out in pretty short order.

Best,
<NAME/>

No formal agenda has been planned for our staff meeting today.  Instead, I would like for each of you to think of a question(s) or problem(s) that you have encountered while in the group.  These questions/problems can be something that you already know the answer to or have yet to receive the answer.  For those areas that you already know the answer, this would be a good time to share what you have been working on with the rest of the group and maybe stop everyone else from running into the same question/problem.  For those areas that you do not the answer, we will do our best to get that answered.  

In addition, if there is any additional detail that you would like to know regarding topics covered in the Risk Overview class, this would be a good time to ask since the class is fresh on your minds.

Thanks,

We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

I am stranded here in London and this morning on my way into the office had the pleasure of my cab driver noticing that I am an American and taking a minute to point out exactly what this commentator has said: that we are under appreciated the world round, that the <NAME/> Plan was a remarkable departure from the accepted norms concerning how conquered nations should be treated and wondering what other nation, if it had the kind of military and economic might available to us, could have resisted, as we have, using it to totally dominate its neighbors if not the world.

<NAME/> Sanchez submitted her resignation this afternoon. She is moving to Salt Lake City with her fianc? and will not be working in the industry.  I moved all of her positions to my book today.  We have cancelled her EOL trading rights and her stack manager ID.  She will be managing the Permian cash position on EOL for my book, much like <NAME/> and <NAME/> are doing right now.  We have asked her to stay until October 12 so that she may complete her SJ/PERM  production and work on west fundamentals.

With the cancellation of a number of Surety Bonds by our providers, we are faced with a potential credit crunch in NEPOOL.  

Also, it is my understanding (although I haven't seen anything) that our Nov 2001 bills are due in all of the markets on Dec 20, 2001.
 
<NAME/> and I are trying to work out our payment plans (if any) and other requirements to keep our books afloat.  

We need to have support on understanding any payment obligations (and bills if we have them) and issues (e.g., Annual Fees).  Who can we talk with for each market?

Sounds like you are as busy as I am.   Yes, my parents still live in the same house in Kennewick.   My Dad retired from teaching in WA (collecting WA retirement) and has been teaching in Hermiston, OR for the last 7 years.

Just to clarify, <NAME/>'s international business model and North American business model are quite different.   I work in the <NAME/> North American business unit which has been extremely profitable and has pioneered the deregulation of the natural gas and electricity markets in the US.   <NAME/> NA's focus has been on creating efficient wholesale markets in gas, power, crude, pulp & paper, metals, etc and then providing the market with a logistical delivery and price risk management intermediation function.   We are very cost effective in this function because we achieve huge scale and scope in the market with minimal fixed costs.

<NAME/>'s international business model, on the other hand, entailed constructing capital intensive infrastructure power and gas projects with leveraged project financing (with project financing supported by long term sales to government utilities).   This model is OK provided the business risk, currency risk, international risk, change in law risk, legal risk, etc. is priced properly by the debt and equity providers.

I will let you conclude which business model is better.   I think you will see <NAME/> applying our successful NA model into the international markets that have an economy and regulatory environment that supports a "free-market" model.

Later.

Sorry for the extremely late response.  Despite the fact that <NAME/> referred you, we would have interest in meeting with you about emplyment opps. I was planning on going to NY in a couple weeks but at this point, I don't know.  I would highly recommend that you follow the formal recruitment program in addition to any talks we have.  Although I can recommend to make you an offer, it is much easier if it is done in parallel with the associate recruitment program.  After the current events calm down, we can talk via phone about my experience here and why I think there are some good opportunities here.

ENA executed an "Assignment and Novation of Transactions" effective 9/1/01 as to certain derivative transactions appearing on the attached Exhibit A reflecting that the HESC position would be assumed by Energy Marketing, a division of Amerada Hess Corporation.  ENA was never provided with an executed version of this instrument by the two Hess parties.  The assignment does not state that the transactions will be subject to the ENA ISDA with Amerada Hess Corporation.

Amerada Hess Corporation terminated its ISDA with ENA on 12/3/01.

(1)  <NAME/>/<NAME/>:

	(i)  We need a copy of the fully executed assignment document.  Please forward to <NAME/>.
	(ii)  You need to verify that all outstanding transactions appear on the attached Exhibit A to that assignment.

(2)  <NAME/>:

When we receive the fully executed assignment document, we need to insert into the Amerada Hess Corporation file and conduct a contract review.  If all outstanding transactions were assigned, we need to note in the Hess Energy Services Company, LLC file that no further action is required in that file.

(3)  <NAME/>:

If all of the above occurs, then we will conclude that the invoices should actually be paid by Amerada Hess Corporation which has terminated.

Riordan edges out <NAME/> in Field Poll: A survey finds lingering damage from the governor's handling of the energy crisis.
By <NAME/> <NAME/>
Bee Political Editor
(Published Sept. 26, 2001) 
Gov. Gray <NAME/> survived the summer without the widespread power blackouts his opponents predicted, but voters remained dissatisfied with his job performance and disinclined to re-elect him, a Field Poll released Tuesday found. 
The poll showed <NAME/> narrowly behind in a trial general election matchup against former Los Angeles Mayor <NAME/> Riordan, 45 percent to 42 percent. 
Riordan's strength in Los Angeles County -- rare for a Republican candidate -- as well as lingering damage to <NAME/> from California's energy crisis were factors in the findings, said the poll's managing director, <NAME/> DiCamillo. 
"It's an interesting situation for a sitting governor," he said. "It's very unusual for a sitting governor to be denied re-election, but here we have a unique candidate coming out of a Democratic stronghold. And also we have this issue that is kind of hanging around the neck of the governor that the public is not very pleased about, and that's the energy and the electricity crisis." 
In a hypothetical Republican primary, Riordan led by a large margin over Secretary of State <NAME/> Jones, 46 percent to 19 percent. Businessman <NAME/> <NAME/> trailed with 5 percent of the vote, while 30 percent was undecided. 
The poll surveyed 1,003 Californians, including 722 registered voters, Sept. 7-10 and is subject to an overall error margin of 3.2 percent. 
<NAME/> political adviser <NAME/> South said reporting poll results taken before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast was "horribly misleading." 
"These kinds of watershed events that shake the national psyche always have an effect on job approval," he said. "These kinds of things have effects on the way people feel about incumbents in general." 
DiCamillo said he found it notable, however, that views of <NAME/>' performance continued to lag even as voters worried less about the electricity crisis. 
In May, at the peak of concern about potential power blackouts, voters said they disapproved of <NAME/>' performance, 49 percent to 42 percent. In the latest survey, they continued to disapprove, 47 percent to 41 percent. 
Voters also said they were not inclined to re-elect <NAME/>, 50 percent to 43 percent. 
"Now we're in a situation where the energy crisis mentality has receded, yet the public's image of the governor has not changed," DiCamillo said. "He has not benefited from the easing of public concern about the issue and is in the same situation that he found himself back in May. 
"No matter what the political temper of the times internationally, there will be issues that are particular to the governor's race. This issue is what the public has focused their attention on in evaluating <NAME/>, and it's still negative." 
DiCamillo said he also was struck by the fact that the poll found Riordan leading among voters in Los Angeles County, 47 percent to 43 percent. He said the survey showed similar results in May. Los Angeles County accounts for one-quarter of the state's electorate, and Democrats typically carry it and the Bay Area by large margins, making up for losses in virtually every other area of the state. 
Riordan adviser <NAME/> Schnur said the numbers pose a strategic difficulty for <NAME/>. 
"It's clear from this poll result that the voters who know <NAME/> Riordan best support him most," he said. "Unless Gray <NAME/> plans on winning the Bay Area by a voice vote, there's no way he can get re-elected unless he turns L.A. County around in a very big way." 
South said Riordan, who held a nonpartisan office in Los Angeles, will fare far differently in a statewide partisan contest. And he recalled that then-Gov. <NAME/> <NAME/> was trailing Democrat <NAME/> Brown by 23 points as he prepared in 1993 for re-election. 
"We all know how that turned out," he said. "A sitting California governor hasn't been defeated for a second term since 1942."

Only a week and a half to reply to you - I apologize!   The artickale was great.  In fact, today I have resent the notice with the hot link to my direct reports.  Since we all get so many e-mails, I wanted to be certain that this wasn't overlooked.  I pointed out to them that ENN had broadened its cover to include operations as well as technology, and that they should look for upcoming articles.

Good info.   Consistent with reports from McGowan.   I am now short 02 at $39/ton and long 03-04 at $32.50/ton.   Love the spread given my view of natty.

Since the report is almost identical to info I have received from McGowan, I don't see any pressing need to call <NAME/>.   You are certainly free to call him if you want.

<NAME/>,

I am meeting with <NAME/> <NAME/> this Wednesday to start working on price forecast.

I am currently working with <NAME/> on inventory forecast and the procedure is as follows:

Based on the formula (capacity * op. rate) - shipments = forecast inventory.

We used PPPC capacity forecast for the year and divided by 12 to get the monthly forecast. Then multiply this with our own estimate of the operating rate which can be an average of the last 2 months or the operating rate of last month carried forward, or the last month's operating rate difference with the average and apply that difference to calculate the next  month op. rate. 

We also estimate the level of shipments as the last 3 years average for the month we are trying to forecast.

So far we have only tested September and the forecast was pretty close to the actual.


let me know if this is what you requested,
Thanks,
<NAME/>

Attached is a spreadsheet summarizing hourly TTC and ATC data for COB S/N from Jan 1, 2000 to April 2001.  The data were obtained from the ISO.
After looking at the data, it is clear that, although the TTC values have not changed from '00 to '01, the ATC values have decreased dramatically.  I believe the reason for this is the ISO's attempt to prevent exports to the Northwest.

I propose that we send this spreadsheet to our ISO rep (via <NAME/> <NAME/>) and ask him to explain the reason for the reduction.

Yesterday, Riordan kicked things off in California.  He focused squarely on energy.  He made three key, and interesting points. 

The contracts <NAME/> signed are a huge mistake for California that must be fixed.

Zoya Raynes:  Has already been through Salomon's rotational program.  Her interest lean more towards

Looks good to me.  One remaining concern is that section (d) may not provide much protection.  According to the power trading lawyers who have worked with the FERC in the past, they never provide protection for what we would consider confidential commercial information even when they have the authority to do so.  If we want that kind of protection, it should be mandated, not made possible by regulatory action.  I'm not necessarily recommending a change, I just don't want anyone to be taking any comfort from section (d).

Big Pig:

Met with them today and gave an overview of Operations.  All went well.   The CFO asked about performance measurements regarding costs per transaction.  I described the Operations Pricing Model that I implemented several years ago.  They were also interested in our ability to handle increased transaction flow, and I mentioned that through the OPM we were able to track the increased operational efficiencies that we experienced with the increase in transaction flow.  The CFO asked to get some information regarding OPM.  I have a summary report that reflects the decrease in cost per transaction plotted against the increase in transaction counts.  This is not currently included in the data room.   Do you want to review this before I pass it along to <NAME/> Zipper to provide to the CFO?  


UBS:

Eddie Pittarelli (Head of Operations for UBS) called today to reconfirm the numbers of operations personnel slated for Newco.  The spreadsheets that you had forwarded to me <NAME/> (through <NAME/> Fitzpatrick on December 19) totaled 172 for Operations, which included 32 for Gas Logistics.  Eddie said that he was going into a meeting tonight where UBS would again discuss their level of interest.  He wanted to know if the Operations staff was still primarily in tact, and I confirmed that is the case.  Told him that the leads on Gas Risk, Gas Logistics, Power Risk, Settlements and Documentation were all here in place.  He said that depending on the outcome of the meeting tonight that he plans to be in <NAME/> within the next few days.  FYI.

<NAME/> --

Good job.

On the hourly market price index, until we have LMP dispatch, the best we can do is a public index.  Let's not ask for too much.  Just something we can hedge against.  Can you talk with the EWS folks for the best index option???

Also, if the default is a monthly public index, why do the customer's need any "parking"?  They can move directly to the new option.

What is your definition of "functioning wholesale market"?  Are we stating that unless an RTO is running, we can't get rid of the PPO?  Maybe just resolve the Imbalance issue.  More specifics would be helpful.

Thanks,

You are 100% correct.  That is my impression as well, and that is why I set up the Monday meeting.  Going forward, the format of those meetings should be:

	1) Richter presents his area of accountability (West wholesale prosition, risk systems, deal capture system, status of 	projects, schedule, etc.)
	2) Black presents his area of accountability (deal review, west tariff,  and gas)
	3) Herndon presents his area of accountability (East wholesale & East tariffs)
	4) <NAME/> presents his area of accountability (deal structuring, deal valuation, new model construction)
	5) Busby presents his area of accountability (risk systems and portfolio valuation - works with Richter)
	6) You and I find the holes and provide direction.

Your thoughts?

After talking to <NAME/> I have a new plan of attack for Schedule E's.  He informed me that the top-levels were typically put in at one region level per roll.  I had Zhiyun re-run the killed deals calc (post id 15667).  Everyone should go back into the rolls and put the top-levels into their correct regions also adjusting the Schedule E's.  This is why the differences are so large in certain areas and the only way we can start to pinpoint the problem is to find the problem spots.

I have also identified where the $4.6 MM difference for OPPD arose from.  Deal # 11678.04 has not been transferred into the East Bank book.  In addition, there are no volumes in this deals; however, if you look back to the official 11/30/2001 calc there are volumes for this deal.  It gets more bizarre than that because there were two deals that should have been transferred for OPPD (11678.4, and 564826.1).  Deal 564826.1 was transferred but the valuations are approximately $4MM different.  I have printed detail for deals 11678.4 and 564826.1 (they are in Casey's chair) as of the 11/30/2001 official calc.  I have also printed deal 564826.1 in the 11/30/2001 bankruptcy calc.  I noticed that I cannot see any swap detail reports for the bankruptcy calc.  Please re-calc and generate these reports as they will probably be important as we dig into details.

Other than <NAME/> who has to perform some IT testing, no one should be working (or playing) on anything other than trying to get these Schedule E's and top-levels figured out.  The task is actually very important as there will be many decisions made off of these numbers.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

I made it back to <NAME/> last night.  Incredible security at the airport in London -- it was a mob scene.  In addition to the usual stuff there was an additional search of all carry-ons by hand at the gate and all passengers were patted down by a guard before entering the gate.  I saw several passengers questioned on the plane about their checked luggage -- I couldn't really hear what it was all about.  We were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer.  The Brits were all very nice of course but it sure is good to be home.

10:30 (Dow Jones) The key to analyzing media stocks is....automobiles? Yes, it's true, suggest SG Cowen media analysts <NAME/> Hatch, <NAME/> Mirsky and <NAME/> Handler, in this week's Media Money Manager. Automobile advertising is the largest category in domestic consumer media spending and accounts for about 17%, or $15 billion, the stock studiers say, using data from Competitive Media Reporting. By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies "to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports." Such an event, says the SG Cowen crew, could mark a significant catalyst for companies that depend heavily on TV advertising, like AOL Time <NAME/> (AOL), Viacom (VIA, VIAB), News Corp. (NWS), and Disney (DIS). ( BS)

<NAME/> Nicolay and <NAME/> Novosel are the two best regulatory people.   In terms of pushing the timing, political clout is going to be more important which in the past would have come from Kean and Lay.   Obviously, that will not work anymore.   I have a good relationship with Larcamp (FERC head of Staff) and might be able to help with the politics.   I think FERC is going to want to hear directly from  the new owner.   If we want speed, I recommend we use the expertise of <NAME/> and <NAME/> combined with the overall political clout of the new owner.

You are not off base with Steffes at all.

There was a discussion today involving Home Depot and our inaction regarding not having sent out a DASR.

To make sure that we are all on the same page (please let me know if anyone disagrees with the following) --

1.	We (meaning EES broadly) do have customers with metered demand greater than 1 MW (otherwise known as non-Price to Beat).

2.	For non-Price to Beat customers that have not been DASRd or have no contract, the Affiliated REP will provide service to the customer beginning on their first meter reading after Jan 1, 2002 under a blanket Term of Service Agreement (let me know if you want copies) under the following price terms 
TXU Energy Services cost = $5 per kw for Demand (based on highest demand in last 12 months) + $50/Mwh + $100/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.  
Reliant Energy Services cost = [1.5 * Daily Gas Index * kwh] + [{1.15 * Capacity Price} * kw (billing demand)] + $490/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.

3.	If the customer does not pay their bill, they will then be placed on POLR service.

4.	The AREP offers month-to-month service with a 30 calendar day notice provision for cancellation.

5.	Next opportunity to DASR these customers will be Dec 16, 2001.

6.	When we find a buyer for the Texas book or all of the company, EES intends to obtain permission from the customer to assign the non-Price to Beat customers.  This implies that we will not be sending out the Opt-Out provision to non-Price to Beat customers.

<NAME/>:
Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., <NAME/> White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

Should you enter into a transaction with ConEd, and they haven't signed the amendment to the existing transaction, the new transaction may have to be unwound.

Thanks.  The key, of course, is to create a filing that could not be used against us at FERC on these issues.  I guess that amending the filing is better than withdrawing the filing and re-submitting.  My only thought would be that by withdrawing, PGE provides no trail.

I have been getting this question a lot!

It has been communicated to every employee that if they are in Category 5, they will get a PIP.  Therefore, I recommend putting one in place.  If you are more comfortable, you can re-name it to reflect goals and objectives for the next review period -- something like "Performance Objectives" or something to that effect. 

Because it has been communicated that everyone will get a plan, we really should follow through.

Guys,
      <NAME/> Fagan will be sending you a worksheet for year end bonuses for 2001 and a worksheet for 2002 merit increases.  Several individuals may not show up on your bonus list since employees who previously received retention bonuses have been omitted, but these individuals will show up on your merit list.  Please work through these lists and forward your suggestions to <NAME/> Fagan by December 28.  As guidelines:

       1. We MUST, in the aggregate, come in below the sum of the proposed bonus levels.
       2.  Individual bonuses which exceed last year's amounts will be strictly scrutinized at three levels (me, <NAME/>, and the Comp. Committee), so the story had better be good.
       3.  I'd like to see extraordinary performance during the past few months, particularly in a leadership capacity, heavily weighted in your consideration.

The time has finally come for us to mourn the loss of another one of our fallen brethren.  Yes <NAME/> Bass, my brother, will be getting married Feb. 2.  So, with that in mind it is time to set up the festivities for the bachelor party. 

The party will be Saturday, Jan. 19.  I was thinking about taking the gambling/drinking cruise out of Freeport (about 30 mins south of <NAME/>) called The Texas Treasure (www.txtreasure.com).  The cost should run about $50 a person for the cruise - drinks and "gourmet" dinner included or $35/person for drinks and buffet dinner.  Let me know which one you would prefer.  I personally prefer the better dinner.  Gambling expenses are not included in the above calculations.

The cruise sails from 7PM - 1AM.

Let me know if you can make it and, if so, what choice of dinner you would like ASAP so I can make arrangements.

If I were you, I would talk to <NAME/> and let her know that <NAME/> is the point person as it relates to currently handling this matter and that we will trust that she will keep him fully informed and involved.  We are glad that she is there to provide some continuity on historical data, but all historical data and forward actions must be confirmed with <NAME/>.  Let me know if you would like me to underscore this with <NAME/>, and I will be glad to.  Might be a good idea to send a note to <NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/> stating that legal has named <NAME/> as the point person, but that for appropriate continuity and execution that <NAME/> must be fully involved - and that you have asked <NAME/> to make that part of her responsibility.  Copy <NAME/> on the note.  --<NAME/>

<NAME/> has given us until noon Wednesday to get them the final list of EOL products and book mappings.  I know with the trader changes last Friday these will change again.  
The traders had a meeting this morning going over their curves, and it sounds like they are moving some curves between regions and might possibly be losing some locations.  Since we will be testing everything on Thursday, we need to have our curve files ready to load on Wednesday to give a prior day curve for portcalc.  
The west traders are looking at theirs now, can you guys check with your traders and see if they need any changes made to the files, and let them change any links?

We also need to create a curve file that the traders can get to, but doesn't give them access to any of our other files, so the current location will not be the final.  We can create this tomorrow once we have converted over to UBS.

Hey there!

How's it going?  I understand you guys stole one of our marketers.  That's ok, I'll forgive you.  Things are insanely boring here.  Basically we are in a wait mode, probably, I think, until February.  This is the first time in 5 years I haven't had to worry about P&L and I have to say it's pretty weird.  It's nice sleeping in though.

So supposedly we have 14 potential suitors. You've probably heard of the banks, and I've also heard Reliant is putting together a bid.  THAT would be interesting.  We laid off probably half the people in our office--pretty much all back office support and some conservation/renewable people.  Bad timing.  Plus, when we laid off <NAME/> Broadband folks, they got a six month severance package, and EBB didn't make any money, and in fact lost a substantial amount.  Then <NAME/> lays off people on our floor, which has made a phenomenal amount of money, and gives them basically $4,000 taxed at 48%.  Life is not fair.

It's going to be interesting to see what this does to the industry.  I think the California debacle, then <NAME/> (now Calpine), is going to create an interesting dynamic going forward.  Credit is going to become more and more an issue, especially towards the back of the curve.  It's interesting, I remember 5 years ago the prediction was, when it was all said and done, there would be 6 big energy suppliers in the country.  Looks like it's heading that way.

So are you going to Europe?  Sounds like fun.  If it looks like we're going to be on the sidelines for a while, I might go on vacation for a couple of weeks, maybe Hawaii.

Well, I'm going to go grab a cup of coffee.  I hope everything is well with you.

Take care,

<NAME/>

Hello you guys,
 
Well I hope you have Dad doing some of the cleaning!  You know how he always has an opinion but yet no participation.  Anyway I hope you're doing fine.  I'm fine and about to depart to Dallas TX for the weekend.  I'm meeting some of my old military friends for a big party this weekend.  I'm really looking forward to this party, it's due to a college football game (Oklahoma University vs the University of Texas) and has been going on for about six years now.  The guy throwing the party is working hard to make it a tradition and so far he has done a very good job.  The party gets bigger every year and I think this year will be the biggest.  There are people flying in from all over the country.  Flying now after everything that has happened isn't scary to me but now the waiting period for both check in and security has increased substantially.  It's a big pain but obliviously needed.  I'll talk to you guys soon.  Go UT!

Thank you for your kind words about our country and our people.  The horrific nature of this brutal crime still smolders in the ashes of the World Trade Center and yet the sight of Palestinians dancing in the streets or reading in Saturday's paper the stunning words from the Greeks of all people that we had somehow brought this upon ourselves.  Their country would be marching to the strains of "Heil Hitler" if we had not brought our military and economic might in to save Europe from its despots.

<NAME/>,
      All I really wanted to ensure is that we were striving to get as many tickets as we could, since the employees would take as many as we could get.  I was concerned that with all of the cost cutting, someone would just assume that we could get by without the tickets.  I thought that Deb could get eight (8), I'd buy them personally, and I'd use four (Hayes and me), and would give the other four to employees.  If <NAME/> <NAME/> wants four (4), that's fine.  Let Deb know, however, that employees using them for personal use (which I'm sure will be all of them), will be expected to pay for them themselves.

Foex is up again for the third week in a row even though the increase was at a slower rate than last week . The increase seems to continue to be the result of price increases announced by pulp producers earlier this month.

Today NBSK came in at $463.94/mton up $5.05 (1.10%) and BHKP was Euro 461.76 up Euro 8.78. Expressed in dollars BHKP was $416.72 up $1.24 (0.3%).

You are right.   They are on crack.   This would be at least $3.50/Mwh over Cin.   They have gas deliverability issues in the winter and there alternative fuel is No. 2 oil.   Therefore, CPL East is a big premium Nov-Mar.   The bid/offer for this location is large due to transmission risk.

Hello favorite Aunt (and I do have more than one),

How much do you want to try to sell the cabinets (dolls and TV) for?  Or a least how much did you pay so that we can get a reasonable price.  My plan was to sell everything I own before moving....sound familiar?  

Anyway I hope everything is going well and have a good time on your Alaskan safari.

<NAME/>,  I reviewed the contract files on the Hubbard Transaction and found the following agreements:

All these contracts are in <NAME/> North America Corp.'s name

1.  Compression Services Agreement dated June 29, 2000 (I worked on this one.  We basically restated the existing Compression Services Agreement with NNG to revise conversion factors to allow NNG to deliver ENA more gas and thus allow ENA to mark more earnings.  NNG was able to book $2 mil of these earning as a fee paid by ENA to NNG in consideration for termination of the existing Compression Services Agreement)  This agreement has a provision for submission of a purchase offer by NNG to ENA for purchase of the motor and interconnection facilities.  No specific numbers are listed and the terms would have to be mutually agreeable.

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).  Thus it is not terminated.  If ENA fails to provide HP there are LD payments due up to a maximum of $200,000 per contract year.  Term is through January 31, 2018.

2.  First Amended and Restated Operations Agreement dated November 1, 1997.  NNG operates the electric driver for ENA.  Fee is $44,000 per year with an escalater.  Term is through November 30, 2017 (This works with the term of the CSA above.  Even though physical operations stop in November, gas still flows for another two month period).  

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 

3.  Agreement for Purchase of Power dated March 31, 1995 as amended on November 19, 1997.  ENA purchases electricity from Midland Power Cooperative.  Term is through December 31, 2017.

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 

4.  Master Lease Agreement dated March 31, 1995.  ENA leases the electric motor driver and appurtenant equipment from General Electric Capital Corporation. This agreement has a 10 year term with an option to purchase the equipment after year 8 for a fixed amount of $944,875.69.

	Bankruptcy of ENA is an event of default.  GE must provide notice that they wish to declare an event of default.  If they declare an event of default, GE could enter the premises and take possession of the equipment and hold ENA liable for the "Stipulated Loss Value" of the equipment and all rentals due thereunder.  The Stipulated Loss Value calculated is set forth on a Table attached to the agreement.

Let me know if you would like copies of any of these agreements.

Hi <NAME/>,

I hope all is going well.  The reason for my note is that I was wondered if you can still do the occasional currency swap for employee's.  I'd like to convert C$300-400 thousand and was wondering if I could pay the <NAME/> fee rather than retail.

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Worldwide chemical paper-grade market pulp producer inventories declined 66,000 tonnes in August from the prior month, according to preliminary data from the Pulp and Paper Products Council in Montreal. August marked the sixth month in a row that world inventories had fallen as producers dropped their stocks 1.9 percent from opening levels. 
World producer stocks closed August at 3.402 million tonnes, representing 37 days of supply, a day less than July results. Producer inventory levels are 33.3 percent higher than year-ago figures, when world producers held 28 days of supply. Although stocks are still high on a year-over-year basis, recent results still represented a strong improvement. Back in June, world producer stocks were 74.8 percent higher than the same period last year. 
August production of 2.683 million tonnes declined 2.3 percent from last month and tumbled 10.3 percent vs. year-ago results of 2.992 million tonnes. Global shipments totaled 2.750 million tonnes, dipping 1.9 percent from the 2.698 million tonnes recorded in August of last year. 
Producers operated at 88 percent of capacity in August, the same rate as both June and July of this year. That compared to world producers' year-ago operating rate of 103 percent. Meanwhile, the shipment-to-capacity ratio, considered an indicator of producer discipline, advanced 2 points from the prior month to 90 percent, PPPC reported. 
World inventory figures include totals from North America, Nordic countries, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, France, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, and Swaziland. Countries that do not report inventories include Russia, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Thailand. 
World producers shifted 26,000 tonnes between the close of July and last month's opening inventories.

Getting alot of inquiries.

The PUC has not yet voted on suspension of DA or related matters.
Likely to get to those items on the agenda within the next 30-60 minutes.
Looks as if the decision will 1) suspend DA beginning Sept. 20th and 2) include contract renewal in the suspension.  
In addition, it appears that the proposal would give the Commission some latitude to enact retroactivity back to July 1 if deemed necessary (this is unclear and we're trying to get more details on this provision).
Three key senators have sent a a letter to the PUC asking the PUC to provide recommendations to the Legislature on the conditions under which DA should be re-instated (since the letter is dated September 18th--though sent only yesterday--it appears that the Senate had an idea that the PUC was going to suspend).

KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DECISION HAS NOT BEEN VOTED ON YET AND THE PROVISIONS LISTED ABOVE MAY CHANGE.

We'll report back as soon as something happens.

For folks who want to listen in, the number is:

415.228.4550
code = 92105

<NAME/>,

I haven't had an opportunity to call you directly yet, so I thought I would e-mail you first and sort of lay out the circumstances.

I've been a short-term trader with <NAME/> for about 4 years -- I run our short-term Northwest book.  Prior to that, I cash traded for Portland General for a couple of years.  My contract with <NAME/> is up July 31, and I have a 3-month non-compete obligation.  Theoretically, the earliest I could leave <NAME/> would be May 31, so the earliest I could start with another shop would be Sept 1.

To be honest, at this point I'm shopping.  I'm talking to a couple of other outfits and I basically want to see what sort of interest there is out there.  I talked with <NAME/>, and he mentioned you, so I thought it might be a good idea to get in touch.  If you are interested in pursuing anything further, please e-mail me and we'll arrange a time we can talk over the phone.

Thanks,

<NAME/>:  the decision we talked about yesterday is to cover DWR costs for the period Jan. '01-Dec' 02.  Recall that SDG&E did not get the rate increases that PG&E and <NAME/> got.  The charge (I believe) is $14.6/Mwh on a system ave. basis.  If there's anything else you need, let me know.  This decision does not deal with the "undercollection" SDG&E has accrued due to the price cap put in place by previous Legislation.

<NAME/> --

Not quite sure that I am getting the picture.  Let me lay it out more directly.

The PX Credit for October 2000 was $225 based on the actual market rates.

Now FERC is saying that October 2000 hourly prices for CalPX DA and CalPX HA markets were "too high" in June 2001.  Can the CPUC change the PX Credit for October 2000 and make the Utilities recalculate our Negative CTC?

What is prospective?  Have they ever done this before?

Here's the proposal:

There is NO reason for the PUC to suspend DA since 1) 18XX passed--therefore the bonds are taken care of; all <NAME/> has to do is sign the bill, 2) Angelides has said that money's not an issue, at least for the next several months, and 3) the Senate passed a resolution on Friday night stating that there is no reason to continue the "state of emergency" put in place by <NAME/> on Jan. 17 and that the state of emergency should therefore end.
The PUC should therefore keep DA intact and begin putting the ratemaking in place to enable DA, while achieving other important objectives (e.g., no cost-shifting, make sure bonds get serviced, etc.)
If, however, the PUC rejects this rational, sensible proposal and decides to suspend DA, then that date must not be any earlier than Sept. 20th; and if it is, we will sue.

Thoughts?

Best,
<NAME/>

With respect to the PPA reserve.

We need to adjust the USD reserved based on the currency.  We decided not to hedge the currency when we took the reserve.  Its hard to make an objective decision on whether this is correct or not.  However, the currency was 1.5 CAD to 1 USD when we did it and now 1.565 CAD to 1 USD so the reserve would be 287.5 USD not 300.  We should just adjust this weekly or monthly.

Sorry but I don't have an isolated power plant capex number. 

In the NNG commercial folks original budget they forcasted $1.2 M revenue growth from $25 million 2002 Capital.  So my thought is that if you have already included maintenance capital = depreciation, then $25 million capital includes market area expansion as well as power plant growth.

<NAME/>:

Per our conversation, attached is a short "recap" of the companies and amounts involved.

With respect to prime brokerage accounts, the following approximate cash balances are held by Bear Stearns & Co. ("Bear") in accounts for the following companies:

<NAME/> North America Corp.	$159,022		[filing debtor]

ECT Investments, Inc.		$3,923,970.84		[has not filed]

<NAME/> Credit Inc.		$10,500,000		[has not filed]

I understand that one of our U.K. companies, <NAME/> Credit Limited, has been in touch with one of your employees with respect to the return of the <NAME/> Credit Inc. cash and was told that Bear wished to offset that amount against the amount owed by <NAME/> Credit Limited to Bear under OTC trades, approx. $1,500,000, for a net balance of approx. $9,000,000.

ECT Investments Inc. sent a demand letter to you via facsimile on November 30, 2001 requesting return of its cash balance.  I do not believe that ECT Investments, Inc.has any OTC trades with Bear but I will need to verify.

We would like to resolve the return of cash issues.  Please feel free to contact me.

Thanks for your assistance.

For the 25th presentation, I need the following:

A pictorial description of power generation sources:	1) Nuclear
							2) Coal
							3) Resid Steam Unit
							3) Gas Combined Cycle
							4) Gas Simple Cycle
							5) Hydro

I would like to show annual demand by customer segment (residential, commercial, industrial) for the East, West, and ERCOT and supply by generation type for the same major areas.   A table which shows Mwh consumption by demand segment and generation supply by source would be useful.   In addition, total capability by supply source

Some of this same info can be used for the 30th presentaiton.

<NAME/> -

Can you coordinate with <NAME/> <NAME/> at 503-464-8860 on how to change the filing (if at all) on PGE's pipeline issue?  PGE is willing to modify the filing to try and take out the language on Native Load.  They are suggesting that maybe they should sign a contract for the full amount of the capacity (about 170,000 mmcf/d) rather than assume its right.

The goal should be to have a final decision on next steps before next Friday, Aug 17.

Please call me with any questions.

<NAME/> , 

What I was remembering was the front months exposures we had at EDF MAN.
	Prior to moves                After
DEC	-2,003			 1,967
JAN	10,502			-1,588
FEB	 1,338			   552
MAR	-7,013			   188
APR	 5,831			     33

the over all position before the move was 1,240 and as of yesterday it is 4,205.

Let me know what the concerns are at EDF MAN and the request that they are making.
We can shift some positions around if the have levels by months that they want us to stay under.

I said on this AM's call that today is the deadline for <NAME/> to sign or veto bills.
That was not entirely correct.
That deadline applies only to so-called "regular session" bills.
The bill in question (SB18XX--<NAME/>) was passed as part of the Legislature's "emergency," or "special," session.
Apparently, "emergency session" bills do not fall under the October 15th deadline.
<NAME/> has nonetheless said he intends to veto the bill, though the pressure to renegotiate the contracts is increasing from all sides.
We'll report back on signing deadlines for bills passed on as part of the "emergency" session.
Bottom line: Today's deadline for regular session bills does not apply to SB18xx, or to other emergency session bills.

Our current plan on EA Operations would be to eliminate any planned headcount addtions and to reduce the current staff levels by 10%.  I will get with you on Tuesday morning to review the names, but I feel confident that few if any would be recognized by your commerical guys, as we only engage our best in interfacing with the traders.  Our current estimate on cost reductions for EA Operations is less than the $5.4MM estimated 2 weeks ago.  

<NAME/> Perlman and team are continuing to work tonight and will have details available tomorrow.   We are in agreement, as <NAME/> Hall has worked with <NAME/>'s team to eliminate 4 main projects on the production support systems (MKM Enhancements, Unify Production Tuning, Decaf Strategic Rewrite, and one other that escapes me at the moment).  <NAME/> and her team are also working on the cost savings that will result from potentially halting or slowing down other commercially-driven IT projects.  The headcount impact and dollar savings from these project eliminations are what <NAME/>'s team is focused on tonight.

I have reviewed the Dow Agreement wrt to the Dow Invoice Dated November 29, 2001 and have found the following

1.  2Q Lease Fee - $115,000
    3Q Lease Fee - $195,500.

Section 3.3 of the Agreement (as amended) provides for a lease fee of $25,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF until the date that gas injections begin in <NAME/>'s well (which was July 31, 2001) and a fee of $50,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF thereafter.  The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.  The above fees look to be OK.

2.  Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40
     Final Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75)

Section 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from <NAME/>'s new well and a corresponding credit back to <NAME/> for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from <NAME/>.  The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from <NAME/>'s new well.  Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.

3.  Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500

I find no basis for this in the contract.


Under Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.  So Bridgeline should be paying these costs, assuming they haven't already paid up to $1,000,000.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General <NAME/> Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 
The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies
We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said <NAME/> Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, <NAME/> Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by <NAME/> during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the <NAME/> contract was signed. 
"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the <NAME/> contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." 
The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. 
The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San <NAME/> Chronicle reported Monday. 
The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. 
CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance <NAME/> LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp. (CPN <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=CPN>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=CPN>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=CPN>), according to the report. 
Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.

This will confirm that the meetings with Weil for Sat and Sun will begin at 10am. <NAME/> wants the entire team to be present for the Sat meeting. We will decide after that meeting who needs to be present on Sun. I have sent Weil a number of materials, including the 3rd quarter results given to the analysts. We anticipate that Sat will be a lawyers only meeting to discuss the corporate structure and the bankruptcy issues related to the different business units. The meeting will probably last 4-5 hours.
 
The Sun meeting will include the commercial team. An agenda will be prepared, but most of the day will be devoted to information gathering and brainstorming.

During the merger, transactions between a regulated company of one of the partners (IP / PGE) should not do business with the other.  
 
If EES or EPMI is buying or selling from IP, please let me know.  Also, if we are delivering to retail load behind the IP market, we may need to make sure that our actions are with the code of conduct.  I don't think that we have to worry much with PGE side because EPMI and EES are already acting within the code of conduct.

Call me.  <NAME/> MW LLC will be treated like any third party.  Since we do not have our trading order, there are no unwinds or terminations and we do not have special preference for dealing with affiliates.  If this is in the money to ENA, we may be able to expedite the process but we are still dealing with a debtor.  I'm not sure that the relationship to ENA bears different treatment.

We need an immediate legal review to see what are on-going $ risks are in ERCOT.   The deficiency of $6500 is no big deal when they allocate to all of the QSE's on a pro-rata basis, however what if the deficiency is $100 million and we our pro-rata share is $3 million?

Do we have any legal recourse?   Do they suspend the deficient QSE immediately?

I am happy for us to paper the deal.  I am not sure that we will be able to guarantee anything special for Scarth in the event of a purchase of the assets -- it will be a deal team decision as to whether they want to impose that requirement on the sale of the asset.  <NAME/>

<NAME/>, <NAME/> and I met with the Estate this morning and Canada did come up in terms of the Transistional Services agreement.  Could you let us see Kyle's request and we'll try and help from this end.  How many people is he asking for to be seconded to the Estate.  I am concerned over IT requirements as we never developed this software in the first place - it was created by Razorfish.

In terms of 5, the person dealing with this is actually Per Dyrvik who is going to set up a conference call for us this morning.

As I told <NAME/> this morning, we have similar issues with Var in the East.   The correlations between gas & power for the entire curve are based on the front month and the correlations between regions are also based on the front month.

Good News!!!  The termination spreadsheets have been updated.  There are three new counterparties for physical and one new counterparty for financial.  <NAME/> Smith has moved a new version of Deal Liquidation into stage for us to use going forward.  It incorporates both his script for moving deals to Bankruptcy books and splitting deals on their termination dates.  Please look at this so we can use it on our updates.

We would prefer physical rights that we can take day-ahead and/or real-time (5 minutes ahead, if possible).   Rather than an obligation (like FTR's), we prefer an option (spread on pricing that can only be positive when exercised).
 
I would want to condition the transaction on having one RTO in the NE with LMP pricing in effect for the entirie NE market on or before 1/1/2003.   Assuming we get over those hurdles, this would likely be viewed as a capital project internally (fixed cost structure), therefore, we need to earn a minimum of 25% expected return (after credit).
 
Obviously, there is a huge unknown on the CT vs. Long Island forward curve with the changing market conditions.   This makes pricing this deal extremely difficult, particulary with the returns we would need to show.
 
Call me with any additional questions.

This is the latest on our status of calculating and reporting the DPR.  <NAME/> Buy, our chief risk officer, asked that we get back to normal as soon as possible.

I understand your point on this and agree that someone may try to argue that it is due to them upon signing the offer letter.  Our practice and intent has been to pay after they start, and I believe that the letter refers to payment after they start, so there is some wiggle room on the other side.

I agree that it is not a "slam dunk" on our part, but my view is that the risk is worth not doing anything unless and until we get some sort of demand or claim.  We then can cross the bridge as to how to proceed.  In the meantime, I am comfortable with this level of risk.

Of course, if these folks are ones to whom we are paying any money, then the waiver should address the signing bonus issue.

Ya'll let me know if you disagree.

Broadband Networking News  <NAME/> Holmes 03/27/2001  <NAME/> Hits Back Quickly After Blockbuster Failure <NAME/>-based energy and communications conglomerate <NAME/>'s <NAME/> Broadband Services unit signed a deal with Electronics Boutique earlier this month to deliver video games on demand in a bid to boost content offerings to its broadband customers as part of its entertain-on-demand (EOD) service.  Under the terms of the March 19 deal, Electronics Boutique subsidiary EBWorld.com will stream leading games for rental to <NAME/> 's broadband customers. The deal is a positive development for <NAME/> after the collapse of a deal with Blockbuster, which the companies announced March 9, that would have given <NAME/> exclusive rights to deliver movies for a video-on-demand service.   "The exclusive relationship has not yielded the quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting new on-demand service," explains <NAME/> D. Rice, president and CEO of <NAME/> Broadband Services.  "The Blockbuster announcement was disappointing, but I do think the technology and systems to be able to do that are virtually complete," notes <NAME/> Yannello, a utilities equity analyst at UBS Warburg. "I do think they will be able to potentially a deliver a variety of items to end-users. I would guess they need to do some more deals, driving traffic on [to] their systems. I think they can bounce back pretty quickly from the Blockbuster deal. I think the blow was more psychological and I would suggest it was used as an excuse for some others to lower some very aggressive price targets on the company, which is what they did."  The failure of the Blockbuster deal was a blow for the company as the exclusive 20-year agreement could have given <NAME/> significant upside in the content delivery business.   "I don't see Blockbuster as being a broadband killer for <NAME/> ," <NAME/> Christensen, a utilities equity analyst at First Albany Corp., tells Broadband Networking News. "I think they will probably [get] one or two anchor tenants before the year is out. I am optimistic."  The deal with Electronics Boutique and the failure of the deal with Blockbuster emphasize the importance <NAME/> is placing on securing content for its broadband network. Yet its main revenues from the telecom arena will continue to be derived from its bandwidth intermediation business, which uses pooling points to provide the physical interconnectivity between bandwidth buyers and sellers, allowing users to provide bandwidth on demand. This is <NAME/> 's core telecom business.  The content deals, while important, are not being factored into most analysts' forecasts on the company.   "I am confident that the content delivery business will be successful," says <NAME/> Niles, a utilities equity analyst at Salomon Smith <NAME/>. "The fact of the matter is they did get another deal. It was not as large as the Blockbuster deal, but they did get another one in there. We are not putting numbers in our model and our earnings forecast for content delivery. Whether it is very successful or not very successful, in our forecasts, we are not assuming any particular forecast for the content delivery business. I think bandwidth intermediation is their competitive advantage."  "The reality is that no one had any earnings (from Blockbuster) in the company projections for several years at best," Yannello adds. "It was a big name and was portrayed to be the killer app. It is disappointing, but I do think they will be able to bounce back with other deals. I also think in an early sense this gaming announcement is probably the tip of the iceberg of what they will be able to bring in."  <NAME/>, which produced revenues of over $101 billion in 2000 from its various businesses, is still rated highly by analysts, despite the failure of the Blockbuster deal.   "We have a $100 target price and a 'strong buy' rating," Yannello says. "That assumes roughly $75 of value for their energy business and $25 of value for their broadband services division. I think given what has happened in the broader market in the telecom arena, and given that the Blockbuster deal has falling apart, I think we be will waiting a while before we expand that $25 telecom valuation."

The state treasurer sent a letter this afternoon to <NAME/> Lynch.
The treasurer claims in the letter that, by extending DA  through Sept. 20th, the PUC could have shifted more than $8 billion to small customers.
He urges Lynch to immediately roll back the date to July 1.
We have started working with large customers to refute the letter.
If you would like a copy of the letter, please send your fax number to <NAME/> Alamo.

Here is lakeside in your format.  Looks like 11% cash on cash plus whatever principal is paid on the note.  My biggest concern is that actual vacancies and concessions have been higher than in the pro forma used to underwrite the offering.  Also expenses were higher.  Why would we be able to do any better than the existing management?

 

I would like to come see it again on Wednesday.  I would be bringing 1 or 2 others.  Could we see it in the morning around 9:30 or 10 am?

Does the gas desk keep the demand charge?  Also, we need to discuss-if you forget tocall.   If you forget to call, the price between the gas and power desk needs to be negotiated. Probably not a big deal in the summer but is a huge del in the winter with daily balancing.   Also, the gas desk will not be responsible for any imbalance penalties if you forget tocall.  If you forget tocall in the winter under daily balancing,  your desk will be charged my cost.   Otherwise, I think it's a go.

Economics:  Pioneer has offered $2mm for pipe that has a current book value of $533,000.  Replacement value of the pipe is roughly $26.8mm.

Potential Buyers: Sid Richardson has previously expressed an interest in the lateral.  Other area gathering companies include <NAME/>, El Paso, and Western Gas Resources.  I've contacted <NAME/> Watson about getting Richardson engaged.  I'll use the TW marketing Team to make contacts at the other companies.  

Pioneer has executed the confidentiality agreement.  I'm in the process of assembling easement and maintenance records.

If you'd like to get together this week and go through a process analysis for this transaction, let me know when would be a good time.

Yes, I would like to talk to you.  I think it will make sense to have an analyst in some capacity.  I didn't realize that you would making this decision so soon.  Maybe we can talk after bidweek (early next week).  If that timing does not work let me know.  I am still not sure if or when Lavorato is going to give me a Trading Track analyst/associate.

Attached is the latest pricing as of Friday's close for the Stagecoach deal.  Load factors have been adjusted per your request to give a 50% minimum.
The new indicative price, applying spreads from previous quotes, is now $4.82.   (Note that the market is off significantly today so this quote will likely be a few pennies higher than one you would get in the live market right now)

Thanks,

<NAME/>,

I have already spoken to the RIV and Canada Customs. My car was manufactured in Japan and thus would be subject to an import duty of 6.1%, the GST and excise and import costs.

Purchase price = 35000 USD = 54000 CND
Duty on this amount = 3300
GST on this amount = 3800
Excise tax = 180
Permits = 400

Plus costs to convert the speedometer and odometer to the metric system and label all safety systems with french language instructions (from RIV) = approx. 500

That brings us to $8200 CND plus the cost to actually transport it from <NAME/> to Calgary (at least $2000). Total approximately $10000 CND.

Hardly seems like the best option.

Also, I called <NAME/> moving to find out what the cost was to move me down here last year. And the invoice just for the move of my household goods from Calgary to <NAME/> was $4700 USD. Just off the top of my head my out of pocket costs will be:

Movers = $7300 CND (4700 USD)
Flight = $1500 CND
Hotel = $1500 CND
October Rent = $1500 (I have a 1 year lease in <NAME/> that expires at the end of October)

The total of the above is $11 800.

As mentioned in our floor meeting recently, attached are listings of teams that we are forming to better address the business needs of <NAME/> as it expands both in volume and scope. Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adjusted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but others will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be multidimensional. There will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is responsible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC group that you are in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process for consideration.

-	The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework.
-	Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened awareness of RAC issues. "De-silo-ization" .
-	All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment.
-	Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude among the teams.
-	Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect.
- 	Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions will require more frequent informal meetings.
-	There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of credit, market risk or our portfolio.
-	All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offer to help out if needed.
-	If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen.
-	Encourage weak links in team to perform.
-	Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement.
-	If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it with your supervisor.
-	Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC and compensation processes.

The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a catalyst to the recent reorganization there. You can have an impact.

This process should begin immediately. 

Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort.

I faxed those to you.  Can you please make the changes to the "Receipt of Payment".  I can change and initial the small change on the settlement agreement or if you email the document I will change it on the computer.

It would be easier if you could email me the documents so I can print out originals here.

<NAME/>:
<NAME/>:

I wanted to give you the benefit of some of my thoughts before I considered your Annex A which I would like to compare to the ENA current version.  We are currently considering more revisions so your Annex A will help me to think a bit.

I have attached a redline of the actual confirm (without Annex A).  A couple of thoughts:
(1)	for purposes of creating a "template", I gave a choice for Termination Date
(2)	I collapsed Payment Date/Invoice because I'm concerned that EJC may forget to send a timely invoice so we need to ensure that there is no issue about whether or not a payment is owed
(3)	We need to "fix" the Floating Price language.  I don't know where the reference to "North Sea, West Africa, Mediterranean" comes from.  I didn't see it in Marketwire and London doesn't use it.  Also, the conversion language is vague (i.e., TTM, TTB and TTS are not defined but I suspect they refer to bid/mid/sell?  Are they references on the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. screen?).  Also, it may be better to create a conversion reference to your Central Bank and not a particular banking institution (you could get caught later dealing with that bank, using the conversion language and then giving the bank an unfair advantage).
(4)	I didn't see your Schedule 1 guarantee but I assume that it is the normal ENE format. 

Regarding Annex A, I quickly noticed an issue with the "TIBOR" definition (which uses quite a bit of ISDA language) which can be easily fixed with an appropriate ISDA reference.  Give me another day or so to comment.

Let me know if you'd like to talk.  My home number is 713-664-3207 if you'd like to call.

Regards.  <NAME/>

<NAME/>,

I base my opinion on 15 years trading and marketing risk management products to corporations. When I was at Bankers Trust, every corporation we dealt with would ask after completing a deal "can you tell us where we can get a cheap off-the-shelf system that we can use to manage these things ? "

The problem KioDex has is exactly what you describe: with companies that where trading of derivative products is core to their mission, the third party ASP model is an extremely difficult one to sell. There are all the obvious reasons: security, reliability, continuity etc... What Kiodex needs to focus on, in my opinion, is the intersection of customers who need the product but don't view the function as critical to their operation.

For what it is worth.

<NAME/> --

Before we do anything on this issue, I would suggest that we need to have developed a strategy on a number of issues (primarily the proper reformation of the PX Credit calculation after Jan 18 and the application of the 1c/kwh surcharge).

On this issue, assuming that we haven't discuss the failure of SCE to apply our account's past credit with the CPUC (given that the bills were just received), I can't imagine that a federal court would look to favorably upon a legal action.  

In addition, we have not identified where the "credits" are if they are not on the customer's accounts.  

My recommendation is to first (a) work with SCE - have <NAME/> Dasovich run the traps and (b) discuss the issue with CPUC Division of Energy and see if there is a solution without Complaint. 

If this doesn't get us anywhere before August 19, then it seems that to protect our interest we would need to file a complaint with the CPUC.  I am not opposed to LeBouef looking into federal action, but that seems a bit dramatic without first trying to exhaust our adminstrative remedies.

Please call me.

<NAME/>

P.S. There is a meeting on the 1c/kwh surcharge with <NAME/> Dietrich today at 1:30 in her office.  I think you should attend.

<NAME/>, <NAME/> & <NAME/>,

I have samples of Group's VBS curriculum and Children's Church curriculum and would like to get together and see what you think.

Group's VBS this year is called Bug Safari (think "Bug's Life").  The bible lessons are about <NAME/> and play on theme of little in size, big in spirit.  The video (that can be used during refreshment time & is the basis of our Friday evening program) features Chatter the Chipmunk -- so we could reuse the adorable costume <NAME/> Turney made.  I would like to select the curriculum with you guys before we have our volunteer luncheon (which I would like to do in late Feb or early March).   I would also like to agree on the date in mid-late July for VBS.  I think I currently have 2 weeks penciled on the church calendar.

I also have ordered samples of Group's Children's Church curriculum.  I have been struggling lately with inspiration for new lessons and some pre-prepared lessons might help us draw in additional volunteers.  Most of our volunteers are enthusiastic about helping -- but not preparing -- a children's church worship.  

Evening meetings are difficult for me right now -- as there is much to do in the evenings and little time.  I would love to meet sometime this weekend if you are available.  (<NAME/> will be out of the country the first few weekends in Feb.) or I can meet on Fri. Feb 1 or Fri. Feb 8  - if either of those days suit.

With respect to past due PX credit amounts, <NAME/> has told folks today that:

<NAME/> will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts.
<NAME/> is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal.
<NAME/> hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.

We'll distribute <NAME/>'s proposal as soon as we get it.

Best,
<NAME/>

<NAME/>,

As mentioned in my voice mail on Friday, we have received a lawsuit filed by <NAME/> Lindert against <NAME/> Corp., EESO, and EES, Inc., in which he basically claims that he is due unpaid commissions.  He seeks damages of $1 million.

<NAME/> <NAME/> passed this lawsuit to me, but let me know if you want me to manage it on behalf of EES.  

I have contacted Chicago counsel (for information, not retention, purposes) to determine the answer date, which is 30 days.  I do not believe that we have been properly served, however, so we appear to have additional time.  The suit was filed 11/1, and we received it sometime last week, via cover letter to <NAME/> Lay from Lindert (rather bizzarre, if you ask me). 

The law firm representing the plaintiff is not some hack plaintiff's firm; it actually is a blue chip family law firm with a good reputation in Cook County.

The case probably should be removed to federal court due to diversity of citizenship.  According to the Seyfarth, Shaw lawyers I contacted on Friday, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Law Division is not a place where we would want to be, and federal court is preferable.  We have 30 days to remove to federal court.

Let me know how you want me to proceed.

I had a family emergency that I had to attend to prior to the holidays.  So I apologize, I haven't been in town.  Not sure what happened with our pre-arranged days to have discussions with your prospect, but hopefully we can reschedule.  Considering my situation now with my family, I will not be looking for a re-location anytime soon, but rather something either in Portland or within the West.  If Exelon is willing to explore opportunities with that in mind, then please set some time aside to discuss.  You can continue to reach me either at home (360-834-3579) or at work (503-464-3807).  I no longer have a cell phone available at this time.  Thank you for your time.  <NAME/> your holidays were good.

We will be setting up both physical and financial books for everyone.  I know not everyone will have physical but to keep it consistent everyone will have both just in case.  I have the 10 names you sent <NAME/> earlier, please let me know if that changes.  Do you know what the structure going to look like? ie.  will each trader be assigned specific curves/locations, cash vs. term, how many different people will be setting curves.

We will be starting over with our curve files also.  We want to only start with the true published curves.  We have many derived/internal curves that aren't necessary and if we need to create more curves we will look into it later.  Since the number of curves will be greatly reduced, we will probably start with one file.

<NAME/> Reeves and I met today with <NAME/> Taylor and <NAME/> Haedicke to discuss the eliminination of confirmations for transacations executed on EnronOnline.  <NAME/> Taylor has been supportive of the elimination of confirmations, and in the meeting today <NAME/> Haedicke agreed.  This elimination of confirmations will have to be reviewed on a counterparty by counterparty basis, and for each counterparty, commodity by commodity.  

Next steps:  Document EOL process and records that can evidence the execution of a transaction (ease of availability, type of 		record available, retention schedule for records, etc. (<NAME/> <NAME/>?)

	       Create a priortized list of counterparties to be approached for elimination of confirmations - large number of 			transactions, those that have asked for paper-relief, etc. (<NAME/> Reeves/<NAME/> Theriot)

	        Set up meeting with <NAME/> Zipper, <NAME/> Webb, <NAME/> Gros, <NAME/> Taylor, <NAME/> Hodge (Legal-Physical Gas), <NAME/> 		Saeger (Legal-Power), and <NAME/> Reeves to review game plan for elimination of confirmations and impact on 		ConfirmLogic (my assistant will set up meeting)

We have a # of counterparties whom credit will allow daily trading and/or balance of month trading (with no forward trading).  It would be much more efficient for the trading organization and the counterparties to have functionality within EOL that allowed for better credit screening.   We have moved away from the broker markets, and the current screening mechanism forces us to trade in the broker market with credit limited counterparties.

I would like to get this changed ASAP, if possible.

Thanks.

Hi, Georgi:
 
We have an entry in our database that states that Energy West Incorporated did not change its name to Mercator Energy Incorporated.  There are two companies with the same name and this one is not the one that changed its name.  Our Energy West Incorporated is a Montana corporation.  The one that changed its name is a Colorado corporation.

<NAME/> - Right after I had <NAME/> run over with the revised form and put it in the overnight, <NAME/> called me to say that the application will probably need the "sworn and subscribed" language before the notary stamp.   

Do you have a typewriter that you could type this in above the notary stamp?  Or perhaps feed it through your computer printer?  I sent three signed and notarized copies -- so you have a few extras to play with.



Here is the missing language


STATE OF TEXAS  
COUNTY OF HARRIS

Sworn and subscribed before me on this 26th day of November, 2001.



My conversation with <NAME/> was quite different than my conversation with <NAME/>.  While she said that it would be more convenient if we set a date like Jan 5 to travel to be able to buy the tickets in advance and hopefully get better fares.  She also acted like it is not out of the question that travel around Dec 17 might be possible if one didn't mind being away at <NAME/>tmas.

On my voice mail she left a message that my dossier had been received in Astana.  When I called her back she said that this was a mistake -- that what she meant was that it had been picked up at the embassy and was expected in Astana on Thurs or Fri.


You can call me at home tonight if you want to talk.

I got frustrated in trying to put together yesterday's lunch  - our list of senior directors and above in Net Works seemed incomplete.  I thought that <NAME/> was a senior director, and realized that his name was not on the list.  I asked <NAME/> to verify his title and to find out if he was in <NAME/> this week so that he could be included.  I didn't understand why he wasn't on the list.  Does he report to you?  <NAME/> that I didn't start a series of events that is wrong.  I thought that he did report to you and that that had been the case for several months.  So I didn't understand why HR's records were not correct.  --<NAME/>

We have approx 120 total seats for retail risk management on the 5th floor.   I think its important to put all power related retail functions (risk management, tariffs, structuring, risk reporting, etc.) on the 5th floor.

I just listened to the presentation on the GISB final rule on intraday recalls.

The final rule requires pipelines to support intraday recalls and allow the recalling shipper to nominate at each nomination cycle, but the implementation of the rule will be in two phases:

1. By May 2002, pipelines must file tariff revisions to be effective July 2002 to permit recalls at the evening cycle or for capacity which was not being used by the replacement shipper.

2. With respect to recalls during the flowing gas day, the Commission directs NAESB (GISB) to file comments by October 2002 on how these recalls should be accommodated, with reply comments by October 15.

Commissioner Massey noted that some parties claimed the new rule would undercut reliability.  Staff responded that if a shipper is worried about partial day recallability, then they should buy capacity release packages that are not designated as partial day recallable.  The releasing shipper can decide whether to offer the space with partial day recall rights or not.  

The discussion of the order seems to be in step with ETS pipeline 637 proposals to only allow intraday capacity release/recall at the timely and evening cycles at this time and say that we would need to build additional validations and need more time if required to allow recalls during the flowing gas day.  The fact that comments aren't even being filed on phase 2 until Oct.  -- I think we're safe to assume that this phase won't be implemented until 2003.

Hey guys (or actually for our current group, girls),

Let's plan on getting together on Wednesday, Aug. 1 from 2:00 to 3:30 in EB4180.  The following is a list of things that we need to discuss and they are in no particular order of priority.  To the extent that each of you could volunteer to come with some or all of the information on the following items, it will expedite our discussion (just let me know that you would like to begin pulling this information) :

Price Spreads for ROFR contracts to articulate our resubscription strategy.
Imbalances on OBA's
Analysis of I to I spreads.  -  Review past fixed rate transport deals and compare to the historical spreads.  Would we have made more money?  Is it reasonable to carve out a percentage of our capacity portfolio and always sell on an I to I rate?
Update Map - coordinate with <NAME/>, Facility Planning and NNG.
West Texas Leg - discussion on our preparation for the Facility Planning/Marketing Strategy Meeting.
Arizona Strategy - including Sun Devil.
Pooling.
Analysis of our business sold and utilized.  FT, Alt. Points, IT and contracts sold for specifically for flexible delivery points. (On this item, we can discuss the type of analysis we would like to look at in our staff meeting prior to pulling any information)
Weekend on call schedule - update
<NAME/>
Update - replacement for <NAME/>'s position.
Frequency of our staff meeting.

<NAME/>- Steel group wants to purchase $15.3 million per month of steel for 3 years. It appears this deal is creating inventory (no offsetting short). Do you have any thoughts on this as acting head of EIM? Doesn't sound like the best use of our liquidity at this point. <NAME/> (We have a million issues to address like this around the company).

Happy Thanksgiving to you too.  Things at <NAME/> don't look promising for anyone right now, but we'll see what happens.  The stock just keeps dropping and we have more debt around the corner.  <NAME/> and I are going to mom's on Thursday, then we are going to visit her grandparents over the weekend.  We are not going to the game, but we will be watching it on TV.  It doesn't look good for A&M because we got some key guys that are injured, hopefully we can make it a close game.  Have a safe trip and say hi to mimi for me. Talk to you soon. - <NAME/>

Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit 
NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. 
The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. 
"What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed," Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. 
The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. 
"There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work," Angelides said. 
Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. 
Angelides said PUC Commissioner <NAME/> Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President <NAME/> Lynch and other commissioners, "are not ready to act." 
Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. 
How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. 
Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. 
In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. 
The treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s. 
Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. 
Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. 
Eighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said.

Greetings folks:

We will temporarily suspend the Wednesday, 11:30 AM call until things settle down a bit.  If something crops up, we can set up a call to discuss.  In the meantime, we'll be communicating regularly outside the call.  Thanks very much.

Joe is set to rotate to real-time MW on June 1 and <NAME/> Rust is taking his scheduling place.   I have no problem with Joe going with you.   With respect to Narsima, timing may be an issue (transition), however, I should be able to make that happen as well.

With Busby, <NAME/>, Joe and Narsima (timing an issue), you have some competent support at the outset   In addition, there is almost certainly some capable people within the 200 person existing organization that have had no management direction and no discipline.

Hopefully, the dust settles and the transition can start next Monday.   We also need to figure out what we do with your existing positions.

<NAME/>,
      This would be preferable, but I don't understand what rules could be changed to alter the existing accounting treatment.  Also, <NAME/>'s numbers do not decline over the suggested ten year life of the project, and I'd bet that the injection and withdrawal rates decline just like they did after the project was initially developed.  The other thing to keep in mind is that there will be no long term contracts securing the anticipated cash flow.  We will be relying on our storage desk to secure margins in the short term market (which is the only way to do high injection/high withdrawal storage to capture short term market anomalies).  Are you okay with that?  I am.

Although not bitter, for years I have heard the story about being paid fair value for a job well done.. and that my time was coming...( just around the corner).... !! little did I know that when I made that turn, some guy named <NAME/>.( take a minute to imagine) ...was standing there with a baseball bat looking to smack my head a few times just to make sure I knew I wasn't quite there yet.

<NAME/>,
 
I would like to see the following notations added to the Gas Logistics CAPEX page to fully reflect the discussion and agreement.
 
With respect to the specific project listed:
 
1.  Gas Logistics is authorized to proceed with 4 Discretionary projects, including the three gas control network/security upgrades that you have listed and also the blanket desktop replacement project ($19,000) (omitted from your listing).  No further written proposal is required by Dynegy and restated capital budget will constitute the written authorization to proceed with these projects.
 
 
With respect to Footnote 2.  I believe the description below more precisely reflects our discussion:
 
2.  Dynegy requested and <NAME/> agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Contract System through June 30, 2002, UNLESS Dynegy authorizes <NAME/> to begin work on the customization and implementation of the NNG contract system prior to June 30, 2002.   To the extent that <NAME/> is not directed to begin work on the customization of the base contract system for NNG prior to June 30, 2002, it is understood that the implementation date of the NNG contract system will be impacted.
 
3.  Dynegy requested and <NAME/> agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Rates and Revenue System through June 30, 2002.  
 
 
An additional footnote should be added to the page.
 
4.    The 2002 Capital Budget does not currently authorize the system modifications that will be necessary to implement NNG's Order 637 filing/revised filing provisions or GISB changes.   Dynegy and <NAME/> will need to mutually agree whether to commence work on these modifications to meet filing commitments or expected FERC requirements.

OK, the fun continues.

We need to assign EOL products to traders.  <NAME/> sent a file (Netco\controls\Trader-Book template (US Gas)_EOL new books) with all products and the old book assignments.  We need to get with the traders today and get these split out.....many will stay the same as before.  

Also, when physical deals are done, will all risk types go to the same desk or will one person be managing the index separately.  ex. the west desk used to book all index to Grigsby's book.  I have told <NAME/> that all risk types will go to that trader's book but if index needs to be changed let me know.

You have the right <NAME/> Presto.   I have been employed at <NAME/> now for almost 7 years.   I currently oversee the company's power trading and marketing business in the Eastern US.    Unfortunately, I spend entirely too much time at work, but I love the job and <NAME/>'s culture in general.

How are you doing?   I have not seen any of my Tri-City classmates in many years.   I think the last time I saw you was at <NAME/> Bayless' wedding (85-86?) if my memory is correct.

<NAME/> -

1.	The best split is probably just 50/50 on personnel.  While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart, many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles.  The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward (for example, if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter).
2.	In terms of approving outside service expenditures, I would like to sit down with you, <NAME/>, and <NAME/> to work out what the best method of working through the approvals.  I will try and set up some time the first week of December.
4.	I have put <NAME/> Montovano in the NE Gas box.  This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).  I have attached a new org chart to represent this change.

Also, <NAME/> Staines (who is not on the Org Chart) has an Employment contract that ends 6/12/2002.  <NAME/> has been working on Florida and Northeast RTO matters and continues to help East Power with the NYISO TCC auction.  We can sever him, but his contract will need to be paid off ($87k).  Govt Affairs also has a contract for support with Joe <NAME/> (ex-Southern exec) to support our SE activities.  I am trying to get a copy of the contract, but I think that it is in place until 8/02.  My recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today.    

Thanks,

<NAME/>

<NAME/>,
 
When I said spread I didn't mean graph the basis as opposed to the fixed price (these graphs are essentially identical to the first ones you did) I want a graph of the relationship (spread) between the 2 points. i.e. if Nov-Mar Sumas was marked at 0.20 and Nov-Mar Aeco was marked at (0.45) the Nov-Mar Sumas Aeco spread would be 0.65. Sorry if I wasn't clear. Call me with any ?s.

Hey thanks for the Thanksgiving invitation!   I thought I would die from exhaustion if I had to drop one more hint.  I'll either whip up one of my famous gourmet dishes or stop off at the liquor store for wine, and if I do bring wine it will be the very best box wine 7/11 has to offer.  But in either case I will not be bringing any of my hotties, I'm having them all sent out for chemical bathes so they will be clean for the holidays.

Thanks Again

State discloses spot power  buys

By <NAME/>  LaMar
TIMES STAFF WRITER  


SACRAMENTO -- They range from small power  sales of $922,000 by the East Bay Municipal Utility District to more than $1  billion of power sold by Atlanta-based Mirant power company.  

All told, California paid $7.7  billion in spot purchases of electricity from 69 agencies across the United  States during the first five months of 2001, according to a report delivered to  lawmakers Monday.  

The data also shows that the state paid a hefty average of $263 per  megawatt-hour for the power. But what's most striking is the long list of  agencies, both private and public, that sold power to California.  

Agencies like the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, $331 million;  the California Independent System Operator, $3.9 million; Public Service Company  of New Mexico, $126 million; and PG&E Energy Trading Company, $24 million.  

Receiving the most money was Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold $1.2 billion of  electricity to the state January through May. The second-largest seller was  Powerex, a subsidiary of Canada's BC Hydro, which earned $1 billion.  

The total cost per day ranged from as little as $20 million to more than $100  million on three separate days in May, when hot weather and tight supplies  boosted spot market prices.  

In addition, the report reveals that the state's energy consultants  significantly underestimated the amount of energy the state would need to buy in  April and May. Navigant Consulting, Inc., forecast the state would have to buy  12.1 million megawatt-hours for the two months but the state ended up purchasing  15.1 million megawatt-hours.

We have not been billing interest.  The system does not generate an interest invoice until the disputed amount is paid.  Then, based upon when it's paid, the interest is calculated.

In another surprise move, the PUC approved an <NAME/> bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation."  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to <NAME/>'s SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:

The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003
Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in <NAME/>'s past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection")
If <NAME/> collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change
If <NAME/> has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
<NAME/> can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
<NAME/> cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
<NAME/> can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
<NAME/> will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of <NAME/>'s rates)
The PUC will not fine <NAME/> during this period if <NAME/>'s capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure
<NAME/> must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
<NAME/> agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.
The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the "special" session that the Governor recently announced

We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.

Best,
<NAME/>

This got to me tonight - If we come back, or when we come back we need to remember this guy.  I have no idea who he is but please can we hire him back if/when we get EnronOnline back on top.  We need to remember him next year.

A great reflection on you guys too.

Tuesday, Dec. 4 
I was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of. We had unmatched talent and skill. We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon. We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve. But, above all, an unbreakable commitment to help make <NAME/> Online great. Throughout the decline we did what we had always done -- we did our best. 
* * * * *  "<NAME/> took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office. ... They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too."  <NAME/> Hommel,  former <NAME/> employee * * * * * 	
We have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at <NAME/> and we all know the names of those to blame. At the end of it all, the truth is that bad things happen. For myself I humbly asked for only one thing: The chance to rebuild <NAME/> Online. I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted. Around 9 p.m. I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news. In the utmost professional manner, I was informed that there was no good news. 
Now it's over. I still get a bit choked up when I think about it. I don't work at <NAME/>, and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets. I made some good friends at <NAME/>, but I know I won't see many of them again. <NAME/> took those friendships, <NAME/> took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight. They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5-1, despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played. They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too. 
But let me say this. I have my memories. I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal. I am going to keep my memories. They belong to me.

Here is the payoff info for the unsecured note:

Assuming the note is paid before the 7/20 payment is due:  $36,523 + $7/day accrued interest since 6/20.  For example, if paid on 7/18 the balance would be $36,719.

If the Kuo's make the payment due on 7/20, then the payoff amount would be $36,304 + $7/day accrued interest after 7/20.

The amortization schedule is attached.

<NAME/>,

So its time for Monday night football and I was thinking about how you'd hitting on some waitress at Hooters.  Ahhhhh those were the days!   How are things going?  What's new in the world?  Things here seem to be running there course.  Remember the movie Wall Street where they arrest "<NAME/> Fox" for insider trading and it is the beginning of the end.  Well I think <NAME/> might have worked here, and the whole company seems to be coming down with him.  I don't know if it is getting much press in Canada but the mighty <NAME/> has fallen on hard times and we are in the process of merging with another company down here as a way of staying afloat.  We seem to have run out of cash and can't pay the bills.  Visa and Mastercard are maxed out.  Its kind of got me soul searching and I'm trying to decided what to do next.  I can stay where I am and wait and see what comes of the merger, but its kind of like sticking with the Expo's, no one is certain what the future is. Or, I can try and jump ship, catch on with another gas trading company, but the problem is the grass is Never as green on the other side of the fence.  Hence the soul searching and dilemma.  Anyway, I just thought I'd drop you a note, see how things are going.  Dolphins seem to be doing ok, 6-2, life could be worse.

I'm going to Tampa Bay for American Thanksgiving and kind of looking forward to the couple of days off.  And I'm coming to Calgary for Christmas.  I get in late Friday the 21st and head back to <NAME/> Sunday the 30th.  Maybe we could get everyone together and go skiing one day, drinks at minimum.  Anyway I have to get back to work.  I hope all is well in Cow town and say hi to one of the waitress for me tonight

Sorry!  Here are the bullets: 
- 2,500 mile pipeline extending from west Texas to the California border with 1.7 Bcf/day of peak capacity
- Maximum Rate Environment Due to Increased California Demand
- Bi-Directional Flow Capabilities Provides Flexibility to Rapidly Adapt Regional Demand
- Over 90% of Revenues From Demand Charges
- Western Deliveries Fully Subscribed Through Dec 2005, Eastern Deliveries Fully Subscribed Through Dec 2002; Well-Positioned for Recontracting
- No New Rate Case Until November 2006
- Overbuilding into Cal. can compromise resubscription of contracts (not unique to TW)

The slide includes these bullets, a map of TW and a barchart with 1999-2001 throughput.  I asked <NAME/> to change the 90% to 80% in 4th bullet.  How do you feel about the "Maximum Rate Environment ..." bullet?

Attached is a spreadsheet summarizing hourly TTC and ATC data for COB S/N from Jan 1, 2000 to April 2001.  The data were obtained from the ISO.
After looking at the data, it is clear that, although the TTC values have not changed from '00 to '01, the ATC values have decreased dramatically.  I believe the reason for this is the ISO's attempt to prevent exports to the Northwest.

I propose that we send this spreadsheet to our ISO rep (via <NAME/> <NAME/>) and ask him to explain the reason for the reduction.

I spoke with <NAME/> today to tell her that my notarized INS approval is in the mail.  She said she is really busy because <NAME/> is on vacation.  She reiterated the point that you made that there is another group traveling to Almaty before us.  They are not traveling until Nov. 15.  We will be after that -- perhaps a week or 10 days later.   

This journey is certainly full of ups and downs.  I was thrilled to receive INS approval and am now discouraged about not traveling until late November or early December.  

I was thinking about making an appeal for us to go before the Almaty group.  What do you think?  Perhaps you have better standing for such an appeal given your health concerns for Oksana.

I went up to Chicago last week and noticed the lack of flat panels in the office.  We obviously have hundreds of redundent ones in ENA <NAME/> (as the new building has new ones), they are going to redeploy them to you guys - Free (as we have already paid for them).  They are going to start with Calgary and Toronto.

I am sending you as promised the PowerPoint presentations about different units

my group and 2 pure quants to the new company. I have no commitments from the pure
quant side at this point, so I cannot give you any specific names.

Hi Ms. Traylor,

I gave my mom a heads up that "flat <NAME/>" would be arriving in the mail soon -- but it seems like
recent mail jitters are coming into play.  Before poor <NAME/> is needlessly tossed on fears of biological
terrorism could you confirm whether Master <NAME/> might be in a brown envelope?  I didn't have Ms. Jung's
email.

<NAME/> all is well with you.  I am so pleased with how happy <NAME/> is with school.  At first he expected to be 
coddled like Kindergarten and complained that 1st grade was too hard.  Boy how things have changed in a month.
Yesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard -- Kindergarten was soooooo boring.

I really appreciate the firm, yet compassionate manner you have with the kids.  It is just what <NAME/> needs to develop.

While I'm writing, I will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up at school.  Over the summer we hosted
a 4-year old orphan girl (<NAME/>) from Kazakhstan.  She had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her.  The other day, <NAME/> was watching TV and saw a picture of some Afghan children.  He commented how much they look
like <NAME/> and then burst out in tears.  If the school works on a project for the Afghan kids, <NAME/> may seem a little more emotional than usual -- just wanted you to know.

Regards,

<NAME/> Corman  (<NAME/>'s Mom)

Really don't want to write anymore notes.  while he's a friend, and i've known him since he was a lowly VP, sending lots of emails to CEOs, even in a flat org. like enron, is, well, bad form.  let's see what happens.  just let ian know that there's a chance that the meeting might take place prior to the EES debrief.

Great.  As we discussed, we'll need the final query to list all counterparties for each product with net quantities stated for each day (dates listed as column headings) of the current month.  Ideally, the query will be executed daily and posted in html or xls on the Gas Fundy website.  I understand that we do not yet have permission from EOL to hit their database regularly and that you will have someone else from your team finish out this task.

I have had some research done on the issue of what was found on the computers in the Ecoelectrica offices.  It looks like the best course of action is to destroy all of the identified materials.  Mere possession of these materials is a violation of law.  Our outside counsel called the FBI, which said that if the company does not know who put the materials out there, it does not have  a duty to report it.

We also received advice that the Puerto <NAME/> office of the FBI might be able to assist in narrowing down the possible users to determine who actually was involved.  Our outside counsel suggested that we might want to call the local FBI office and talk with a duty agent.  The number is 787-754-6000.  Given the situation of the possible sale, however, we may choose not to take that route.

In any event, if we don't report it, all illegal materials must be destroyed and removed from our systems as soon as possible.

Realistically, only the trading support provided for straight-forward gas and power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode.  I would say that the only part of IT Development costs that could be considered in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing fees.  Capital projects don't make sense on a cost per transaction basis - should be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit sponsor and ENW agree upon. 

While we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction, I still have concerns about this on a lot of levels.  Frankly, the relationship between the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the EOL relationship.  If we are boxed into a cost per transaction, then whenever <NAME/> Lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad hoc analysis of P&L, we would need to discuss this as a change order and price accordingly.  Practically speaking, there is not one of the ad hoc trader requests that isn't needed yesterday, and stopping to negotiate whether the request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get me and my risk team fired!  I also have a big concern over pushing the envelope on an arms length service arrangement.  I will have trouble recruiting and retaining the best people.  The guys on my operations team honestly work every day with the business goals of EA in mind.   They work hard to insure success for EA.  That is what <NAME/> and <NAME/> should want.  Push us back too far and no one will like the results if we don't have people fully dedicated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support.  It is kind of ironic.  I think that <NAME/> is pleased with how I've managed operations, and one of my goals when I took the role a few years back was to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make sure that this works for <NAME/>.  I have some really good people who are very motivated, and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewed as an integral part of the team at EA, EGM, EIM, etc.  We had to work hard to achieve that, but we've gotten there for the most part.  So how odd it is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contributor to the success that we have had.  EES is reeling right now partly because they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team, nor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their business in full.  And now I have been asked to help correct that.  Makes you kind of wonder...

I am fully supportive of running operations (and ENW) like a business, with a critical eye toward delivering value effectively.  When I first took this role I told my team that at that time we were the service provider of circumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the service provider of choice.  A component of this is definitely striving for lower costs and higher value delivered.  We can continue to improve on this, but going too far may produce the wrong answer for <NAME/>.  --<NAME/>

The data is actually aggregated and netted, the specific deal data is not provided.   The detail he described might be the aggregate of 40 deals at that point none of which may directly relate to transportation deals.   See the bolded data below.   The example given basically says I am in a position of having more gas at Ventura in January 2002
than I have commitments to sell by 10 MMCF/d.     Did you understand that?

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like it did when we were trying to break $5.

Vladi,

I don't know if you are going to get this in time, but I wanted to try to get some of you input on a deal you price earlier for Yankee Gas.  Structuring needs you Gas Daily Daily offer for 30 peak day at TETCO M3.  You previously indicated US$0.13 for 40,000 a day and it looks like they are going to do the whole volume.  They will notify you by 9:00 am the day before delivery.

I don't know what the right price is but it would seem that we could anticipate their need to call and get in front of  the market moves.  I am going to stick with the 0.13/mmbtu unless I hear from you.

I hope the vacation is going well.  Sorry to disturb you.

Zo,

What's up my brother?  Long time no speak.  I just got your email from <NAME/> P (somehow he found me).  Anyway,  I'd like to give you  a call sometime and catch up, so definitely send me your number.  I don't know if you knew, but I moved back to <NAME/> again for a job with <NAME/>.  I've been here over a year now working on the natural gas floor.  Life is good, but nothing real exciting to report.  So, I just realized that next weekend is homecoming.  Any chance that anyone is going?  I wasn't planning on it, but if a bunch of people were going I could still get a cheap flight into Ithaca, but I'd have to buy it today.  If you wouldn't mind, send me a quick email to let me know if anyone is going....

Well, since I hope to talk to you soon...that's it.

If this truly cleans out the closet then it is worth it.  The potential upside of the Entex Audit is more like $2 - $3 million but our ability to recover that much is questionable given the weak contract language for resolving non-performance.  In the past ENA and Entex resolved volume shortfalls under the term contract by extending the term.  Obviously we will not have that remedy.  Do not let AEP separate other issues away from this and try to pick us to death.

These are Monday dates.  With the original date being October 2, a Tuesday, I just wanted to double check the dates with you.  Unfortunately, neither date works for me.  I am taking the day off on the 8th - <NAME/> has a school holiday and we will be in Dallas for Mustang Monday at SMU.  The program there ends at 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon, and we will have driven to  Dallas, so I can't make it work to be in <NAME/> that evening.  And on the 15th, I have a monthly National <NAME/> League meeting.  As president-elect, I am trying to make all of the meetings.

Go ahead and include counterparties on our power list even if they do not have any outstanding trades.  That way, if anyone is comparing our lists later on their will be no discrepancy and they won't have to ask us again.

The ARM group is going back and forth on what they want to say in their filing on the specifics of the DA suspension (many parties with many interests).  There continues to be debates over the specifics.  Soon as there is a draft that folks have reasonably agreed to, I'll send it to you.  If you have any questions, give a holler.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
	FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION

Texas Gas Transmission Corporation   				Docket No.
RP01-278-002
                                                      
	NOTICE OF COMPLIANCE FILING

	(October 22, 2001)

Take notice that on October 17, 2001, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation
(Texas Gas) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First
Revised Volume No. 1, the  following tariff sheets to become effective
October 1, 2001:

                                <NAME/>
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                Sheet No. 184 (reserved)
                                Second Revised Sheet No. 185
                                
                                <NAME/>
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                
Texas Gas states that this filing is being submitted in compliance with the
Commission's Order issued on September 19, 2001 in the above-referenced
docket.  As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index
price for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a
cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the
weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following
month.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of
imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above
5%.
However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all
imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level
from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this
tier of imbalance.

Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed
to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington,
D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section
154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.  Protests will be considered by the
Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not
serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.  Copies of this filing
are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.
This filing may also be viewed on the web at http://www.ferc.gov using the
"RIMS" link, select "Docket#" and follow the instructions  (call
202-208-2222 for assistance).  Comments, protests and interventions may be
filed electronically via the Internet in lieu of paper.  See, 18 CFR
385.2001(a)(1)(iii) and the instructions on the Commission's web site under
the "e-Filing" link.

Here is 1997-2000 TW Transportation Revenue by Contract, Sorted by Contract Expiration Date.  To get a breakdown of long-term/short-term, for each year I would include contracts that expire within the next year & IT as short term, with the remainder as LT.  For example, for 1997, I'd say that the revenues from contracts that expire on or before 12/31/98 + IT make up the short term revenues.

We prepared resolutions regarding the opening of brokerage agreements (the ones dated 11/30/2000), which authorized <NAME/> to be a second signatory, however, the problem arose when we tried to get <NAME/> <NAME/> in the Corporate Secretary's office to certify a certificate of incumbency for <NAME/>.  <NAME/> has never officially been elected to the office of Vice President of Risk Assessment and Control, a division of <NAME/> Corp., so as far as the corporate records are concerned, she is not officially a Vice President.  This will be resolved at the <NAME/> Corp. Board Meeting in August and her appointment will be retroactive to November 1, 2000.  Until such time as this has occurred, she cannot be a second signature on our brokerage documents.

I have book positions in the NE market and am very comfortable with our curves through 2004 in all of these markets.    NEPOOL came off very hard today ($2.00/Mwh through 2006) while the NY markets were off only $0.50 - $1.00/Mwh.   I am paying close attention to these markets given the corporate risk and I don't see any marks unreasonable given where 02 and 03 are actually trading.

Again - I will continue to monitor as we work toward integrating the positions.

Thanks.

Hold on.  <NAME/> and I discussed it, but it is not my call whether anyone other than EES bears those costs.  For what it's worth, I agreed with <NAME/> that to the extent <NAME/> and <NAME/> had reached agreement regarding, among other things, <NAME/>'s use of the corporate aircraft for non-EES purposes, that it may not make sense to have EES bear those costs.

We discussed the process of doing away with the confirmations for EnronOnline transactions in our last group meeting.  It looks like the most equitable way to staff these is to rotate them among the lawyers like we rotate masters among the paralegals.  No one should end up with more than two or three of them that way.  <NAME/> Moore is taking a first cut using the form and adding the power-specific provisions and then sending them on to the gas group.  The gas group will then forward them to me for us to include any derivatives-specific provisions.

The product description was to be used for various pipelines (e.g. NGPL, Transco, etc.). Yes, in this product ENA would always be the seller or the buyer of the capacity to be released.  I visited with <NAME/> earlier, and the concept that <NAME/> Gomez had discussed earlier was allowing third party pipelines or third parties to use EOL to buy and sell capacity from or to other third parties.  As far as I know, these were just discussions and the only EOL product implemented was the one I forwarded to you.

Hello <NAME/>,

It's been a long time since I last wrote you but here I am again. I am still working for <NAME/>, but I moved away from Oregon. Now me and my husband are living in <NAME/>, Texas. 
I worked in Portland until May of this year and then I though of moving away from Oregon just because opportunities are not as big there. In Portland I wroked as a power real time trader buying and selling power real time. I got tired of that job because of shift work. This summer I joined the forests products department and right now I do analysis for the traders. I ahve taken a couple of derivatives classes offered in the company and plan to take some more. My goal is to move to a trader's position, mostly financial trader to work with derivatives but we will see what happens. Right now I am learning about the market, and how it functions. 

I plan on taking some classes next term at Rice University in <NAME/>. I need to have better mathematical skills and I will start taking math classes at night after work. We will see how this goes. i have to prepare myself well for the future. 

That's all on work side. 
Moving to <NAME/> was quite a change. The  weather especially. Right now though the weather is great, it's sunny and in the mid-70s to 80s. I love it. Koli likes Portland better. <NAME/> is a much bigger city and a little more dangerous. I like it though, what I miss is Corvallis and school. I miss business school at OSU and studying for finance classes. I want to go back to school eventually and get both MBA and PHD so I can teach. I would love to be a professor. 

So how are you? How is your wife? Your kids? Is anything new happening? What about your parents in NY? Are they OK from all that has happened?  
What about OSU? Anything new there? How is prof. Moulton? Say hi to him from me. What about the students? Are you still demanding of them? You know I remember that I put a lot of work in your classes.

We plan to go home this Christmas and meet our families. My parents ask me about you all the time. They had the greatest time when they visited me here. 

well that's all for now but I will keep in touch more often. Let me know how thigs are going with you,

say hi to your wife from me
best wishes,
<NAME/>

Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit 
NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. 
The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. 
"What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed," Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. 
The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. 
"There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work," Angelides said. 
Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. 
Angelides said PUC Commissioner <NAME/> Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President <NAME/> Lynch and other commissioners, "are not ready to act." 
Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. 
How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. 
Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. 
In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. 
The treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s. 
Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. 
Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. 
Eighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said.

I worlked with <NAME/> Gosset, <NAME/> White and <NAME/> Hall today on their input for proposed promotions for Operations.  <NAME/> Cashion has the recommended names and salary increases.  Do you need anything else?  Description of their respoinsibilities, rationale for promotion recommendation, etc.?  Let me know.  

I mentioned to <NAME/> that letters had been given to both <NAME/> Gossett and <NAME/> Superty in late November or December stating that they would be promoted from Director to Senior Director at the first of the year.  We have <NAME/> covered, but with the change in <NAME/> Superty's reporting relationship, I want to be certain that his promotion doesn't fall through the cracks.  <NAME/> was somehow unaware of these letters, although they were prepared by HR.  As you review the entire list of proposed promotions, please be check to make sure that <NAME/> Superty's name was submitted by <NAME/> <NAME/> for a promotion.

California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail By <NAME/> Taub  Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray <NAME/>'s office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity market -- information <NAME/> has been trying to keep secret -- through a misdirected e-mail.  The e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was intended for members of the governor's staff, said <NAME/> spokesman <NAME/> Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press list, he said.  <NAME/> is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would compromise negotiations for future contracts. This week, <NAME/> appealed a state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through June 27. The state is buying electricity on behalf of utilities, which are burdened by debt.  ``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of the e-mail. ``We have a meeting every morning where we discuss issues of the day.'' The e-mail contained minutes of today's meeting, he said.  According to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of electricity for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough electricity to light 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged from $25 to $149.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the e-mail is accurate.  Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a megawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to Bloomberg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot market, according to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on the day-ahead market.  The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-market purchases once a quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying strategies tailored to each season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legislators say state law requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed.

People down here are shocked!  One of the brokers we use was in the second tower when the first plane hit.  All he said was that something blew up and he was getting the (*!@##$ out of there.   Sounds like it was a good decision as he was in the stairwell on the 20th floor when the second plane hit his tower.  He got out alright but many of his co-workers are still missing.  Lots of people have friends and family that worked there so people are keeping pretty much to themselves.  As for me.........I'm wondering why I moved to this country!  Things here are ok but I question everyday whether or not I made the right decision.  Hopefully, some good things start happening to me.  So far I have lost money trading, live with two cats I can't stand, don't have a car to drive (or any of my personal belongings) and this country is on the verge of going to war.  I figure things can only get better!

I'm back in town from the 19th-23rd...(assuming I can fly back)...and hopefully we can hook-up then.  If you need some kitchen-ware (i.e.. utensils) let me know and I'm sure we can work out a deal (There is no room for my stuff in this apartment).

<NAME/> you are doing well and say hi to everyone for me.

Drew,
      The 2002 Transwestern fuel hedges were all done with ENA.  Currently those hedges are approximately $17.0m in the money.  Our ENA hedges would certainly be rejected by a Trustee in bankruptcy.  Since these were affiliate transactions, I would assume that these positions were all layed off to a non-<NAME/> counterparty.  Is there a way that we can get assignment of the offsetting counterparty transactions?  If not, we could have a big hole for next year.

I'm not sure I would give a list of topics (I'd hate to see what would come of the PRC video!).  Perhaps we should just suggest a general theme which would be consistent with the forward-looking thrust of the conference -- e.g. a challenge we currently face or will have to overcome to get where we want to go.

Hello Everyone,

It is time to get started in our quest to figure out the N.E.  Given that we are coming to the end of the heating season our best opportunities to make money over the next little while will be with respect to storage, storage arbitrage, and opportunities surrounding the injection season.   Having this in mind I think the best place to start is with the pipe that has the most storage capabilities and flexibility, and I think that is Columbia Gas Transmission.  I am inviting everyone to attend a meeting Tuesday at 3:00 (location to follow) to discuss the who, what, where, when, why, and how.   In preparation for the meeting we need to have information regarding the pipe:

1)	We need the operational capabilities of the pipe.   This should include major receipt points, delivery points, through put capability, line pack balances, and storage facilities (both owned by the pipeline as well as third parties).  Expect to discuss which regions are the bottle necks, and what operational restrictions or advantages individual locations have. (<NAME/>, Meredith, <NAME/> or <NAME/> could you please try to track down some of this info)

2)	We need to talk about trading and transacting in this region.  Proper contracts with the pipe, what flexibility we have (or could get), transportation costs within the region, etc....(<NAME/>, Meredith, <NAME/> or <NAME/> could you please try to track down some of this info)

3)	<NAME/> players on the pipeline LDC's, Industrials, Power Generators, and production companies (i.e.. native production on the pipe) (<NAME/> and <NAME/> could you please gather this info)

4)	Price Curves and trading opportunities for the region.  (I will be supplying the data for this part of the discussion)

Please come ready to talk freely about what you know and please understand that the point of this is to figure out what pieces of information we lack and to make everyone better informed.  I look forward to see you all on Tuesday.

Regards,

<NAME/>

Ashley --

First, hope you have great Thanksgiving Holiday.  

Luiz Maurer and others put together the following set of questions for NG to potentially discuss at the upcoming meeting or earlier.  If you have any questions, please call me.

Also, <NAME/> will sign on to a petition to for extension of time in the NG/ARTO case (not sure when this is due out).  Some other people were pushing it and with everything going on here at <NAME/> we needed more time to respond.  Please don't take this as a signal that we can't continue to discuss and maybe help find a solution.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

=============================

1) Profit-RTO - Where does your proposed organization fit in the attached graph in terms of end state ? Stage III? Stage IV?

 

2) Regarding document "Response of National Grid USA to questions posed by the Commission": Does it imply that core, for profit functions should not be subject to a stakeholder process? Wasn't the NETA design subject to an extensive 
consultation, even for profit, NG core functions?

3) If each Transco manages it own OASIS, how can we avoid fragmentation (balkanization), pancaking and many other
negative aspects and seams that the RTO process is trying to eliminate? How can you achieve one-stop shopping? By outsourcing those functions to one single third party?

4) As a follow up question, what are the mechanisms to assure that this "potential" fragmentation may lead to underinvestments in T, particularly in important inter-tie investments?

5) What kind of PBR mechanism are you envisioning for the Transco-RTO? Are you thinking about including "external" measures such as cost to provide ancillary services, congestion costs or costs incurred in energy balancing?

6) Are you envisioning an RTO-Transco model which will assume that all transmission assets in the region will be divested? Or can the model live with a "light" RTO where part of the assets are divested but others are not (and sign an operating agreement with the RTO. Would your proposed Matrix of RTO Functions (page 9) still be robust under this scenario?

7) Can your proposed RTO model dovetail with an LMP/Congestion Management system based on financial rights? [Our understanding is that NETA completely reorganized the UK pool. The UK system now looks like a "self-dispatch" physical rights model] 

8) As a follow up of the previous question: Assuming Alliance adopts a self-dispatch, physical rights approach similar to the one NG operates in the UK today. <NAME/>'t you think that this will create significant barriers/seams with other neighboring RTOs, considering that there seems to be a general trend towards security constrained dispatch, LMP and financial rights for most RTOs in the US?

9) If your proposed system can be dovetailed to a central dispatch, LMP/financial rights, shouldn't some functions in your "Martix of RTO Functions" be collapsed? For example: management of congestion prices, calculation of congestion, operations of energy markets and generation redispatch?

10) Procurement and deployment of ancillary services is listed as non-core. However, in the UK system, this represents a significant role of the Transco, with incentives and penalties attached to its achievement. Is there a different vision or do you assume that those functions will end up being developed by the RTO and consequently will be part of the PBR formula?

11) Generation interconnection. Obviously, your proposal did not go that far. Conceptually, do you favor a system whereby T fixed costs are recovered via a postage stamp rate across an entire region or do you favor the UK model whereby fixed costs (use of the system) are calculated based on incremental cost and have a strong locational component (and connection costs are treates separately, according to a shallow method?

12) Establishment of transmission rates. How to reconcile the fact that those should be regulated and you propose that the Transco itself will establish its T rates? Are you thinking about some possible non-regulated activities?

13) You stated that separation and control of T assets persists, to a large extent, in the Collaborative Model proposed as part of the Southeast Mediation. Do you think that the Independent System Administration model is superior in this regard? What are the key important differences in your view in the conceptual design of those models

Please look at two supply deals with Enserco at the Citygate for March 2001.  Nov-Mar deal, number 396352, at 11.27 and a March only deal, number 63338(?),  at 10.59.  They are contesting the fact that we allocated all cuts to the highest priced deal.  Cost $72000.  Please take a look at these deals and the cuts and let me know if we should agree to their argument and reallocate 50/50.

i just cant get too enthused about the short side.  why did cash go out trading +5 for a weekend when there was zero power gen demand.  the easy answer is that pipes were short and everybody playing catchup from this week.  fine.  what's it going to trade next week.  the gas daily swap implies flat, but it's lagged the actual spread all month.  i think cash surprises by trading positive next week with no power gen.  this market is not trading like we run out of injection space.  so either the market is wrong (maybe but a dangerous assumption to make) or I don't see why sep is so overvalued relative to the rest of the curve.  you can certainly argue that the winter and cal 2 are too high, but those certainly don't seem to be going down very fast.  march is off 8 cents since jun 29.  so if the market wants to say that march is worth 354, then why is sep too high at 298?

Good Morning..........sir,

I am wearing my sweatshirt and my new boots to work, so my feet are warm and I feel like I have you wrapped around me. My roses are starting to really open up now, they are so beautiful.

I had fun at the party last night, danced my fool head off.  Good natured fun dancing with the buds from work.  One guy tried to dip me and failed miserably, I fell on my right hip, but not before I nearly knocked myself unconcious on part of the wall. I ended up sitting there for a minute with a packet of frozen soybeans on my noggin.  I told him no more of that stuff. On the way home from the party I almost just showed up at your house, but figured you needed a break from me for some rest.  

You have a good day, hope you are rested and feeling good.

One group needs to mark curves.   I personally think it is easier for us to mark curves because we have traders in every region.   I simply need to make it a priority again.   I can go either way, though.   We definitely don't want two sets of curves.

Two issues that we should work on -- First Energy discusses CBM (not sure of their position) and MAPSA deals with ICAP.  My recollection is that ICAP will not be addressed at this time?  Seems to me that we should  try and propose some resolution or at a minimum a separate proceeding to mediate this issue before 1/1/03?  What do you think?  On CBM, now is the time for FERC to get rid of this discriminatory practice.

This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to <NAME/> Whitt and <NAME/> Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
<NAME/> Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
<NAME/> Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by <NAME/> Tycholiz and <NAME/> Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating <NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/> in their new roles.

I'm not in the business of providing firm pricing via e-mail.   As always, all prices from the desk are indicative until customer is ready to pull the trigger.   As a rule of thumb, prices are good for about 15 minutes.

Therefore, let's be clear with the counterparty that we are in a volatile energy market with pricing moving 5-10% on some days.   For example, summer power is down $20.00/Mwh over the past week and June is down $10/Mwh.   <NAME/> 02 and summer 03 are down $7-8/Mwh over the past 3 days.

Thanks.

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		<NAME/> Rub
+	Development		<NAME/> Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			<NAME/> Oxley
+	Cash Management	<NAME/> Myers
+	Credit			<NAME/> Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. <NAME/> and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers
				Phase  3 Customers
+	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc)
+	Customer visit schedule

Product Side
+	List of Products	Phase 1 - First Week
				Phase 2 - First Month
				Phase 3 - First Quarter

Target Number of Transactions
+	Phase 1
+	Phase 2
+	Phase 3

<NAME/>,  thanks for the notice of this meeting.  I'm glad you will be attending.  FYI, the Aquila folks purchased USGT from <NAME/> MacKenzie about 18 months ago and I'm not sure how they have incorporated the USGT organization into the Aquila organization.  Since you are the new kid, perhaps you can inquire as to the differences in these shops so that you can effectively deal with both organizations.  I'm not sure we've ever been clear on this.  Please continue to talk about Red <NAME/> with these folks.  What would Aquila like to see TW offer?  What are their thoughts about the West markets?  What could TW do to get Aquila to be more active on our pipe? 

FYI, I am coming into the office Wed morning.  I will be in EB4179.  I need to meet with <NAME/> and pack up this office.  I should be in by 9:00.  If your schedule permits, perhaps you and I could meet for a few minutes on Agave before your 10:00 Aquila meeting?

I'll call you when I get in.

Joceyln,

I've had a change in my schedule today and I won't drop off the check in person.  I deposited the <NAME/> check in my bank account this am on my way to work (to make sure I get the cash before any bankruptcy filing) and will have a personal check couriered over to your office.

Unless you instruct otherwise, I will make the check out to Salomon Smith <NAME/> and put the caption FBO <NAME/> Corman in the Memo line of check.  Let me know if an account number should appear on the check.

I think there are issues with this as essentially we are changing the business model - we need to hire into the areas we are lacking people asap in order to ensure we have coverage as much as possible.

<NAME/>,

We can definitely help <NAME/>. We are producing the demand projections for
natural gas by state, by customer class every day. The projections
are used to forecast AGA storage numbers and have a very
good history of hitting the right number. This validate svery well the
demand model.

Getting the supply curve at a specific location is more difficult because
other regions are competing for the same finite quantity of gas
available in the short run. We have some good insights into this
problem as well.

My concern is that summer associates are not fully committed to <NAME/>.
I have about 7-8 summer associates every year and we always take measures
to keep them away from critical information.
Please, let me know how far we can go with <NAME/>.

I am ready to help you with baseball. I went to a game last week
and Astros won. I guess I brought some good Karma.

<NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/>:

You may recall that ENE has been in the process of documenting two forwards, effective 10/3/01, and two puts, effective 10/1/01.  The forwards consisted of rolls of outstanding forwards with Lehman.  These transaction confirmations were signed by <NAME/> DeSpain on Friday, October 19, 2001. 

In that regard, I have faxed to your attention the two (2) REVISED put confirmations prepared by Lehman per the email attached below.  I received the confirmations by fax today.  The confirmations were revised to provide for physical settlement on the Expiration Date.  There are two different Expiration Dates; one is October 30, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.5246) and the other is December 28, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.6947).  You will see the details on the confirmations.  As Seller of the options, ENE will be obliged to pay Lehman upon delivery of the shares if the options are automatically exercised on the Expiration Date(s).  Please note that there are also changes to the confirmations with respect to "Regulation M/Tender Offer Event" appearing on page 4 (i.e., Cash Settlement will apply instead).

<NAME/>:  please verify that the confirmation changes conform to your discussions with <NAME/>.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.  <NAME/>

That is a close call.  Has he already called on the acquiring company?  If so, then I would think it would be ok.  If not, I don't think that he could contact his friends who used to be at Novarco simply because they were acquired.  That, to me, would violate the spirit of the affidavit language, particularly if Richardson still will do business with the acquiring company through Novarco.

We could revisit this once the dust has settled after the acquisition to see if that approach still is warranted.

Competitive Threats

Northern's competitive position is bolstered by the presence of (1) long-term agreements, and (2) a configuration of small-diameter branchlines with multiple delivery points that function as an extension of the LDC's distribution system.

Minnesota:
?	Northern's major Minnesota customers have contracts that extend through 2007.  Beyond current contract terms, there is a mid-high possibility of bypass in Minneapolis/Twin cities area (Alliance, Viking or Northern Border); low-medium bypass possibilities in Rochester and Mankato, MN (Alliance).
Iowa:
?	Northern recently extended the contract with its major Iowa customer (MidAmerican) thru 2005.   Beyond current contract terms, Northern will face competitive threats from NGPL in the Des Moines and Sioux City.

Wisconsin/Chicago:
?	With several significant contract terms up for renewal in 2003, Northern will face competitive pressures in the Wisconsin and Chicago areas because market prices are below maximum tariff rates and due to the high concentration of competing pipelines.   To some extent these competitive factors have already been recognized, as Wisconsin Gas has already bypassed Northern via Great Lakes.    The distance of competing pipelines to many Northern towns will preclude bypass for many others.  

<NAME/> competitors in the market area include:
?	Alliance
?	ANR Great Lakes
?	Natural Gas Pipeline
?	Northern Border
?	Trailblazer

<NAME/> has worked one 8 hour shift in a year... not exactly pounding the hours and the way the stock is going she might need to put together a few more shifts than that.

How much longer for school for you? ... I know you will do fine!!

All in all things are going pretty good, work is OK, pretty busy myself.  

What have you guys been up to? Traveling sure sucks now...  How is Bryn?  

Are there anymore Canadian E&P Co.'s left... it seems like they have all been bought up by U.S. Kids?.. how is the House? 

I noticed Anandarko... wrote down $ 464 MM because of their Canadian assets... could that be the Berkley indigestion?

PUC and <NAME/> Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates
The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California <NAME/> (<NAME/>) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit <NAME/> filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore <NAME/> to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling <NAME/> to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:
?	<NAME/> will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and <NAME/> have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt <NAME/> had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.
?	<NAME/> will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If <NAME/> has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether <NAME/> will pay a dividend in 2004.  <NAME/> is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since <NAME/>'s annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, <NAME/>'s shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.
?	<NAME/> will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  <NAME/> commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.
?	The PUC can direct <NAME/> to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the <NAME/> debt. 
?	The PUC agrees not to lower <NAME/>'s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.
?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable <NAME/> to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if <NAME/>'s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. 
?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over <NAME/>, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.
?	<NAME/> may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.
"This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for <NAME/> to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California," said <NAME/> Lynch, President of the PUC.  "The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers."
This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by <NAME/> against the PUC, in which <NAME/> claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, <NAME/> will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal.

This is what we have to look forward to.  We need to get all post-id's, for the live and bankruptcy books, and get those to Sanjeev Gupta to dump into excel.

Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft by this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are checking travel schedules for <NAME/> Luce and <NAME/> Y. to see if we can catch both in <NAME/> sometime next week.  <NAME/> Piper suggests a meeting with all origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:

Gas			<NAME/> Vickers (East)
			<NAME/> Luce (Central)
			<NAME/> Tycholiz (West)

Derivatives		<NAME/> LaGrasta

Power		<NAME/> Duran
			Ozzie Pagan
			<NAME/> Baughman
			<NAME/> Shuckley 

Portland		<NAME/> Calger

Calgary		Ladain

Mexico		<NAME/> Y. 

When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy and <NAME/>.  I also want to share this info with <NAME/> Shults and his EOL marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with <NAME/> Mrha and <NAME/> Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  

Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you would like.  --<NAME/>

Hi Mrs. Traylor,

Obviously things have been a bit chaotic in our family life as we try to get <NAME/> ("<NAME/>'s new adopted sister) settled into our routines.  We have been trying to keep <NAME/>'s routines as normal as usual, including bedtime and homework time.  While he seems happy with school, I have noticed decreasing marks on his homework and practice tests.  This especially concerns me with respect to his math -- where he has always been an excellent student.

Do you have any suggestions to help <NAME/> with timed practice tests?  Do you recommend any particular classes (Kumon, etc) or workbooks?  If you think it is appropriate to meet to talk about <NAME/>'s progress, I could come to school anytime this Friday, February 1 for a conference.

Why are energy stocks down so much today?  My only guess is because outlook for NG prices is lower...follows your theory of our price being proportional to NG price.

<NAME/> International purchased all of Com-<NAME/>'s gas and coal plants approx. 2 years ago and now sells the output of these plants back to Com-<NAME/> through 2004.

The operators of the plant are threatening a strike and it could have huge implications with plant availability until replacement operators could be found.   I would like your group to closely monitor this situation and provide me daily feedback.

Contracts cannot be assigned - its that simple.  They have to be offered out to market under an auction like structure just like everything else.

Thanks for your help on all my stuff.  Everything should be set up just like April 11.  Its in the system as <NAME/> SIQ for both companies, and the 10301 DIQ for Peoples only, No DIQ for NS.  This could change slightly in the morning, but my guess is it won't.  I already balanced out <NAME/> Co and Other City gates and took 72000 to Peoples.  Kelly needs to buy at least the short at amarillo.  Thanks again and I'll check with you in the morning to make sure everything is ok.

Ridota's a tough customer.  Very political type--knee-capper from the <NAME/> administration who was involved in the conflicts between Fessler and Knight, large customers and utilities, etc.  DA and Dereg done right (i.e., California never de-regulated) sound good.  May want to add the great job <NAME/> did at locking a generation of Californians into $46 billion of contracts.  Maybe, on the energy issue, Riordin wants to look like a statesman, saying that if he were governor, he'd get everyone to the table to settle this thing once and for all--law suits, bad DWR contracts, ensuring customers have choices.

Sales to PGE:

10/3	After you put in the lending for this day, I agree we are still out by 150 mw.  Its down to two schedules; can you check to see what you show for the Montana buy/resale.  This should be 32 peak everyday.  The other for the day is our pge system to grizzly this should be 26 mw peak.  You have the correct number of MW's coming to us but not going to you. 

10/5 & 10/6   You show 200 more llh....I don't know why????

10/8	The 200 mw you show llh should be a total of 256 (32 llh due to colstrip).  Call me to go thru the hourly at your system to find our 2 mw descrepancy.  You have the correct number of MW's coming to us but not going to you. 

10/9  You show 8 mw @ 24.20 under To BPA-EPMI RP-LS-MC account.  <NAME/>'t know what that is?  You also only show it on one side??

I'll send more when i get thru it!!

It is my strong belief that Kiodex will be most successful in marketing to Fortune 500 corporations. These companies have extremely large portfolios of derivative products to hedge various financial risks but do not view running a risk management system internally as core. I am interested in your thoughts, and how, if you agree, we can influence the company in this direction.

<NAME/>,

Here is the pricing information on the DTN feed.  I recommend that we sign a 3 year agreement so the initial fee of $1,000 will be waived.

The minimum DTN fee is $500 monthly (for up to 25 users) plus $60 monthly for the 1st user and $12 monthly for users 2-25.  Do you want to see the real-time feeds?  It looks like the total monthly fee will be $620 for six users.  

Please let me know if you have any concerns, otherwise, we will implement ASAP.  Also, there will be no additional cost to have this on the 13 floor and move it to our final destination (there used to be a large fee for moving locations).

We are in the process of cleaning this mess up. <NAME/> Beck and <NAME/> Herndon are both given power of attorney to sign confirmations and they are both officers of ENA, so they can already sign documents.  Go figure!  If it's not too much trouble for you to verify those who should be removed then I can double check against my list.  I don't want to remove someone who should be left, nor do I want to leave someone on who should be removed.

Thanks for your help.

P.S.  For timing purposes, we are shooting for Monday to finalize documentation.

I'm not sure.  A couple of theories:  refining capacity is limited because of environmental barriers to new refinery construction;  second, in the absence of government subsidies I think ethanol is uneconomic (and with continued low crude prices and an antisubsidy mentality in Washington, it's unlikely to get better soon).
 
In other news:  <NAME/>'s mom called last night.  Francis is dying.  He was slowly going with congestive heart failure and now has renal cancer which has spread to his liver.  He has had a great life and is well into his nineties.  He is mostly sleeping now and <NAME/> will be getting a hospice nurse today.  <NAME/> seems fine (this has been coming for a while), but of course no one is ever ready.  He has stayed himself to the end:  when <NAME/> was helping him get back in bed after he had fallen, he told her:  "I don't think we"ll be having sex today."

<NAME/>,

1.  We can include the sithe agreement in the master netting agreement although we do not believe that this will work for Dynegy as it is not a forward contract but an annuity stream which cannot be accelerated, however if they think it works - fine.  We would not want the margin calculated net (it needs to be exclusive of this transaction).  If they were to convert to two swaps in order to allow for acceleration in the master netting agreement, there is an accounting issue for us.

2.  In the East we are long physical power from them in the markets which are not pools.  We are short to them in the pools which clear financially and we have no issues in the pools.  So we do not need to do anything.  I'll have the west soon. 

3.  We will have our physical gas position by point soon.  We will agree to prepay for all of Dec but we should only pay day by day.

Dale,

I can reserve 2 to 2:30 time slot  but there  is really not much that
I can tell you at this point.

The commercial groups are still interested and are moving 
towards the test of the package.  As soon as they will decide
to move ahead, we (Research) shall be involved, helping to evaluate the 
product. As I have  said, we are not the 
decision makers in this case. 

I think that we should allow simply the process to run its course.

There have been a number of letters sent dealing with "questions" on our license.  Govt Affairs is concerned that this will be voted down by the PUC given everything that is going on with the company and our incomplete record.  We would recommend that the agenda item be removed this week and we deal with the outstanding issues.

<NAME/>:
To explain the P&L of -349,000  : 
We executed the trade when you gave the order (the delta anyway), first thing in the morning.  The market rallied 8 cents from the morning, with the back rallying about 2.5 cents.  On 904 PV contracts, curve shift was -226,000.  The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and vol.  Cal 3 straddles, for instance, are $1.39 / $1.45.

Looking out for you bubbeh:

Our marks are fine (at least through 04 where we occasionally see #'s).   I don't think it's appropriate to shut down anything.  We need to price the product properly and off-peak needs just as much margin as on-peak given the increase in coal prices and the effects of load growth.

Rather than shut down products, increase the price to reflect the current risk in the market.   We are chipping away at our off-peak position day by day and we have bought some NYMEX coal.

Am I making sense?   In addition, I am working with <NAME/> to buy 7x24 from FPL in North Texas (for both desks).   We will probably have to pay $3.50-4.00 spread to get 3-5 year 7x24 deal done.

With respect to NE, the outright prices are much higher and resid is the marginal unit for off-peak, therefore, in some ways the risk is easier to manage.

<NAME/> Kaufman and I met earlier this week with Gov Geringer of Wyoming.  He is supportive of a single RTO though it is not clear that he favors a FERC mandate.  He will wlso be pulling together a small group of Western Govs to meet with <NAME/> Wood to discuss the negative impacts of FERCs refund and rate cap proceedings on Western power markets outside of California.  He has asked us for two things (which I believe <NAME/>, <NAME/> L and <NAME/> are working on):

Agenda and briefing paper we would propose for the Govs meeting with Wood
A "white paper: describing the burdens placed on western markets as a result of the price cap and refund processes.

Like most Western govs, Geringer has little tolerance for federal mandates but he is very well informed on energy issues, favors open markets and is very interested particularly in seeing the western power grid opened.  Geringer will also be participating in Bingamin's "panel" on or about Oct 9.

I'm on my way to <NAME/> tomorrow.  I've sold the <NAME/> cabinets, but not the TV cabinet. (Still working on it!)  Some people have finally shown a bid for my house but its a little less than I really wanted to sell it for, so I'm stalling.  I've pretty much sold everything else I own except for the knick-knacks.  I have to come back in a couple of weeks and take care of actually moving everything and collecting the money.   I'll be sure to keep you informed when I know more.

<NAME/>:
Here is my analysis of my guys:
<NAME/> Maggi (2) : P@L for first half a bit misleading.  Up till today, he has run and taken the P&L for 7 days.  3 days were in the first half of the year and 4 in July so far.  Running EOL is a law of averages...some days you get killed some you do well.  The second day he got massacred: T boone sold 3000 contracts as well as the floor selling on an illiquid day followed by gap down the next day.  P&L for that day was -$7.  the four days in july have been really good, probably +$6-7.  So I look at his P&L for the first half of the year as Jan 1-Jul 6.  That P&L of $15 is around my expectations.  runs low var.  pretty good at running EOL when I'm not there.  A little too reactionary but hopefully more experience will help.  makes most money in market making, probably slighlty negative in greeks and negative in curve shift.  Would like for him to turn both of those positive.  A bit hadicapped because present format doesnt allow him to fully get physical info.  Required to spend all time in front of computer.  needs to develop <NAME/> Griffith to allow him to get off the desk more.  good contrarian trader.  often has opposite position of floor.  willing to stop out and is nimble.  needs to take more of a macro view of vol rather than ending up with everybody' elses positions.  Vital for me to have him as a bbackup right now.  Cannot function without one of us on the desk. 
Computer causing problems.  will email with other guys later.

The commission suspended Direct Access effective September 20th.
The decision orders the utilities to stop accepting DASRs for contracts executed after 9.20.01.
But astonishingly, the language in the proposed decision states that the Commission will take more time to consider whether the effective date should be pushed back to July 1.  In short, that battle continues.
How the Commission will proceed in continuing to consider retroactivity is uncertain at this time.
The Commission held over until its next meeting the decision regarding the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC.

<NAME/>, from what I am hearing, we will not get into the 6th floor to show the staff around ( prior to the move in).  I still think it would be timely for all of us to get together for a drink but in light of this small logistical issue we may want to postpone until we move in and then go out next week. 

Once things settle down ( assuming they do) I look forward to talking specifically to you regarding increased initiatives on our parts to ensure we are getting everything we can out of marketing and trading efforts.  It is my observation that we have not made the progress I would have liked in terms of information flow... and although there has been progress, there is a ways to go. This probably has as much to do with individuals as it does anything else.

Looking forward to those discussions.

Although we expect to receive specific feedback on our July 6, 2001 proposal to Pemex for the TransPecos Pipeline very soon, we sent the attached letter today to Pemex (with a copy to Kinder Morgan) that will withdraw our proposal on October 1, 2001 if the LOI has not been executed.  

Kinder Morgan has agreed with the sending of this letter.  Pemex has been aware of the contents of this letter since Monday, September 17.

We will keep you posted of our detailed discussions with Pemex as they proceed.

Thanks,

<NAME/>,

<NAME/> Slone has been in contact with you on my behalf about a clerical error that occurred when I tried to roll my remaining ESOP shares into the 401 K plan back in the August to September time frame.  She indicated that there may be reason to believe that I will be reimbursed for this error but you were waiting for further information on the matter.  Given that I will be going with the sale of the trading business to UBS in early to mid February, I wanted to get this situation cleaned up by then if at all possible.  What steps do we need to go through to get closure on this matter?  Is there anything I can do to help (ie. explain in person what happened)?

Any explanation that you can give as to how and when this error gets fixed will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

<NAME/>,
 
This recipe is from my Paris cooking class.  It is supposed to be wonderful served chilled (when we cooked it in class, we served it warm).  Be careful not to add too much cream since chilling it makes it a little thicker anyway.  Also, after you puree it in the blender, <NAME/> <NAME/> (our cooking teacher) recommends that you strain all of the chunks out with cheese cloth. She says the reason for this is so that the guests will have a harder time figuring out all of the ingredients.  It is part of the Parisian mystery of cooking.
 
Good Luck!

<NAME/>, 

Sorry about the brief first reply things have been a little busy. What is with people (that article) ? Working long hours just for the sake of working long hours. I am pushing for a 4 day work week. 
Why Calgary? Why not? I love Calgary. Actually the guy that ran our trading operation in Calgary is getting married to an American who works in <NAME/> so he is moving to accommodate her career. This has left a hole in our Canadian operation and my boss felt that I was just the cork to fill that hole. I think it is a promotion. Besides, <NAME/> in the arm pit of the world. This city has few redeeming features. What it lacks in culture and sophistication it makes up for by its lack of clean air and any form of natural beauty. Actually, it isn't that bad. <NAME/> has good restaurants, decent night life and the people are really friendly but given the choice I would much rather live in Calgary. In this business odds are that I will find myself back here sooner than later so might as well enjoy Canada while I can. 

<NAME/> got engaged. Good for her. I have a cactus in my bathroom that is dying from lack of attention. I am not engaged. I was seeing someone for a while but she took a work assignment in Venezuela. No big loss. Too old for me anyway (31). 

Glad to hear that you are enjoying you time in NY. I am going to have to visit some time. I know I say that every time we chat but I really would like to try to get down there before you move on to your next destination. Or is NY home for a while? 

No Vacation plans other than that I am going to <NAME/> and Jen's wedding this weekend. Should be a good party and I hung out with those guys quite a bit when I was living in Calgary. Also I am going to look for a place to live in Calgary in Friday. My friend <NAME/> from TO is moving to Rotterdam to do his MBA so I might try to visit him in the spring. Do a little Amsterdam, Paris, London whirlwind tour.

My family is doing great. My dad sold Titan to a Comglomerate from the US and is retiring in January and my mom is up to the same stuff. Dancing and buying shit for their house. Both of their health is great. My dad has been playing lots of golf and feeling great.

How is <NAME/> doing? Is she in Australia now? I should get in touch with her. I saw Reagan Neiss in commercial for her TV show last night. Good for her. I hope all goes well for her. <NAME/> did go to D's wedding. Said it was really nice. Still don't get that one? 

I have to stop writing now my fingers hurt. Keep in touch.

<NAME/> -  Anywhere that we have Supplier Consolidated Billing <NAME/> put up some form of credit to cover 45+ days of Utility charges.  So while I am unsure of the form of collateral, if <NAME/> provides a list of where we are doing Supplier Consolidated Billing, we should be able to construct a Collateral Obligation worksheet.  We also have collateral in each ISO (NE-ISO, NYISO, PJM, CAISO).  

It will take some time to de-DASR to Dual Billing and until our accounts switch, the Utilities will hold the Collateral.

<NAME/> --

Let's talk.  

We are arguing against NERC, but <NAME/> needs to understand that something must be in its place. We have a policy that we are supporting - giving reliability to FERC - and that is <NAME/>'s approach.  Have you communicated that to <NAME/>?  

Also, on RPS and energy source reporting, I agree but this may be a part of the final package.  Also, the language I read allows the FTC to construct a process that makes it possible to not use day ahead markets.

Per <NAME/> Lavorato, we killed all desk to desk deals on Dec. 13th.  That is why this deal was killed.  You mentioned that you had price deals that were not killed.  Can you give me deal numbers for those as well and we can take a peak and see why they were not killed.  It is our understanding that all desk to desk(book to book) should be killed because no cash actually changes hands.  Should this deal have been with an external counterparty?

I left you a voicemail as well.  I just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that it appears the ESOP rollover into Savings Plan ocurred as we discussed last week.  I got into the Savings Plan on Friday 11/23 and moved the <NAME/> shares to Stable Assets also as we discussed.  It appears that the price used was Monday's close of $4.01 instead of Friday's close of $4.71.

So where do we go from here?  I am assuming per our previous meeting that whether $4.01 or $4.71 is used; that one of these prices will be used to keep me whole versus a price sometime in September (probably September 30th) when the ESOP shares should have been put into the Savings Plan.

Please call me at you earliest convenience to resolve this.

Thanks,

Great news.  Are there any other MD Commissioners that Ms. McDonald thinks we should visit with?  

On the idea of NYISO vs. PJM, I was reading in Restructuring Today yesterday about some elements that NY thought was better than PJM.  I think that we need to "find" three things to give to the NYISO in the development of a single market...allocation of FTRs comes to mind.  I agree that PJM and its staff are the key elements, but maybe getting over this rhetoric will be made easier if we concede that NYISO does something well??

Should we do another round of New England meetings to push our support - with McGreevey winning in NJ, will the NJBPU change its focus?

Presto got some info the Calpine got a great price on their power sale to California.  Are we negotiating with California and will they agree to credit terms that we like.  It seems like we are going to sell to someone who is going to sell the California.  If this is true we should evaluate the margin vs the credit and legal risks.

Assuming that our bid's stay in the range discussed previously, what are we going to do? 

I am not going to hard trade the buyers at this point until we know for sure Suncor is there.. 

So, can you pls advise. 

I would suggest we get Suncor to give you a "Stand Still" for the rest of this week which includes a firm number ( or better ) that they will sell capacity for. By the way, this number needs to be close to zero as there is not much left over.


Current economics.... approx $400,000 Bid on the table, plus ENA holds option Apr 02 - oct 02 to put capacity to buyer.  Under this structre Suncor keeps capacity until Apr. 02. There are no liquids conversations being conducted at this time and pending structure may not be.

None of the financial markets support premium payments ( for any term ). 

Give me a call.

Canada appears to be an issue.

We need to make swift progress on this - unlike in the US the contracting entity with our counterparties will not be UBS AG, London Division but UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd.  With the lack of parental company guarantees forth coming from UBS, this is going to be an issue.

There are two main points, because of our current history our customers will not contract lightly with a subsidiary with no guarantee and secondly the credit group are asking for guarantees from our customers.

Please let me know how we can progress on this.

<NAME/>:

I do have comments to this confirm.  I have never seen your ISDA Master Agreement ("Master") so you need to have your lawyer review some portions of it to eliminate the possibility of conflict.  

(1)	Is SunTrust the Calc Agent under your Master? Should they be agent for this deal?

(2)	Need to upgrade definitions to 2000 Definitions (the 1991 and 1998 Definitions have been superseded!)

(3)	Are you in agreement with the optional early termination language and all calculations being performed by SunTrust in the manner set out? There is no valuation or payment time/date for this termination or details for giving notice of intent to exercise the termination option.  This language is extremely vague but perhaps you do not mind.

(4)	Do you have existing transactions with SunTrust on your books in addition to this one?

(5)	Are there any Additional Termination Events under the Master?  You don't want to necessarily eliminate such events from occurring.  Also, it is not clear to me if this transaction or any other derivative transaction with SunTrust is "related to the Loan Agreement" for purposes of giving SunTrust the right to terminate.  Is it?

(6)	Defining an "event" as either an "Event of Default" or a "Termination Event" has different settlement consequences.  It looks like you're not concerned as to how SunTrust values terminated Transactions if this deal is "related" to the Loan Agreement. I think part 2(d) would be clearer if stated as:

"Additional Termination Event will apply.  The following shall constitute an Additional Termination Event with respect to the Counterparty: (cite events (i) and (ii) if accurate) .  For the purpose of the foregoing Termination Event, the Affected Party shall be the Counterparty."

This means SunTrust will calculate as if you were in default.  Or do you want to calculate at mid?

(6)	You should delete Par. 2(a).  I don't believe you have agreed to do this in the past (but perhaps you do not mind).  Your lawyer should review the impact of stating "This provision shall constitute an additional Agreement for the purpose of Section 4 of the Swap Agreement."

(7)	Are the economics of the deal stated correctly?

(8)	What Transaction(s) are being superseded?  Has anything from the initial deal been left out that should be retained?

The following representations (among others) have been made to various parties in due diligence relative to both the credit agreement (with the banks) and the Preferred Stock Agreement (Dynegy) to the Boards of Transwestern (TW), Northern (NNG) and <NAME/> Transportation Services (ETSC) and it subsidiaries, as well as to Dynegy and the banks:

The funds that are being loaned out of NNG and TW to various entities and the further loans of these funds to <NAME/> will carry <NAME/> Corp guaranties.
The note agreements will reimburse NNG, TW and ETSC and their subsidiaries for their actual expenses associated with these endeavors.
The credit agreements actually require a large degree of separateness and an arm's length standard needs to be applied to dealings between ETSC and its subsidiaries and <NAME/> and the rest of it's subsidiaries.

Before the funding under the credit agreement takes place I would like to make sure that you two are aware of this, have agreed to and understand the conditions and further agree that you will assist me in cleaning up whatever documentation needs to be cleaned up between <NAME/> and ETSC and it's subs to make the above representations not be false.

TW currently owns a section of pipe called the Gomez lateral located south of TW's West Texas #2 compressor station.  The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.

The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.  

Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .

TW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if:
	1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or;
	2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.


Items to Verify:
 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral
 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking)


Opportunities for TW:
By Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.  This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.

A lunch has been scheduled with <NAME/> Allard from Pioneer on Wednesday 2/20 if you would like to attend.

The ESCA energy management system (EMS) in an industry standard software package to provide control area services and energy accounting in compliance with NERC standards.

<NAME/>,

As a follow-up to our conversation last week I have tried to get the list of mills from PPPC but they are not responding to my requests. There is another way to compile that by using Jacobs Sirrine database information.

Second, I changed the inventory sheet to reflect the latest NORSCAN inventory number that I got from PPPC and so the forecast for October changed a bit, more in line with the historical average now.

Let me know what you want to do on the pulp mills's list and also anything additional in the inventory forecast sheet.

Claudio,

I agree with you. The first bullet point will be easier to implement. Generally I have found that there is sufficient divergence of opinions amongst wholesale players that you can get positions on that you want. 

My goal would be to fulfill the function of both bullet points. I think there are pockets of risk management of complex relationships around the firm, but no group dedicated to it. Clearly we will need quantitative rigor to serve those functions.

questions: I am familiar with Quantos from my banking days, where a USD interest rate option pays off in a non USD currency at a fixed exchange rate. What is the specific structure of the options you are looking at.

Regards,
<NAME/>

I don't think there would be any problem with the ECS selling the gas to a third party.  They are currently selling the gas to ENA.  I am not sure how the proceeds from the sale will be handled once ECS recieves them, since ECS is not bankrupt.  I will see if I can find anything out about that.  <NAME/>, you might want to check with <NAME/> and see if he has any insight.

<NAME/> --

Do we have a strong preference for what DSTAR utilities should do?  I think that we want to communicate with OMTR and others at FERC to push a single RTO in the West (leaving CA) outside.  Also, having the Transco originally within the RTO West makes alot of operational sense and should not limit the economics of the Transco.

Hi, Robbi!

Thought I'd e-mail you rather than call and interrupt you.  How are things going now that <NAME/> and <NAME/> are there?  Hopefully, better.  <NAME/> gave me my review Thursday and I kept a copy of it to show you.  <NAME/> managed to get her digs in, but, fortunately, <NAME/>  saw right through them.

Our contractor is going to start work on our house the week of Labor Day, so we are having to pack as much as we can to move upstairs.  We thought it would be perfect if we could find fabric to recover our furniture so that maybe we could send it out while the construction is going on.  If your offer's still good, we would like your assistance in looking for fabric.  We were hoping to take a day off to look for fabric but didn't know how that would fit into your plans.  Would you let me know?

Also, we need to schedule a lunch with <NAME/> and <NAME/>.  What is best for you?

Talk to you later.

Also, we need to work together to make sure that EES' reports, taxes, and other requirements are filed in a timely fashion (with the right internal groups).

On the IL Bond issue, there must be a disconnect between us and the ICC.  The ICC believes that our Bond isn't current.  Maybe we can figure this out together tomorrow?

<NAME/>,

I am being told that the books and records of <NAME/>'s trading units are on aggregate marked off of a cost of funds curve. I should have that curve to you first thing Monday morning. Sorry about the delay but it is hard to get certain things done in a timely fashion around here right now.

What about meeting around 5:50 - 6:00 p.m. at the <NAME/> Movie Center
on Smith. There is an underground parking between Smith and Louisiana
and the movie theater will validate your parking ticket.

There are several bars at the center.

The movie starts at 7:00 with some boring speeches. Saturday should be more
interesting - it's a comedy day.

<NAME/>,

We are sending our bid and offer prices to Reuters for most US Gas & Power products, as well as European Gas and Power, Crude and Refined products, Bandwidth, Coal, Emissions, Weather and Sea Freight.

We will receive 75% of all revenue Reuters collects from subscriptions to EnronOnline quotes. It is an evergreen 1 yr contract with mutual termination rights upon 90 days prior notice. We are under no obligations to provide levels of service.

Revenue expectations:

Reuters will charge, initially, $150/month/desktop. They have 5,000 Energy desktops worldwide.

thus with 100% penetration we would get 5,000 x 150 x 12 x .75= $6,750,000;

With a more realistic assumption of 50% penetration the yield to <NAME/> would be $3,375,000 p.a.

This revenue does not include the incremental benefits, in our view, of branding and standardization of our product and liquidity in the marketplace. In the future I could see us adding a transactable API to the product through Reuters, which would enhance the ease of transaction by Reuters users.

If you have any more questions give me a call or drop me a line.

Hi <NAME/>:

Congratulations on side-stepping what many (including us) thought would be a summer filled with supply disruptions. We're as glad as anybody that it hasn't happened. 

I have a quick question:  Your consultant for gas procurement, a fellow named <NAME/> Baldwin, until recently did some consulting work for one of our business units, Transwestern gas pipeline.  <NAME/> has informed us that we won't be able to talk to him in his new role due to conflict of interest considerations that arise from our previous relationship with <NAME/>.

With that in mind, I was wondering if there is someone else working on gas procurement other than <NAME/> (who doesn't face the same conflict issues) that we could meet with to discuss providing low-cost gas services to California?  We're very cognizant of the importance of maintaining a conflict-free environment.  But it would be a shame for the state to forego a good gas deal for the state's consumers.  If there's someone we can talk to and avoid (even the appearance of) conflict-of-interest, we'd be very anxious to do so.

Thanks for your time and hope all is well.

Best,
<NAME/>

The 29th is OK for me other than it is NX1 for Natural Gas.  Starting at 3:00 makes it possible but 4:00 would be better or even the 30th at 3:00 would be better.  I am assuming that a lot of thought has gone in to picking this day and other conflicts exist.  The other gas traders are going to have the same issue with this time so if it is the only time that works for everybody then I'll be there at 3:00.

The only issue I have is everytime I login I have some Windows Installer program I have to kill and it takes me an extra 2-3 minutes to keep closing files before I can get into my desktop.

I don't know what caused this, but I am assuming some file you installed is still trying to run.   In addition, the dial-up through Citrix is very very slow.   Is this normal?

Any thoughts?

Commissioners <NAME/> M. Duque and <NAME/> A. Bilas, dissenting:

One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.

We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. 

Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. 

	DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  

	We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. 

For these reasons we must respectfully dissent.

Here's my first stab


Key Findings
1. With only one significant exception, the groups acknowledge their tasks/responsibilities in the measurement process.  The only area that appears to be lacking defined roles/responsibility is follow-through on open issues/corrections that are not made prior to close
2.  The main issues with late data for billing relate to execution and lack of communication follow-through
3.  There needs to be an added focus in the field about how their tasks relate to the NNG billing process.  Current procedures are written solely in the context of calculating UAF.
4.  The customers chart changing arrangements raise audit concerns and concerns about our ability to gather timely data for billing.


<NAME/>

1. Educate field and GMS staff on use of measurement data in billing -- combination of written materials and presentations  (Gas Logistics).
2. Renegotiate chart changing agreements/gain understanding of timing parameters.
3. Assign responsibility for past month issues past measurement close.
4. Develop single point of organizational accountability for quality/timeliness of data fed into PGAS, including Field Teams with respect to their measurement duties; measurement technology, GMS and UAF specialist.

<NAME/>,

He looks like a well qualified candidate but we receive
hundreds of such resumes. The way to
distinguish between different candidates is to ask
the question: Did an individual make an effort
and invested his time to learn things directly  useful
to <NAME/>?

Given our work load, I would not accept a person
who has general quantitative skills but expects that
<NAME/> will train him from ground zero in all other
disciplines. We had recently a candidate who wrote a letter
and complained about being asked questions about
energy economics, finance, etc. during an interview.

We can interview the candidate over the phone and see if he knows anything
beyond math.

Guys,
Let's get together today to dicuss demo. I would like to demo full capability, including option manager. I think it is very important to also set up an interest rate product, perhaps a swap that is quoted in rate only. No need to convert to dollar ox just yet. Given that the guy who is building their commercial paper platform will be there and seems to be one of the main judges of the merit of EOL I think it behooves us to slant presentation that way.

<NAME/>:

Got your voice mail regarding <NAME/> Pescetti running for a FERC seat.  Here are some quick thoughts.  <NAME/> likely has some additional experiences and information to share.  Be happy to discuss further.

Republican assemblymember from the Sacramento area.
Was a member of the Sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature.
Republican (minority) head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that <NAME/> Wright chairs).
<NAME/>'t recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like.
In fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically wold have locked out competition.  It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated.
When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities.
Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up <NAME/>' ridiculous bailout bills in <NAME/> Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition.
And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led.
Can't recall a time that he's been there for us.

I'd be happy to talk with him, but if we need someone at the <NAME/> level to contact him, that's great, too.  Just let me know.
	
Best,

that motherboard does look sweet!  why the scsi drives though?  personally, i want to find a RAID card that can handle RAID5 (everything i've seen is 0,1,or 0+1) and then link up a bunch of smallish IDE drives - if the controller is good, you don't need super fast and expensive drives, so you get speed and redundancy.  as i look at hardware, i can't believe how much enron was paying compaq for hardware - it's amazing.  as for parts, what do you think about ordering from the cheapest U.S. source and paying duty?   

coffee or lunch would be great.  supposed to be big news about the enron auction today, but things are very slow and i'm more or less available any time - whenever you're next in town, give me a buzz, or if you're looking for a reason to come into town, how about tuesday or wednesday -- lunch or an afternoon coffee?

I have received the revised W-2 forms from <NAME/> that increases my reported income to reflect my non-eligibility to participate in the dependent daycare spending accounts.  (See letter in the package of information that I previously delivered to you).  Evidently <NAME/> failed the test for providing dependent day care benefits to highly compensated employees.  I will fedex the revised W-2 forms to you.

I will be in <NAME/> through Christmas, and can be available by cell phone on Thursday and Friday this week, December 20 and 21.  I will be in New York for several days following Christmas, from December 26 through December 28.  

Tomorrow, I will send you a contact list for Mid and Back Office Operations for the remainder of this week and the week of Christmas.  That contact list contains my hotel number in New York, if something critical were to arise while I am out of the office.  

I had provided you yesterday with a list of IT and Operations personnel to be included in the meeting to be set with <NAME/> Saeger regarding the process for handling terminations of transactions and arriving at the residual value of deals non-terminated deals in the risk books.  I have not seen a meeting scheduled yet, and as you can see from the memo that I sent you yesterday, many risk book administrators will begin their vacations around Christmas this week.  If you still plan to hold the meeting this week, please notify my assistant, <NAME/> Valdez (x39106) and I will try to join in by phone.  

I hope that you and your family have a great Christmas.  I will see you back in the office on December 31. Feel free to call me in the interim either at home or on my cell phone.  --<NAME/>

(ii) the Rockies Power - prebuild, I am not entirely sure what this deal is - but there was one in Washington.
(iii) REmove MidWest Gas Utility Outsourcing as we haven't completed this yet - hopefully you can have it for Q4.
(iv) Price Risk Management is your call - its really just trading.

DWR filed comments with the California PUC today urging the Commission to adopt a July 1 suspension date.
In addition, DWR takes the position that, if the Commission does not enact a July 1 retroactive suspension date, the Commission should require that all customers who went DA after July 1 pay a proportionate share of the bonds and DWR going-forward contracts.
Customers and providers will strongly oppose DWR's proposal at the PUC.

<NAME/>,

My apologies for not getting back sooner, but I sort of wanted to see how the <NAME/> real-time products did before proceeding with this.  It seems like real-time is a success, so let's get going with this. 

I call this product DART (Day-Ahead/Real-Time).  It's basically a physical product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on real-time.  For example, on the day-ahead, lets say I post a "US Pwr Phy Firm  Mid-C Peak Oct04 to Oct05 DART"  $27 at $28.  If I get hit, then the party selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct 5th, real-time 25 MW each hour.  I would be long real-time at $27.  If a party lifts my $28, then I would be obligated to deliver to them on Oct 5, real-time, 25 MW each hour.  I would be short at $28.

The mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transaction.  The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow such that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions that needed to be prescheduled.

As far as the product language goes, I think if you add the following language to what you provided below, we should be OK (obviously subject to legal review).

"This product is intended to be transacted on a Day-Ahead basis, for delivery on a Real-Time basis.  Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day of delivery, consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices.  Real-time means the actual Delivery Day.  Real-time deliveries shall be consistent with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices."

Take a look, give me a call.  Thanks.

Skyline refers to added seasonality that NNG proposed to add to its rates.  The rate case settlement represented a compromise approach to shifting more responsibity to the peak.  So no we didn't implement Skyline as proposed and nothing is pending.  I expect that NNG will make a new proposal to refect peak cost responsibility as part of the next rate case

<NAME/>,

You could probably add expected capacity projections to see how Asian capacity will change in the future both in pulp and paper and compare that to let's say other areas of the world. I remember that in the RISI conference the speakers were saying that Asian pulp capacity increase will lag behind that of Latin America but their paper capacity will probably explode so they will major pulp buyers.

Anyways, you can find the capacity expansion data in the PPPC website. Let me know because I have some printed copies too.

Hey:
1.  Theoretically we could agree upon a trade and cross it on ICE after hours when the risk that someone else gets inside is remote.  This is a prearranged trade and is illegal on Nymex, but it is my understanding it will be legal on ICE assuming ICE uses the IPE clearing platform, where prearranged trading is legal.   Agree about liquidity.  I dont think this really helps ICE's volumes, nor liquidity.  Funds want liquidity so they will not flock to ICE in the current state.  
2.  My guess is not intercommodity, but maybe intracommodity.  For instance, a gas daily swap against front month futures may have lower margin than the 2 trades additive.  

Important Note: ICE is our competition and I am very,very wary to support their system, unless absolutely necessary.

I hope you feel better. I have seen the message from <NAME/> in which he confirmed
that he approached the Research in <NAME/> on his own. He did not
receive any encouragement from me and from <NAME/>. I hope this closes this issue.
 
I can understand <NAME/>'s motivation but don't endorse the way he takes to reach his goals.
He hopes to accomplish more in a larger group where he can have more interaction with his peers
who have similar backgrounds. I think also that he developed an appreciation for good interpersonal 
relations in my group he could observe during his stay in <NAME/>.
 
My advice is to try to figure out how to use his skills for <NAME/> and how to develop his social
intelligence.

Folks:
Here are my edits.  For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline.

They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions regarding "spot market service" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as "an option to elect."  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it is a "backstop," in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer must choose Term or Direct Access Service.

Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any "stakes in the ground" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with <NAME/>.

In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., "what to do about DA in the interm?"  There may be better ways to craft the language, but I took a shot nonetheless.

Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, do that at this time.

Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to <NAME/> for her patience in hearing me out earlier).

Best,
<NAME/>

While I think the law actually works that way, we have avoided putting it in writing so far.  The way the web site works, the decision to accept or reject the offer happens almost instantaneously so the question is almost meaningless.  The time we care is when the internet slows down or the connection goes down and they don't see that we accepted their offer and then they try to get out.  I guess the other question would be how do they withdraw the offer?  The website doesn't provide a mechanism for that.  If we say it has to be in writing and delivered to the relevant trader, in practice it might not be an issue.

Here is my two cents...

From your message I understand that the tree trunk is entirely on our property and branches 
overhang the condominium fence.  If so, then the tree belongs to Ashford.  

The condominium probably has the legal right to trim branches up to the property line, but may not go on
our property or destroy the tree.  

A landowner is generally not required to trim its tree unless it knows the tree to be dangerous or the tree is
obstructing a public road.   A landowner can't be negligent unless they have legal duty to do something.  Since
the condominiums concern appears to be aestetics and not safety, there doesn't appear to be a "negligence" issue.
Further, a landowner isn't negligent for natural conditions such as a tree falling onto others property during a storm 
unless the landowner knew the tree was unstable prior to the storm.  

If the condominimum choose to sue the church for failure to maintain the tree, they would have to do so on a "nuisance" theory arguing that thetree interferes with the use and enjoyment of their property.  Still to prevail on a nuisance theory they would probably have to argue that the tree was dangerous.

Bottom Line:  We don't have a responsibility to trim the tree, but it seems sensible to let the condominium trim the tree so that issues don't ever arise later if a storm blew limbs down.

<NAME/>, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As <NAME/> indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it! 

Any thoughts.

<NAME/>,

Good to hear from you.  Things down south seem to have taken a turn for the worse.  <NAME/> keeps making headlines, and not in a good way.  It looks like the market is going to test the big E and make sure that we can handle a little adversity.  Life down here is ok, I am still trying to get settled.  Living with the girlfriend is going pretty well except for the two cats she has.  I can not stand them, and if I could find a way to make them disappear I would.  Cats are the most useless, dirty animals in the world and her cats prove it everyday.

Anyways, I've been doing some fun things down here.  I have gone to a couple of college football games.  I saw Texas AM crush Notre Dame, and the University of Texas kill Colorado.  Both, games were fun to go to and the weather was nice for both of them so I can't complain.   I also went to the Grand Prix of <NAME/>.  That day was also nice and it was fun to watch, but as far as car races go it was not that exciting.  The winner lead start to finish and no one was close all day.  The two Canadian drivers both crashed relatively early so even trying to cheer for people from the homeland didn't go that well.  Other than those few days the weather has been pretty uncomfortable.  Hot and sticky, its like sitting outside and watching the rodeo.  You just don't feel clean when you get back inside.

Trading has been hard.  I've been on a long cold spell and I need to turn it around soon.  But, it always looks its darkest before dawn......bring on the light. 

I hope everything is going well for you.  Sorry to hear the ladies are not plentiful.  Usually that is one of the big upsides to going back to school.  Good Luck on you exams, I'm sure you'll do fine.

Jamie --

Thanks for the external view on legislation.  I agree that most of the bills don't "get it right" - the hope is that the FERC can do that without too much legislative guidance (which of course would be wrong).  Not sure that setting up a new federalism on this will ever work - not enough $$ to states to get them to overcome the political power of the utilities.

Hi Baby,

The movie sounds good, nice and creepy! I am going to leave here around noon again ( such a slave ) and go home and work on packing. I can meet you at work or we can leave from the house when you get there.

I love you, I can't tell you how my heart leapt for joy when I saw your face again. I just wanted to hold on to you forever. Those 2 romps were not bad either! ;)

See you tonight, hope you get it all built today.

Love,

<NAME/> --

I will be traveling back from CA tomorrow so I can't make the call.  Some things to be aware of --

1.	EES/EEMC v. SCE Complaint

We filed Aug 30 before the CPUC asking the CPUC to re-instate our customer net bill amounts.  <NAME/> Dasovich will call <NAME/> Fielder to try and see if there is anything that we can do without litigating the case (or at least delay until after legislative session).  If complaint moves forward, SCE will probably consolidate the complaint with earlier disputes.  <NAME/> is preparing similar filing for PG&E, although we need to seek Relief from the Stay.  

2.	California Legislation

SCE MOU bill (that includes DA issues) moved Aug 29 through Assembly Energy Committee.  Needs to go to Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.  Hertzberg is trying to get out by weekend or early next week.  By removing the conservation easements, the bill has lost some liberal Democrats.  Governor <NAME/> is asking Business to find 15+ Republicans to move the bill.  Trying to modify (1) surcharge effective date to Sept 1+ and (2) get more comfort that SCE will pay our Negative CTC if $$ exists.

Also, the Windfall Profits bill has moved through Assembly Committee.  It has to go through Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.  <NAME/> Thome has prepared a synopsis that is attached.

 

3.	AG Subpeona / Sen Dunn Subpeona

Litigation about both Subpeonas was heard this week in SF and Sacramento.  <NAME/> Kirby believes that he may have swayed the Court in the Sen Dunn to provide a protective order.  A final decision may be issued next week.

4.	FERC Refund Case

<NAME/> presented its "ripple" claim earlier this week.  Range of refunds (non-netted) is very large (please see <NAME/> <NAME/> for exact $$).  I have also attached a calendar of both cases prepared by <NAME/> Comnes.  Oral testimony is being prepared in PNW case for next week.

 

5.	NE RTO Mediation / SE RTO Mediation

Both proceedings come to a close this week with an expectation that the ALJ issues a recommendation next week (or soon thereafter).  Looks like the best date that a large number of parties can agree to for a single NE RTO energy market is Nov 03 (PJM thinks it can happen by May 03 but wants some cushion).  <NAME/> Novosel is trying to best position us vis-a-vis the other stakeholders to drive it earlier.  Also, ICAP and control area consolidation is not considered at this time.  <NAME/> Nicolay believes that the ALJ will recommend moving toward a PJM model.

6.	CPUC Decision to Suspend DA Retroactive

<NAME/> <NAME/> continues to push the CPUC to remove the retroactive date in the current Proposed Decision.  Some rumors that the CPUC will again delay a decision until Sept 13 (confirming so please keep close).

<NAME/>,

My suggestion is to have the offsite to be social in nature.  I am sure that many of these people do not know each other and an environment where the group can mingle and enjoy some fun activities would be a great way to become more familiar with each other.  If we must have meetings/presentations, have them done by outside speakers so the group does not have to prepare presentations.  As far as where to go: <NAME/>, San <NAME/> or Galveston are nice and will be reasonable for a group this size.  If you are ok with spending more the golfing, fishing and Spa activities in Florida (Miami, Key West, Tampa/St. <NAME/>) are great.  Also golfing, rafting and Spa's in Colorado would be good too.

I don't have a strong preference for where we go but I do believe that people would appreciate a focus on fun and getting to know each other.

I've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL legal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, but I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.

It's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For example, let's say Morgan <NAME/> agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but that it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forward to real-time, Morgan <NAME/> has two options.  They can buy from us on EOL, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical power, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a position to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it would provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead position.

<NAME/>, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would appreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we need to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contract language and EOL mechanics.

Thanks.

website is Benelliusa.com
	
Recent pricing on two models is:

Benelli Sport (removable vent ribs) for serious competitive shooters is $1145.  This model is very similar to the Montefeltro.

Montefeltro (I shoot this one) with wood stock, 12 gauge, 26" or 28" bbl is $845.  You can also get the M1 (same as Montefeltro but with black syn stock) for same price.  Both shoot 2.75 and 3 inch shells.  Both come with 5 choke tubes.

Let me know if you have further questions.

They started dating about a year and a hlaf ago and got engaged about 6-7 months ago.  She is very nice and we get along just fine.

I am forwarding this message to you sent to me by <NAME/> Superty.  <NAME/> is the director of Gas Logistics for <NAME/> Americas, and attended the lunch meeting that I held yesterday.  I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on things that could be done to improve employee morale.  I can always count on <NAME/> to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request.  Here are his ideas.  Some of these I can orchestrate for my operations team and the broader <NAME/> Net Works employee base.  Some of these suggestions could impact a broader base of employees.  I would be happy to lead any or all of these efforts on an <NAME/>-wide basis is you think that would be appropriate.  I could certainly use some help, however.  

You may already have a venue for this, but maybe it would be a good idea to put together a small team of interested individuals (like <NAME/> Superty) who could make suggestions in the short run on ideas that could improve employee morale.  Not a formalized committee, and not even one that would have to be announced or publicized.  Just an ad hoc group to make a difference now.  Maybe this doesn't have to be corporate wide.  Maybe each business unit could put together an ad hoc group, if they feel that it is appropriate for their business unit, and maybe these various ad hoc groups could just share ideas.  This might be even more effective with buy-in and initiative from the business units, rather than the feel of a corporate overlay.  As I am typing, I am thinking that maybe we will pilot this in <NAME/> Net Works and simply share what we are doing with others.  

Your thoughts?  --<NAME/>

This will just be Rome and <NAME/>.  Although we believe that most of his claims really are against HMS, his lawyer is claiming that <NAME/> used HMS to defraud Rome.  His lawsuit will be against only <NAME/>.  Therefore, it makes no sense to drag HMS into this at this point (although they probably will have to be involved in some fashion after suit is filed).

There is a file under Netco for all currently unused books, rolls and hedge strips.  O:\erms\erms_adm\netco\unused books.  Rather than deleting these, they will remain here until they are needed.  The NGP&L will link to these, once they are needed we will start saving it to the regions file and the links will be updated.  

There is also a hedgestrip saved for each book to the live and unused books files. 

We should also start creating a common file for each region to post the P&L to the website.  Let's try to keep these the same format.  East has a good file that shows new deals and     curveshift.  West used a macro to pull in finished P&L's instead of updating links which eliminated some problems, Randy could help with this.  Figure out what format you want and use that for all regions.   I think everyone agrees that we don't want to give them a positions file like in the past, they should use TDS for that. 

I believe the TRV website should be ready to go tomorrow so we can set up the users and report #'s then.

 God Finally Gives Shout-Out Back To All His Niggaz <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/head_god_gives_shout-out.gif>


      SOUTH BRONX, NY-The Lord Almighty finally responded to nearly two decades of praise in hip-hop album liner notes Monday, when He gave a shout-out back to all His loyal niggaz.

 	   <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/god_gives_shout_out.jpg>	
Above: Rappers Method Man and Redman give big ups to God (inset). 	

      "Right about now, I want to send a shout-out to each and every nigga who's shown Me love through the years," said the Lord, His booming voice descending from <NAME/>. "I got mad love for each and every one of you niggaz. Y'all real niggaz out there, you know who you are. Y'all was there for me, and it's about time I'm-a give some love back to God's true crew."

      "All y'all niggaz, y'all be My niggaz," the Lord added.

      As of press time, God has thanked nearly 7,000 of His niggaz, including those in New York's Bad Boy and Ruff Ryders posses, the No Limit soldiers and Cash Money Millionaires holdin' it down in New Orleans, Nelly and the whole St. Lunatics crew, Busta and the rest of the Flipmode Squad, His peeps from back in the day, and all the real ruffneck niggaz in lockdown. He also sent shout-outs to everybody in the Old School, as well as to Lil' Bow Wow and all the other new niggaz just coming up.

      "Mad props to P. Diddy, <NAME/>-Z, DMX, Lil' <NAME/>, Mystikal, <NAME/>, Ja Rule, Jadakiss, Trick Daddy, and Xzibit. And one love to Meth, RZA, GZA, Ghostface, and the rest of My real niggaz in the Wu-Tang Clan," the deity said. "These My beloved niggaz, with whom I be well-pleased."

      Now nearing the 48-hour mark, the Lord's first-ever reciprocal shout-out shows little sign of slowing down. Based on estimates of the number of rappers who have thanked Him in liner notes over the past 20 years, hip-hop experts say the historic shout-out is likely to continue through early next week.

      In addition to rap's current stars, God offered shout-outs to the original hip-hop heads, including such pioneers of the art form as Grandmaster Flash, Busy Bee, <NAME/>le <NAME/>, Jazzy <NAME/>, Kool Moe Dee, Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Red Alert, the Cold Crush Brothers, Fab 5 <NAME/>, <NAME/> Blow, Kool Herc, and the Funky 4+1.

      God also offered shout-outs to the many DJs, record labels, magazines, TV shows, and radio stations that have tirelessly supported hip-hop over the years. Among them are Def Jam, <NAME/> Boy, Jive, Roc-A-Fella, Rap Pages, The Source, Right On!, The Box, Funkmaster Flex, <NAME/> Lover and Dr. Dre, WBLS 107.5, KISS-FM, and Hot 97.

      "For supporting the many artists who have supported Me so faithfully, I say thank you," God said. "All praise to <NAME/> Harrell, <NAME/> Simmons, LaShell <NAME/>, and everybody else at Uptown/MCA for making this possible."

  <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/god_gives_shout_out_jump.jpg>	 	
Above: A pair of shout-out tablets handed down by the Lord. 	

      As a further sign of His love for the hip-hop community, God assured the nation's rappers that He is taking good care of all their peers currently with Him in heaven.

      "Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Eazy-E, <NAME/> LaRock-some of y'all niggaz are already up in this bitch," the Lord said. "For those of you who were left behind, know that the Lord has got your dead homies' backs. <NAME/> [Evans], I promise I'm taking real good care of your Biggie. He resting in crazy peace, no doubt."

      Thus far, God has not played favorites, thanking such fallen-off acts as Hammer and Vanilla Ice in the same breath as vital artists whose careers are still going strong. The Lord has also seen fit to thank the little-known likes of Baby Tragic, DJ Phreek <NAME/>, and Da Ill Collector-MCs so obscure that virtually no one within the hip-hop community has heard of them. All rappers, God explained, are equal in His sight, and none are too small to escape His notice.

      "God sees even the smallest sparrow fall," said Dr. <NAME/> West, Harvard University professor of African-American studies and philosophy of religion. "The same is true of MCs: Whether a major superstar or a complete unknown, all rappers are His children, and He loves them all."

      The sheer volume of names notwithstanding, the nation's rappers are deeply touched by God's gesture of tribute and appreciation, with many stating that they "feelin' Him."

      "God is the Original," <NAME/>-based rapper Mos Def said. "The world is ruled by the wealthy and the wicked, but all respect due to the Creator who made this world and who will one day bring justice to the wicked and righteous alike."

      Despite the overwhelmingly positive response among rappers, the Lord is drawing fire in certain circles for His use of the word "nigga." On Monday's <NAME/> <NAME/> Live, conservative activist Rev. <NAME/> Butts, a longtime ally of the Lord, blasted Him for His "shocking, unexpected use of the racially loaded N-word." Some concerned parties, including decency crusader C. <NAME/> <NAME/>, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and members of the San <NAME/>-based What About The Children? Foundation, are calling for a boycott of church services until God issues an apology.

      Reacting to the controversy, many in the hip-hop community are rushing to the Lord's defense.

      "The word 'nigga' means different things depending on how it's used and who's saying it," rap legend and Public Enemy frontman <NAME/> D said. "Judging from context, God obviously wasn't being derogatory. He was using 'nigga' as a blanket term of affection for all His true supporters on the rap scene. At one point, He said, 'I wanna give a shout-out to Ad-<NAME/>, MC Serch, and my man <NAME/> The Automator-all y'all is real niggaz in My all-benevolent sight.' Considering the fact that Ad-<NAME/> and Serch are Jewish, and the Automator is Asian-American, it's clear God isn't talking about race here. He's just paying respect to all those who have paid respect to Him."

      "God's the ultimate playa, so naturally He's going to have some haters," rapper Ice Cube said. "But these haters need to realize that if you mess with the man upstairs, you will get your ass smote. True dat."

Rakesh mentioned that there is an additional conditionality that will result
in an adjustment of our valuation of the restrictions imposed on the forwards going
into the Raptor vehicles.

We were not aware of this conditionality at the time the project. 
We can, however, easily, incorporate it in our valuation model.
This omission makes our valuation more conservative
form the <NAME/>'s point of view.


Please, let us know if this is required.

Obviously, coordination with gas and power fundies (rika imai and chris gaskill) is important for almost all projects unless confidentiality is necessary given the nature of the project scope.   My view is No. 1 is part of Rika's core day to day world.   No. 2 and No. 4 are more special project in nature and this is a gap you could help fill.

I will be out Wednesday through Friday so we should sit down tomorrow.

<NAME/>, why does Puget have credit concerns with us?  It was my understanding that we had a MTM of $50 MM in which they were out of the money.I thought the risk was realtively short term. ( winter Gas).  You would think that they would be fine with loading up on <NAME/>. Irony comes in all shapes and sizes when a LDC doesn't like our credit!!!! 

With regards to a meeting.... I have yet to make my way up that way, and would still like to make that tour which includes Puget, Northwest Natural, Cascade etc. 

I think that a meeting with these guys on a consolidated risk management plan would  be ideal.  I will call you today.

I will send the legal names to <NAME/> to get these moved today(with 7,000 lines, I am afraid it would take at least a day for risk to move manually).  We will then recheck the book tonight.  As you will see on the summary page, the total value of these deals is $(61.6M).  If there are any questions, please let me know, I will bring hard copies to the 11a.m. meeting.  Thanks.

At this time, I do not believe that this is a legal issue.  <NAME/> <NAME/>, in Executive Compensation, approves all terms and conditions of VP employment agreements.  Before we agree to modify any non-compete, there must be buy-in from <NAME/> first.  Only then would we consider the request from the legal perspective.

dear elissa-

it's great to hear from you and i'm pleased you thought of my on your christmas list.  it seems like we started to get in touch awhile ago and then i think i dropped the ball.  oops.  i hope you are well and happy new year to you too.  i am still working for <NAME/>, a company you have perhaps read about in the news recently.  things are ok with that for the moment, but i don't really know what's in my future.  probly know more soon.  i live in calgary (did you know?) and have for the last year or so.  i like canada very much.  much more than i expected, although it is very cold here.  mostly the people i like, especially but not limited to all the comely young women.  

are you still in NC?  are you going to make <NAME/> a respectable man anytime soon?  

i got back from almost three weeks vacation yesterday and am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that, since i do very little all day.  i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  

i wish you had sent one of those genero-grams in your holiday card so i would know what you're up to.  send a note when you get a chance.  

also, if you can think of it, reply to trycooper@hotmail.com as i'm better at keeping in touch from home.  

one big hug,
cooper

<NAME/> --

FERC has already filed a policy statement providing for cost recovery of "security" upgrades assuming they are reasonable.  I know that the Bush Admin will now have the response as its top priority.  I think that it will take a couple of weeks before we really understand the implications for further energy reform.  FERC postponed announcing its Work Plan this week but my guess is that Chairman Wood will continue down his course.  

Retail competition in different states was already under fire from the California situation.  Not sure if this week's events will have any major changes.

Thanks.

I spoke with <NAME/> about your proposed changes and he was okay with your first change, however,  the definition of "Investment Policy" does appear in Section 5(c)(i).  What documentation sets forth your investment objectives, restrictions, etc.?

Also, do you have any comments to the forms of guaranty agreements attached to the ISDA?

Finally, we are awaiting copies of Quark's documents, those of its Manager and those of any other relevant entities so that we can review them and verify that there are no issues that would require delivery of a legal opinion.

Thank you for your assistance.

Hi, <NAME/>!

I look forward to meeting with you this week when I visit NEPCO.

I wanted to alert you to an OSHA investigation that was served on us here in <NAME/>.  Specifically, an employee named <NAME/> <NAME/> claims that he was fired from  his job in Jenks because he complained about unsafe conditions there.  OSHA has sent a request for information, as it is going to conduct an investigation.

Have you heard of this?  How would you like to handle it?

We can discuss in more detail on Thursday.

On point #1 - I think that at the end of the day, FERC will not deal with the Negative CTC directly.  All they will do is reset prices.  The Utilities and the CPUC will then have to decide the legality and the equity of modifying the PX Credit and hence the Negative CTC.  We have tried in the CA Refund process to highlight the fact that much of the "high" prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the CPUC, Governor, and Utilities.  The core problem with this line of argument is that the Refund process didn't ask the first question - what or who is to blame.  It simply took dysfunction and ran.  We are trying in the context of the Rehearing case to ask FERC to restart with the right question.  Also, remember that we aren't going to have a solution in the FERC case until sometime next year, probably after SCE gets its money.  Finally, I think that the right policy decision is not to "re-bill" Negative CTC but rather to prospectively recover the costs.

On point #2 - See point above.  I doubt, however, that all "high" prices can be seen as just a result of underscheduling.

One other thing -- Texas law will apply to those employees in Texas, as state courts will not allow other laws to govern in employee matters.  Oregon is the same.

FYI - I spoke with <NAME/> Sturn yesterday and he is coordinating the pigging of the SJ lateral to see if the efficiency of the drag reducing agent will increase.  He says the pig run will not interrupt scheduled flows on the pipe.  If the efficiency of the SJ lateral does not increase from the pig run, then Operations will look to reapply the DRA.

As you guys know the 2003 PGT expansion plans are supposed to be 230,000/day. The landscape of the shippers list is ever changing... Rumors of PPL pulling out 85,000/day to Malin and Stanfield is unconfirmed ( we are trying to validate)... and potentially Avista pulling out as they have been downgraded... they hold 35,000/day in 2003. Combined this is almost half of the planned expansion. 

Although not confirmed the bottom line is as the 03 shippers back out the expansion it becomes compromised and ultimately I believe the 2002 expansion and 2003 expansion start to blend together. As you guys know the 2002 shippers lists of 211,000 / day is made up 2 shippers Calpine 35,000/day and Newport Gen 175,000/day and this expansion has it's own issues.  

As we know more about shippers moving around I will pass on... pls do same.

Let's get some time tomorrow.

Essentially although there is still a long way to go and nothing is certain,  <NAME/> has decided that <NAME/> will run a group including Market Risk, Credit Risk and Research.  Things are too early to know whether you will report in only in that way or also directly through their credit departments which was certainly a preference of one or two of the bidders.

As discussed yesterday, we will have a 5:00 pm meeting daily to update you on details regarding the merger.   We will begin this meeting today, Novmeber 13, and will continue this as long as you find it useful.  The meeting will be held each day in ECS 04075 (same conference room that we were in on Monday morning).  

<NAME/> Taylor will join us from Legal this afternoon. He will discuss terms of the merger agreement and will answer questions that you may have.  We will also discuss our ENW plans for a PRC "Lite".   

There is no need to RSVP to this meeting each day.  The meeting will be held daily for all of those who can attend.

<NAME/>,
 
I was thinking that since I do not have enough time to prepare the appplication process, it would be a good idea for me to fax the recommendation letter forms to you first so you know what to expect and maybe start writing. In the meantime, I will mail those forms as well as envelopes because you have to retunrn those to me. The envelopes would have to be signed across the seal.
There will be a total of four schools that I am applying to.
   1- Yale
   2- Boston College
   3- University of Massachusetts
   4- Bocconi University (Italy)

Attached are forms of resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage agreements, together with a form of authorized traders list.  I don't know if <NAME/> told you or not, but we typically require two signatories to open brokerage accounts.  Presently, our resolutions reflect <NAME/> Schultz, Vice President of Risk Assessment and Control Group, a Division of <NAME/> Corp. as being authorized, however, we have just learned that she hasn't been officially elected to this office, so in the interim, we will have <NAME/> Buy be our second signature.

I tried to call you last night around 6:00.  I was unable to leave a message on your home machine or cell.  Really nothing too pressing but Schonne is wanting to follow up with us on our plans.. I did talk to him and told him not to assume that our PGT capacity will go to NEWCO, because NEWCO does not really exist and may never... SO, I told him to review  the tariff and make a determination as to whether or not it is still ours to use, if it isn't, then we don't really need to talk.. it they determine it is still ours, then we need to think about what the estate should do with it, including the upstream parts.

I will mail the checks and money to <NAME/>.  There was one other item that I was going to deliver to you.  One of the women who had prepared snacks for the last general meeting turnedin the recipe for her pumpkin dip.  She said that many people were asking her for it, and if we had room, maybe we could publish it in the newsletter.  I told her that we would have to see how much official material we have from the chapter and if we wind up with a needed "filler".  Let me know if you do need a filler, and I can send the recipe via an attachment.  Feel free to call me at work - 713-853-5926.  I have the recipe in my briefcase. 
 
Glad <NAME/> got back to you on the food drive - or lack there of!
 
At fall regional training, I attended a Communications session - they provided a list by month of desired national information (from the national website) to be included in our newsletters.  Had planned to drop that off as well.  I am still at home right now, but I can fax that to you when I get to the office a little later.

Talked to <NAME/>.

First thing he has to do is convince <NAME/>' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals.
He should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR.
I told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs.
He said that he'd be happy to do that, once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the Governor's office.
He's going to get back to me to set up a meeting; and if I don't hear from him by Monday/Tuesday of next week, I'll call him back to set up a meeting.
I'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting?
I asked him what sort of deals they're working on. As you likely know, some of the contracts permit DWR to either 1) provide gas to the plant providing DWR power under the power contract or 2) manage the plant's fuel supply.  So they're looking to get "soup-to-nuts" supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option.

10-4.  I saw a picture of <NAME/>'s deer, pretty nice.  someone from BLM told me a deer came in from the sandhills east of town that was 29" and non typical.  I also heard of some deer that were taken north of town that were pretty nice also (16-24"). Dont you think it s funny that we spend all kinds of money and time traveling to all our secret spots and the big ones are right in our back yard?

 Im planning on taking some time off for the holidays, so If I dont hear from you have a wonderful Christmas and keep your focus on the Lord, He's our only salvation.  So often we look to other things to give us security and joy and we so often forget, that for those that love Him and have confessed Him as our Savior He is our strength and hope of a future eternal glory.....May God be your source of strength, <NAME/> Christmas...

I am not sure if <NAME/>'s Food Service department manages the Starbucks but you do I would like to report a continuous problem.  Starbucks has always charged a premium price for a "premium product".  Recently, the quality of the coffee served downstairs has been miserable.  Very often the coffee that they serve is burnt and you can tell just by smelling it.  It tastes horrible and I know it isn't just me because about 5 or 6 people who sit next to me have all had the same conversation about how the coffee is always burnt.  Today, I bought a large coffee and by the time I returned to my desk took the first sip and it was horrible.  I went back to the lobby and told the girl it was burnt and she smelled it and agreed.  Then she gave me a new cup that was supposed to be fresh brewed.  It was just as bad.  It tastes and smells horrible!  Something has to be changed because the quality of the coffee doesn't deserve a price of a $.25 much less over $1.00

A few thoughts before the NG meeting --

1.	Maybe we should (as a team) call Transelect (<NAME/> Buckman) before our NG meeting.  You may remember that Transelect sent an initial letter into Skilling to try and solicit our support for stopping the NG application to be managing member of the ARTO.  I think that it would be good to call Buckman and ask if he has a better idea than NG.  We are right now stuck between two very bad answers - let AEP and FE construct a managing member or have NG.  Maybe Transelect has a better solution.

2.	Chief Issues with NG --
a.	are they "really" independent?  having a short position in NY and owning generation in NE effectively makes NG into a "market participant" - I think that <NAME/> should make as a hold firm position that to operate an RTO there can be no agreement with anything less than almost perfect independence.
b.	who do they feel the customer is?  maybe we want to get <NAME/> <NAME/>'s take on their business model from the UK.  it is critical that the new RTO operators across the country view traders/marketers and generators as their key customers.  what form of regulation for cost recovery of their operating expenses do they want - pass thru, PBR, etc.? 
c.	who writes the tariff?  I would make a strong argument that the problem with most of the RTO work to date has been that FERC has allowed the current incumbents to first write a bad tariff and then assign the provision of service under that tariff to someone who has very little (if any) control over future changes.  the RTO operator must be free to make changes to the tariff with only two constraints - (1) must not restrict the ability to pay facility revenue reqts and (2) must not damage the assets.  
d.	do they intend to build/own transmission and how does this impact the energy markets?  will their planning and construction processes impact any long term positions that EPMI may take in the energy market.  how do they manage to allow other merchant transmission into the business?
e.	how do they intend to provide balancing energy?  the flip side of our fight on congestion management involves the pricing of energy imbalances.  what is NG intending to do on this issue?  does NG believe that multiple control areas makes sense for a single RTO?  does NG support unbalanced/uncovered schedules day-ahead?  

Also, just to let people know, Kerry Stroup will also be working on the Midwest RTO efforts going forward.  Please keep him included on the e-mails.

3.  Ameren Energy Fuels and Services Company, as authorized agenf for and on behalf of Central Illinois Public Services Co. (d/b/a AmerenCIPS)

As I discussed with Joe Deffner, the <NAME/> transaction we recently completed (loan in a commodity deal), we were unable to get the "exception language" for collateral.   We did the transaction at LIBOR - 10bp and even when we add 65-75 bp for the cost of an LC, the transaction still provided a competitive source of cash.

The confirms we sent incorrectly placed the "exception language" and I am correcting that today.

I did confirm that Dow is now an asset deal with no interest by Dow in ENW products.

I think we should look at what everyone else charges per commodity (i.e. ICE) and think about tsomething that is at least 50% of that. and it shuold be labelled an access or system maintenance fee.

A bit of good news: NGPL has confirmed that they would like to do a 2yr product hosting deal on EnronOnline.
$150K initial startup plus $100K per year and $25 per transaction. So total value not including per transaction is $350K. I think they get 5 products, but Forster knows the details. It's a start and the crew here is pretty pumped.

I'm trying to get a lieutenant of Viol'a to work with but it is hard. <NAME/>.

Let's meet on Monday to talk about what we were going to do on Friday.

I am in the office picking up some Stro's tix. It sure is quiet for a Saturday...creepy.

I hope that I didn't come across too strongly just now.  Our budget is again under fire by the business groups and I want to try and do everything we can to create value for the businesses.  

I appreciate what you are doing on this.  Thanks for everything.  I understand the bind we are in with timing and the importance of getting this report in to FERC.

And the food.....well it was awesome.

Thanks again.  <NAME/> you are feeling better.

Can you please advise as to the payables policy of DWR. For example, if I were to sell you gas via <NAME/> Online for the month of November, would DWR be paying that invoice on the 25th of the month following delivery? 

Is there any possibility that this could get paid on the 5th of the month following delivery( at least in the beginning).

Further to our conversation of the other day, we have compiled some information on political contributions by other corporations.

Please see attached spreadsheet.  As you will note, energy companies are already heavily slanted to the Republican party (as are Pharmaceuticals for the most part).  The interesting one is the financial sector, where contributions are more evenly split with one (Bank of America) heavily slanted to the Democrats.  Have a look and let's talk.

I have heard recently that EES is signing up customers in Texas that "passes thru" congestion.  There may be some billing and settlement issues given ERCOT's systems.  Basically, we will not know based on our bill from ERCOT what each customer's congestion was.  I want to make sure that EES billing can determine how to charge this?

Who should I talk with?

I respect the fact that a mistake was made, my problem is that the mistake causes me to have to wait until November 20th to get it fixed.

hey emily,

don't think i can make yoga tonight - i went climbing last night and inflamed some tendonitis i have in my arm so i'm going to chill out for a few days.  however, i have made plans to see the royal t's with dorland tonight - so here's a look if you haven't already seen it.  

and to respond to your earlier email (i can't keep up):
the meeting i had on sunday was fine - it's always good to see what else is out there.  

the pipe and casing industry sounds fascinating - i can't wait until you're an expert and you can hold forth on the intricacies over some earls carrot cake.  and speaking of earls desserts, anything would be better than the gingerbread cake.  also, has earls updated the propaganda on the left hand side of the menu, specifically the "featured ingredients" section?  

not sure when you're going to get this, actually.  

oh, i'm going to a wine tasting at the double mo cafe on thursday night if you/jamie are interested.  do you interested in wine?  my friend craig's wife owns the cafe which is near the university.  i always have fun when i go, so give it some thought if you like wine.  i think it's going to be a new zealand/australian theme.

Congratulations to everyone on making it through Q3 more or less intact and a big thank-you to those who pulled us through with all your hard work.

Given the continued increase in the number and variety of transactions coming to us from the Global Finance and VPP teams, we are going to have to revise our staffing procedures and ask each of the lawyers in the group to take on some of this burden.  If any of you receive a request to handle one of these deals, please refer the requester to me or at least let me know so that we can equitably distribute the load.  <NAME/> and <NAME/> will be scheduling training sessions for the entire group during which they will go over some of the most common structures and the issues that they have faced recently to help us on our way.  As with all of our work, I expect that we will each be available to the others in the group to bounce ideas around and help with thorny issues.

Per our conference call today, here are some ideas to get TW Settlement Value.

1.	SoCal to commit to TW to let us schedule transport at the SoCal/Topock (South Needles) delivery point.

2.	SoCal to turnback 20,000 to 25,000/d of receipt capacity from the WTX Pool, at no cost to TW (SoCal continues to pay for it).

3.	TW has been scheduling PG&E's payback to SoCal at SoCal/Topock to help PG&E and SoCal.  SoCal to schedule this as transport from PG&E/Topock (as a RP) to SoCal/Topock (DP) and pay TW transport fee.

4.	SoCal to agree (in writing) to dedicate to TW the incremental 50,000/d at Needles becoming available Jan, 2002 until Red <NAME/> Expansion in-service.

5.	SoCal to amend their OBA to dollar-valued (from volumetric) and cash-out their existing OBA with TW (at TW's index value).

6.	SoCal to sell storage to TW.

7.	SoCal to purchase incremental Thoreau to West of Thoreau capacity from TW.

8.	Extension of SoCal's mainline &/or San <NAME/> lateral contracts.  Or early notice of termination or early notice of ROFR trigger (so that we would have the opportunity to remarket it).

<NAME/>'t worry with the 11GJ's just as long as we have the proper volumes over here.  Also, leap years are observed in the gas business.  When working out the number of days on excel, if you take the month in advance and subtract the current month it will give the correct number of days (including leap years).

EES - the ENA ones are still on hold.  I really am not concerned about EES and retail.  I spoke to Muller who was hesitant about providing load numbers as he thought it irrelevant.  There is very little left to carve out.

<NAME/>,

Per our conversation, the following table shows four storage inventories that we need to track/compute/report, etc.


<NAME/>

The west desk currently displays storage balances on several of the morning reports.  These balances are not reported by the respective pipelines, however, each day the injections and withdrawals are available.  In the past, our excel spreadsheets have tracked the running balances by simply adding the current daily activity to the prior day's balance.  As we get validation of the balances through phone calls, and/or postings, we tweak the balances to maintain an accurate representation.  Currently, our reporting/storage system does not allow us to make these balances available on our reports.

<NAME/>

Synthesize the currently used method of displaying storage balances for the storage facilities shown on the following table.  It is our intent to have a DRN established (and some already have been created) that would hold the storage balance each day.  However, this requires that a calculation be executed to determine the value to be placed in the database.  One possibility is to have the scraping script make the necessary calculation and store the new storage balance each time the pipeline is scraped.  Another possibility is to incorporate the ability to do these calculations in the report, while a third option is too keep a spreadsheet with storage balances that queries the database for the daily activity.  Lastly, these storage balances could be manual entry points, but would require manual calculation each day (representing a lower level of performance than the existing system for this feature).

<NAME/>

This is a necessary feature before transitioning from the current spreadsheets.  At a minimum, we need to have temporary system in place before the end of the week.  Although, we do not have a final date for transitioning, we see this as one of a few critical tasks.

Attached is the revised Keep Whole Language.  I assume this language would completely replace the Variance langauge that we currently insert in our GTCs and any Replacement Price Differential Language in our Pooling Point and Wellhead GTCs.  I.e. this will be the only measure of damages for these deals.  If this is not correct, let's discuss. 

<NAME/>,  This language would be the same language use for the W&T Offshore and Spinaker deals.  Is this correct <NAME/>?

<NAME/>, I presented a form of assignment to PG&E as recently as 2 weeks ago( including other structures).. Generally speaking, they HATE the El Paso pipe because of it's flow risk and are not interested in discussing this with me until such time that EL Paso deliverability becomes more reliable. 

Having them take this pipe as a vehicle to help offset our bankruptcy claim works from an economics point of view ( assuming you can agree on values), but I think you will have a battle regaring the quality of service that they are going to get. Regardless, it is a an out of the money position for us and we could accomodate if they wish to discuss further. Have <NAME/> or <NAME/> call me if they wish to discuss logistics around this asset.

Regarding the need for the RMT confirms, I have always thought this was really a tax issue and that for audit purposes they were needed.  If that is not the case, I don't object to doing away with them altogether.

We have approved doing away with confirms for EOL trades on a counterparty by counterparty basis.  We haven't actually gotten there with anyone yet, having just started the actual discussions this week.  Our plan was to negotiate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the master agreements where appropriate.  Initially we are only working on physical power, physical natural gas and derivatives transactions (other than weather).  The idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved to insure that all of the bases are properly covered.  This will obviously be a very time-consuming and laborious process.  The initial list of 10 or 15 counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people.  Our conclusion that this was even possible was based only on Texas and New York law analysis.  If any Canadian deals are at issue, we will need to get you involved both for the analysis and the negotiations.

<NAME/> this is helpful.  Let me know if it makes sense to you.

<NAME/>

P.S. -- Please be careful when sending e-mails to me.  There are two <NAME/> Taylors and we're hard to tell apart.  The other guy has his middle initial ("A") in some of the lists and sometimes there is a globe next to his name, but not mine.  My name usually has my phone number next to it.  We're trying to get the IT people to do something to better distinguish us.

Hi There,

What a great e-mail!  I got a warm glow and a great laugh all rolled into one.  I am keeping that one in my palm pilot so I can read it anywhere I want.

I woke up thinking about you, took my bubble bath and looked at my pink toenails thinking about you, put on my lotion thinking about you, drove to work singing along with the radio to Steely <NAME/> thinking about you, and am just about useless at my desk thinking about you.

I really enjoyed just vegging last night.  You have a good day too cutie pie.

I have it in my briefcase, I just forgot to get it out.  Another slow day so far.

I checked on the internet today about FannieMae and GinnieMae per <NAME/>'s comments the other day.  I learned that GinnieMae is a government owned company that buys and sells mortgages for HUD and FHA loans.  They are basically the financing vehicle for these low income housing loans.  FannieMae basically does the same thing but is a non-government owned company (used to be government owned in 1967).  Both entities have had a history of financing the rebuilding of rundown urban areas in cities accross the country.  So <NAME/>'s friend/relative used these entities in the correct way but who knows if there is any truth to their future involvement in our area.  Based on some of the stories I read they tend to focus on really bad areas.  My guess is that on an individual house perspective these two entities provide a mechanism to resale low income housing mortages in the secondary market.  So to the extent there are HUD or FHA loans in our neighborhood they are probably involved in the ultimate financing of these loans but that is it.  I had no idea what these two entities did, kind of interesting.

I'd tell her that we have actual tickets for games on Mar 9 (Astros) and Mar 13 (Indians), but otherwise just plan to buy the day of the game.  We just pulled schedules from the web.

My feeling is that once they affirmatively decide they are going to FL, you should say that I rented a house and that you are going to come over and stay with us for a few days.  I know this might push us to the point of her asking whether they can stay with us .... but I'm afraid the kids will spill the beans.

case 1: Using the Capex of $290,181,156 (which includes the Red Hawk lateral), what does the rate need to be using 100% load factors for 20 years with the terminal value and our hurdle return rate of 15%?  Assume fuel at 0% for the entire term (source of gas would likely be Cal border area storage facilities).

case 2: same as above but load factors as follows:

year 1-2		50%
year 3-4		70
year 5-7		85
year 8-20	100%

We are trying to respond to Panda Energy by Friday 2/22.

I still have not quite cleaned up my affairs in Calgary and probably need to do a weekend trip back up there, but I'll be sure to give you more notice than last time, as it will probably be less work and more play.  I have yet to do anything too spectacular down here.  Last week end I went to the <NAME/> Grand Prix.  <NAME/> Tracey and the other Canadian (name fails me....you know the french guy <NAME/>?????) didn't do to well.  Although, <NAME/> had sponsored a car for that race and it  was in 3rd most of the way until it crashed on the 2nd from last lap.  It was kind of fun to have someone to cheer for in the race that was in the "thick" of things.  The day was nice and it beat being inside all day.

A couple of week before that I watched Notre Dame get slaughtered by Texas A&M.  It was a really hot day and Kyle Field (where A&M plays) is the loudest outdoor stadium I have ever been in.  There was 92,000 people there and 91,950 were die hard Texas A&M fans.  I kept pretty quite though, the only thing I had to cheer about  as far as the Irish was concerned was that they won the coin toss.  Everything else was down hill from there........it was a complete domination by A&M.

The apartment is starting to get organized.  It is hard to take two 2,000 square foot homes and move them into one 950 square foot apartment.  I've thrown a lot of stuff out I hope I wont need again or I hope I can replace easily if I need it.

How are things with you?  Are you guys getting out much these days?  Anything new and exciting going on in your life?

I hope all is well and I find myself missing you guys a lot.  Have one for me!

Mr. Lopez-Velarde:

Pursuant to our conversation attached is the form of guaranty that one of our business groups would like to send to a Mexican counterparty.  <NAME/> has asked if you would please revise the guaranty to provide for agent for service of process, submission to governing law in Texas and submission to jurisdiction in U.S. courts in Texas.  It appears that the form includes submission to jurisdiction in Texas and I have included a provision regarding agent for service of process.

As I stated, we would like to have these revisions as soon as possible this afternoon.

Thank you for your assistance.

<NAME/>:  Attached are four "restated" confirms formerly in the name of ELFI and now in the name of ENA.  I have reviewed the legal language for conformity with the Master Energy Price Swap Agreement and the language is fine. I previously sent you the three ELFI trades that <NAME/> Ng had originally faxed to me.

I am not familiar with one of trades below, No. 923614.  

If you can reconcile these trades, please have executed and faxed to <NAME/> Ng per her message below.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

I have tried to contact you guys three times today and have been on hold each time at least 20 minutes.  I cancelled my service with you over a month ago and asked that you keep from sending me a bill.  My service was cancelled immediately and I was told I would receive a bill from you and I would then have to call and dispute the bill to have my account credited.  I asked at that time since I had waited on hold that time for 30 minutes that this matter be taken care of immediately so that I would not have to call back and sit on hold again for half an hour.  Your customer service manager, very rudely I might add,  said that was impossible and I would just have to do it anyway.  Since I have had to wait on hold today for so long I want this email to serve as my dispute and have my account closed and the balance due removed since you terminated my service and I did not get the use of my phone.  

Just a word of advice, I would hire more customer service representatives if you plan on keeping customer to serve.  This is by far the worst customer service experience I have ever had with a company and I will make sure all of my colleagues and friends know of this experience.  I understand that you don't really care about giving good customer service to your ex customers, but I assure you make a fatal error when you assume those people will not share there experience with current and future potential customers.

Though there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when <NAME/> will call back the California legislature to address the <NAME/> MOU, here's the latest information we have.
Faced with horrible polling, an unwilling legislature, an uncooperative California PUC, and a wily leader of the state Senate (<NAME/>), <NAME/> is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature.
Rumors of a delay come despite <NAME/>' statements that he would call them back next week.
We received the information about a likely delay from an <NAME/> SVP who's working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow.
It's <NAME/>'s view that the earliest <NAME/> would now call the legislature back is end of next week, with early the following week being most likely.
At this point, the chance remains that <NAME/> may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off, leaving <NAME/> to follow PG&E into chapter 11.
In the meantime, negotiations between <NAME/>' staff, and staff from the Senate and Assembly continue.

We'll report back with information as we get it.

Best,
<NAME/>

Good Morning Honey,

I didn't really sleep well last night, so I am tired and cranky today. However, the feeling of RFP is something to grin about. Today I am tying out our February positions with the traders so that they can pre-pay their trades for scheduling Feb 1.  Just spreadsheet and number crunching stuff.  

You are so important to me, I can't hardly articulate how much you mean to me. I love you and am so proud and happy to be yours. I can't wait till we share a home and I am 'out' to my family.  I want to tell them, "this is done" not "this is what I am going to do".  I love waking up in your arms and feeling your kisses first thing in the morning. The sleep thing will work itself out, I am not worried about it.

I am looking forward to forever with you.

Love,

<NAME/>

Hi Dearie,

How are you?  I have been hearing your name more lately, and just wanted to touch base and tell you how much I miss you!  I have been buying that good Prosperity wine at Trader Joe's and always remember the party at your house.

Do you think that you will be ever coming here to visit?  How is your husband?  How is your dog-bite scar? Do you have any new Jewelry?  I am trying to sell my wedding ring, and am thinking instead that I will just get another stone to match the center stone and make earrings.

If you do come to stay, please stay with me. I am signing papers on my new condo this afteroon It is wonderful. 3 Bedrooms, backs right up to a greenbelt with a wetland.

I miss you,

We're now at 31 weeks and the doctor said she wants to induce around 36/37 weeks. 
So we may only have 5 weeks left !!! 

We got all excited this weekend cause we bought a car seat and stroller.

<NAME/> and <NAME/>:

Legal would like to speak with one of you about the "Chase" and "Morgan" issues surrounding the Master Netting Agreement requests.  There seems to be some confusion.  I think the Chase request came from credit and the Morgan request came directly from Morgan.  The items below summarize what I know about the two different counterparties.

(1)  At the request of Chase and with <NAME/>'s approval, ENA terminated the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York Master Energy Price Swap Agreement.  All outstanding trades have been transferred to the April 5, 1994 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement between The Chase Manhattan Bank and ENA ("the Chase Master).  When the merger is complete (anticipated around November 10, 2001), the survivor JP Morgan Chase Bank will be ENA's counterparty under the Chase Master. [See Letter Agreement dated October 24, 2001]

(2)  The Chase Master has been amended several times, most recently to provide for FX forward trades and resolve multibranch issues.

(3)  Chase recently agreed that ENA propose a new ISDA Schedule/CSA.  Legal has requested a credit worksheet.

(4)  Among other things, it appears that the Chase Master currently provides for First Method.  This has never been amended.

(5)  The Chase Master is used for FX/rate and commodity trades.

On a different note,

(5)  Morgan <NAME/> Capital Group, Inc. has signed "mini-netting" agreements with ECTRIC.  Morgan now wants to sign similar "mini-netting" agreements with ERAC and EGLI.  I believe that <NAME/> Viverito is working on these agreements.  Morgan is currently satisfied with its status with ENA but would like to see our Master Netting Agreement and may decide to execute.  Three outstanding ELFI financial trades will be reconfirmed under ENA and I am waiting for Morgan to forward that documentation.

(6)  Both ENA and <NAME/> Corp. have been in the process of negotiating ISDA agreements with Morgan <NAME/> Capital Services, Inc.  Nothing has been executed.  ECTRIC has an executed ISDA with that entity.

(7)  The names "Morgan <NAME/> & Co., Inc." and "Morgan <NAME/> & Co. International Limited" also appear in our database but you can check that out if necessary.

QUESTION:  The Master Netting Agreement assignment list contains the name "J.P.Morgan".  Legal is waiting for direction from credit for preparation of the JP Morgan Chase Master Netting Agreement.  

QUESTION:  Does credit also want to send a Master Netting Agreement to Morgan?  Or should legal merely send Morgan a blank template to see if Morgan has any interest in executing such an agreement?

Sorry for the length of this message but the word "Morgan" raises all kinds of questions.  I hope this explanation helps to identify some of the issues for anyone involved.

Please forgive me for continuing with this, but ENA just told me that they talked to <NAME/> about 90 minutes ago and they had the view that there was still some uncertainty regarding whether Hansen had been included in the 24 contracts.

Firstly,  I never pick up voicemail so I just got your message from the week-end.  Sorry.

Anyway EnronOnline:  There are two versions today - we keep one in NewCo and the Estate keeps one.  Two teams can be allocated for each.
It works - we have enough people to do it.

In terms of the Estate:
The Estate will keep a copy of the source code and the Estate will also maintain a staff on both the development side and the support side in order to ensure the service can be maintained.  The source code and build process are sufficient to allow for running almost immediately.  We actually have two <NAME/>Online environments today - the 'staging environment' and the real 'production environment'.  Essentially we would leave the staging environment for <NAME/> - it is simply a question of staffing which I believe is totally possible now we have allocated the staff to NewCo and the <NAME/> estate.

In terms of NewCo:
EnronOnline will be maintained for NewCo using the production environment.  With its own staff.

No.  We are going up without tickets.  People who have been say there are usually plenty available.  <NAME/>'t worry about the $.  I don't like ND, but from experience, it is better whent the home team wins.  The LSU-AU game a couple of years ago just wasn't as exciting as AU-Florida or Wisconsin-Minnesota.

Greetings Ms Kahl:

Few things:

1)	No, I'm not looking for employment in the face of <NAME/>'s current financial "challenges."
2)	Could you forward <NAME/>'s email address to me?
3)	Are you aware of what <NAME/>'s going to be proposing at the PUC on Nov. 7th w.r.t. how it 	intends to recoup its "undercollection" under its settlement with the PUC.  In short, all  	DA customers, irrespective of whether they were taking from <NAME/> at the time that <NAME/> 	accrued the "undercollection," would be "responsible" for paying.  Which means DA customers 	would pay twice for power--once to their ESP and now, again, to <NAME/>.  Is this something 	that your clients care about?  We care quite a bit.

One of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of this, or whether <NAME/> Wood ought to just be able to push rates around based on briefs only.  We feel pretty strongly that hearings are required.  One of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the iceberg, i.e., <NAME/> will continue on after this in an attempt to force all kinds of costs on customers.  You have a view on whether hearings are required?  More importantly do your clients have an interest in all of this, and will you be there on the 7th?

Inquiring minds want to know.

<NAME/> you're well.  Please don't travel over any bridges.

Best,
<NAME/>

OCC has called me and I am on the call and the operations folks seem irritated with my explanation that I no longer cover communications so I have jotted down the notes on the call and would like to hand over to you as appropriate.

Summary notes from <NAME/> Mertz
-There was an oil spill on the Block 49 platform off the coast of LA in Elod (sp?) Bay on an EOTT facility.  
- Have 2 people on blocks but they are busy with booms (so they are out of communication) and others are on the way to the site to bring up communications.
- The spill was initially reported at 10 barrels.  But later received report that slick reported as 250 ft wide x 1.2 mi long.  And it is nearing the bank/shore.
- Going to do fly over.
- Govt agencies have been called including the Coast Guard. Coast Guard will meet us at site. 
- We have deployed US environmental to do containment and cleanup
-There is concern that news will cover when slick reaches shore.

We have decided to take the curve history with us to UBS for the attached curves.  We have changed the names for some of the curves so column J has additional curves that we would like to bring history.  We will not continue publishing those in the future however.

Cancelled my trip to Vancouver this weekend. Car I was going to look at sold already. How are things going? Married? I am soo glad to be back in Calgary. I didn't think much of <NAME/>. Life has been pretty boring. Looks like things are going to get busy again. Going to be working for UBS Wharburg Energy. A new sub of UBS AG. Should be good. Seems like at great company. AA+ credit will be nice. They have a good risk tolerance and are more or less going to give us limits and let us do our own thing. Hopefully a little more stable than <NAME/>. I think the largest financial instituion in the world should be. Anyway give me a call if you get to Calgary and we will grab some food.

Take care

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

<NAME/>:
Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting (in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from their shop that will be in <NAME/> are:

<NAME/> Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me know if that works for you and <NAME/>.  Or if you'd like to contact them directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.  From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform developed by <NAME/> Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at <NAME/>).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
<NAME/>

We do have a relaunch plan in place which highlights critical timings which need to be met over the next weeks.  I hope this will assist you.  The attached document is a high level outline of what needs to be done between ourselves and the buyer.  

Should UBS be the winning bidder, we are currently planning to use the website name "ubsenergy.com".  If you intend to give us one of your own doamine names please let us know. 

If you have any questions  on the timetable, please do not hesitate to contact <NAME/> or myself, or on the form of the agreements <NAME/> Taylor.

<NAME/>,

Thank you very much for the info.  I have forwarded the specs on to <NAME/> Leach who will be responsible for ordering the fuel oil.  I asked him to identify any spec parameters that are not readily attainable with commercially available #2 Fuel Oil.  For example, I'm fairly certain that 0.0% ash is not normally available.  I have also asked him  to provide information on what grades of fuel oil are available that we should consider.   I will forward any feedback that I receive from <NAME/> to you so we can then have the team determine how best to proceed from that point.

Thanks again for all your help.

How does this look?

 

Also, I did change some numbers in the excel spreadsheet:

	The <NAME/> to Blanco subscription levels were pulling from the row excluding ROFR capacity in the supporting sheet.  I changed it to be consistent with the other 	capacities (which include ROFR capacity).

	<NAME/> had made some assumptions about East of Thoreau capacity subscription, such as, the USGT 400,000/d contract would remain subscribed (it doesn't 	have ROFR) and she had included the extension of 2-3 other contracts that don't have ROFR.  These contracts were then dropped after 2005.  I continued the 	extensions through 2006.

	I changed the East of Thoreau capacity to 750,000/d from 850,000/d.

I thought that you would enjoy reading this article about <NAME/>'s school.  My editorial notes are added in red.  Keeping watching www.houstonisd.org/bushes for when they post pictures of the event.

AWESOME VISIT
On Friday, October 19, President <NAME/> H. W. Bush and <NAME/> Bush visited our school. The Bushes had pledged to match the donation that our students made to the children of Afghanistan. Right in front of the entire student body, President Bush whipped out his checkbook and wrote a personal check for $1, 147.00! The children were very impressed!
The day was fabulous, the weather could not have been better, and our children were stellar! The program took place on the stage in the interior courtyard of the school. Because the weather permitted us to use this area, every student was able to take part in the program and enjoy the excitement!
As the President and Mrs. Bush entered the stage, the children waved paper dollars in the air to greet them. The program opened with the singing of the school song. Carmen Sullivan gave a history of the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag and Kelly Iko (this is our Kelly from Sunday School -- whom I'm sure will be the first minority President of the United States)  led the group in the Pledge. The students sang God Bless America and waved individual flags. Not an eye was dry! It was awesome.
<NAME/> Strange, <NAME/> Liu, <NAME/> Siso and <NAME/> Shallenberger told the group about the effort the Bush students had put forth to collect money for the Afghan children. <NAME/> Reese, <NAME/> Zhang (this is a sweet little girl from <NAME/>'s class) , and <NAME/> <NAME/> wheeled in a red wagon with the students' contribution! The program closed with more flag waving and the singing of It's a Small World.

Sounds like a great idea to do follow-up reviews.  

I have budgeted $2000 a month for travel and lodging on the West RC.  I would prefer you keep it to every six weeks in order to cover me coming up there and others coming down for training.  I think it would be beneficial for you to be able to meet with groups in <NAME/>.  I also only budgeted for $100/month for Overtime/Working Meals so we may have to subsidize that with the traveling budget.

I have not heard anything lately on the video conferencing.  If you don't mind, ask <NAME/> if he has made any decisions on the video conferencing.

Please circ to all of RAC.


I want to thank everyone for their hard work during these trying times. Lots of our efforts in the past building systems, procedures and infrastructure pay off in times like these. Feedback from both Citibank and JPM/Chase and <NAME/>'s Board members has been very positive relative to RAC. Congratulations to all.

On another note I want to caution everyone in the group from making negative statements in the presence of ours and other groups, especially more junior members of these groups. Because they come from RAC they are not considered idle commentary and can be, and have been, damaging to morale to these people. We all speculate about the state of affairs and it is a good stress relief but we can not be a part of morale reducing behavior.

Things are not back to normal but they are improving. Upon receipt of commitment from banks, hopefully later today or early tomorrow, our short term issues should be resolved. Lots of activities are underway to address medium term and long term solutions. In the mean time, keep smiling.

I would offer him the initial contract assuming its what I think it is.  I know that we have base salary issues that we would have to deal with.  I basically told everyone to drop it when <NAME/> proposed his numbers.  Again, the offer to you and him were not meant to be insulting but meant to offer something a year early as we did with a handful of other folks.  We naively thought that these would be accepted quickly.  For everyone else that got offered a re-up a year early, they did exactlty that.  

Let me know if you want to discuss it further.

I would recommend that you attend, I am going to try and attend as well.  THE ONLY CATCH IS THERE WILL BE A TEST AT THE END AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SHARED WITH HUNTER.

I received your name from Kam Keiser.  We are both managers in risk management at <NAME/>.  Kam had mentioned that you are in the process of recruiting for several clients in the energy industry.  I have roughly 4 years experience in the industry with 2.5 of those years in risk management.  Prior to employment with <NAME/>, I worked for a big six accounting firm and in the healthcare industry for the University of Texas.  I am interested in staying in the energy field.  If you think one of your clients might be interested, I would like to send my resume on to you.  If they or you are not interested, I apologize for taking up your time today.  Thanks and I hope to hear from you soon.

We are sending them over this morning.  I have already talked to <NAME/> Matney and told him the agreements were coming this morning.  They will review and we will plan to meet next Mon or Tues to iron out any remaining items (such as the operatorship) so we can tender to Pemex.  

<NAME/> is OK with them and has agreed that if we need to conceded the operatorship, we can, but he would like an opener in three years to re-bid the operatorship.

Here's what I have so far (who are we supposed to tell about this??)

(i)	Broker Margins		
	Approx:	 $50mm
	Availability:	 End of Week
	Probability:	 85%
	Current position (initial margin) $60mm out.  <NAME/> <NAME/> will tomorrow bring a large portion of this back by moving positions to our Paribas credit line (we have a $75mm line 	which we are only using $15mm of).  I am working on the rest, which is spread across various other EGM books.

(ii)	Peoples JV
	Approx:	$135mm
	Availability:	Within month
	Probability:	50%
	We have (i) $10mm in the enovate bank account ($20mm in total, 50:50 <NAME/> Peoples), (ii) $40mm storage inventory and (iii) $75mm in a pre-pay.

(iii) 	Emmissions Reductions Credits (held by West Power).  
	Approx:	$25.5mm
	Availability:	Dependent on whether financing
	Probability:	50%
	If the vehicle is rolled, then we could look to use the additional capacity.  The vehicle will be rolled next week.

(iv)	Mariner - Zero ($2mm in bank)

Deffner's group working on EGM's $400mm and Joe Gold is ready to go with his $300mm.  So that's good, we should be able to get some of this off.

<NAME/>,

I've been thinking about this. I think 18 mos. for the average tenor of a trade is way too high. For <NAME/> <NAME/>'s book it would on a prospective basis be  more in line with 4 months. We would probably not make markets online on anything past 24 months for NYMEX gas and the vast majority of our trades are in the first three months. I think the same would probably be true for power, but I haven't spoken to those guys about it. 

For the NYMEX book gas I made the following assumptions:

Average tenor: 5 months

Average trades per day: 400

average volume per trade: 500,000 mmbtu

average px: $2.7/mmbtu

With 252 trading days you and up with a gross unadjusted notional of $136bn. This is simply 400*252*500,000*$2.7

You then have to adjust down for the expiration of trades during the year. If the average life was 6 months you could halve the number above, which would be conservative given our 4 month assumption.

That takes you down to $68.04bn ($136bn/2).

The next adjustment would be to factor in netting for counterparties. You are trying to estimate the net open interest per countperparty. I am working on those numbers as I write this. It stands to reason that the net number for NYMEX Gas deals would be less than $70bn. When you factor in other gas trades and power the number would rise and I will look at that.

As a basic method, does this start to get you to where you need to be ?

I talked with Lavo and we agreed Herndon and Black should go as well.   I think Zufferli would make 14, but we should be able to squeeze.

I am calling aviation today and I plan on arranging the following:

	1) Plane goes to Portland and picks up your guys at 9:00 am on Friday 6/21 (or 6/28 if more notice is required)
	2) Plane picks up <NAME/> guys at approx. 3:30-4:00 pm (<NAME/> time)
	3) We arrive in Cabo around 7:00 pm.
	4) Plane returns to <NAME/> 6:00 pm Sunday
	5) Plane continues to Portland and arrives around 8:00 pm (Portland time)

Let me know if this works for you guys.

I have verified that ECI, although a non-debtor entity, must have all proposed dispositions of assets or liquidation of positions approved by Ernst & Young ("E&Y").  <NAME/> Hendry's memo of December 20, 2001 contains the phone/fax numbers for <NAME/> Ma who is our contact person.  <NAME/>'s email address is:   cindy.ma@ey.com and her cell phone number is 917-680-7810.

<NAME/> Ma is currently in transit back to New York.  Although she doesn't know who I am, I will leave her an email and voice mail detailing who you are and the urgency of your situation.  You should do the same by email, voice mail and fax.  I suggest a deadline for E&Y to respond to you since I was told in a voice mail from <NAME/> Buggs that any delay whatsoever will frustrate your process for a sale on Friday, December 21.  I am not at all familiar with the details of your proposed transaction but I would alert E&Y to the reasons why you need their "approval" (for which there is no written procedure) immediately or else your "value" evaporates.  There is nothing that I can do if E&Y is slow to respond.  In that situation, I suppose I would keep calling the E&Y New York office to request immediate attention to your situation.  By the way, I was unable to return <NAME/>'s message since I received it about 10 minutes ago and it's very late in the U.K.

Just copy me in case I receive a call.

<NAME/>,


I need to get whatever access <NAME/> and <NAME/> had to AlbertaPower and AlbertaGas databases on dev and prod.

I may already have it, but I'm not sure, especially about the AlbertaGas database.  

basically, their accounts have been cleared from the network and I need to run things under my own account, 
rather than theirs.  

Also, on dev db, I need to admin rights as <NAME/> had these to do some OLAP stuff.  I'm guessing you are not the
person to talk to about this?

Corry,

I would love to start the process of cleaning up the scheduling system.  We will need help from the schedulers as well so can you send Duong Luu their logins and request the 'Zero Volumes' application in EnPower.  There are many people asking about what is flowing and the month is creeping by so if you could get with me tomorrow to make a game plan that would be great.  I think we should have the schedulers send us their spreadsheets with an explanatory and then we, along with Unify users, will come up with a plan.  I hope to use the schedulers in this process as well, let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,

I'd like to keep this confidential, but someone inside PG&E's gas group (for what it's worth) told me that participants will have a choice under PG&E's proposed extension of its Gas Accord.  Either the participant can retain the capacity for the term of the extension (less the cost escalators in the original deal) or release the capacity back to PG&E with no penalty.  I'll try to confirm that this is the view among most in PG&E.

I view the sharing of the fundies databases and associated web sites (gas and power) with the Estate as a serious commercial issue that we should not ignore.   The estate can not only use the proprietary information as a competitor in the trading business, but they could potentially sell the data to multiple competitors.

I can't imagine that this data was agreed to be shared by UBS and the Estate.   I am not planning on giving any of the data to the Estate.   I feel very strongly about this issue and the rest of the commercial organization does as well.   One of the keys to maintaining a competitive edge in this business is our huge headstart in this area.

Can you make the system calculate a killed deal?  There were deals killed with Sempra Energy Trading on Saturday and the credit group needs to know what the value would have been had these deals been calculated against yesterday's curves.

<NAME/>,

<NAME/> <NAME/> and the IT team are currently working on resovling the bad Zone P day ahead and real time data.  <NAME/> told me that it was pulling the PJM data.  

As far as the shift notes go:
I talked to <NAME/> Benson about the shift notes and he said that they have improved greatly.  The PJM summary page is pretty accurate (usually w/in 50 cents of the actual number).  The link for the spreadsheet is:  http://eastpower.test.corp.enron.com/portal/summary/pjmsummary.aspx  .. you might have been using an old version.  

I will continue to manage the Northeast physical book.  It allows me to effectively hedge my long or short position in the off peak market.

<NAME/>'t hate me for sending a note.  What do you think?
"California made two big mistakes:  First, they never made a market.  They didn't deregulate.  They just re-regulated the failed monopoly structure they'd been living with for decades.  Second, when the first mistake led to an energy crisis, California's leaders didn't stop, learn from their mistakes, and get deregulation right.  Instead, they blamed everyone but themselves, including <NAME/>.  Those mistakes led to the nightmare California's been living for over a year now, and they still California still has woken up."
"<NAME/>'s the model of the virtual organization.  Whether the problem's in California, or <NAME/> or Sweden, <NAME/> creates the virtual organization needed to solve the problem.  That's what we did in California.  <NAME/> is definitely the brain, but you need all the other limbs and organs to function well.  What makes the "virtual" part of it work is a committed management team, great technology and an incredible team of talented, flexible folks from across the company.

The letter looks good.  A couple of comments for your consideration:

On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and then argue that we don't fit into it.  Would it be worth explaining why that makes sense?  Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses.  Economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business (eg distribution).  The competitive market can not be solely relied upon to "regulate" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as distribution utilities.  Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service.  What those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers.  The same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive.  The generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relatively low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.).  These components of the power and gas business can be "regulated" by the market with respect to rates and terms of service.  They do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other "retailers" (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions.  Competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service.  Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of service for such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations.  Indeed, the legislation, and the legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale.
As a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative.  But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents have a habit of doing).. .  I can just see the press seizing on <NAME/>'s claim of "ignorance or mistake" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of "prosecutorial discretion".  I suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific reference to "ignorance or mistake", and not plead for the favorable esxercise of PD.  If we feel we need to write about this last item, perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances.

Okay, here's what you're supposed to do... and try not to be LAME and

   it onto a new e-mail that you will send. Change all of the answers so that
   they apply to you. Then, send this to a bunch of people you know
   *INCLUDING* the person who sent it to you. The theory is that you will learn a lot of    little known facts about your friends. It is fun and easy.

   **Remember to send it back to the person who sent it to you.**

ENA had a term supply contract with Energen to purchase roughly 4,485MMBTU a day at 2.60 on MRT, which Energen terminated on December the 4th, 2001.  The operator for the supply, <NAME/> Field Services, erroneously allowed  supply to continue to flow between Dec. 4-31. ENA also failed to remove its nomination for the supply, allowing it to continue to flow to ENA's market, Oneok.  <NAME/> Field Services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ENA the gas at a price of 2.3375 (gas daily average for MRT West Leg). 

I have spoken with <NAME/> Eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ENA receiving and delivering the gas to Oneok.

 I would like to try to get the MRT issue settled as soon as possible, for I feel that it would help facilitate the Centana Storage account (approximately $2,500,000 in positive cash flow). Although <NAME/> recognizes that it has no offset rights for the two issues, they seem to be taking their time.

Kayvan,
 
Attached is a copy of my resume.  Things are very volatile over here so I am not sure what to expect for the next three months, but if possible (and if <NAME/> isn't banktrupt) I would like to stay here until Febuary 5.  If we are around until then, I would like to try to make a choice on a potential job by early January.  Of course if we go bankrupt everything could change.  I would like to come up sometime soon and see what options exist and how I could fit into AEP's plans.  It was good talking to you and I hope to hear from you soon.
 
Thanks,

I assumed we were scaping the "Inventory Chagne" point for PGE, but it doesn't look like any data is in the database.  Can you check on this.  It's the last row of the larger tables on the webpage.  The location name I believe is Inventory Chang.  If it's not being scaped, let's get it started.

Rent Revenge of the Nerds sometime.  And no, it's nothing personally related to me.  

Anyway, this day is pretty much shot.  The highlight was deciding where we were all going to sit in the new building.  We move in November 9th.  Should be pretty cool.  I just remembered, I'm supposed to go to dinner with a bunch of people from the office and one of the brokers we work with.  We're going to a martini bar before hand.  Oooof, I'm going to have to find a second wind.  Must leave soon......

The source sink issue continues to be a huge thorn in our side and costs my group significant $'s every year.   I estimate $10-15 million per year is lost by our cash traders every year due to the inflexibility in the daily and weekly market.

Therefore, we should continue to fight this issue hard to rectify as soon as possible.

Thanks.

Aquila informed us they are about to announce an open season in the next day or so with their partner Southwest Gas on a new storage project near Vegas.  They propose to have 12 Bcf total, 6 B in first phase.  Location is in the same salt formation as Desert Crossing.  They do not have a pipeline attached and look to be hooked into TW and El Paso's north system.  

I am supposed to talk with their development person on thurs about a pipe option.

<NAME/> Utility Rescue-Plan Session Set for Oct. 9 by <NAME/>
By <NAME/> B. Marois 
Sacramento, California, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A special legislative session to consider a rescue package for <NAME/> International's insolvent California utility won't begin until Oct 9., aides for Governor Gray <NAME/> said. 
The governor had been expected to call lawmakers back Oct. 2. His aides didn't explain the reasons for the delay. The governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p.m. San <NAME/> time, <NAME/> spokeswoman <NAME/> McLean said. 
Southern California <NAME/>, California's second-largest utility, accrued $3.9 billion in debt under the state's deregulation law, which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise. Some of the utility's creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy. PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, filed for bankruptcy in April. 
The Legislature adjourned Sept. 15 without approving a $2.9 billion rescue package, prompting <NAME/> to announce he would call lawmakers back to Sacramento to consider a new plan. 
The latest <NAME/> measure may let the utility sell $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion in bonds to pay off its debt, secured by existing rates on about 20 percent of its largest commercial customers, <NAME/> aides said last week.

try having no work to do for two months and then having to stick around and "appear" busy...  i know what you mean, in some ways its harder when you're not used to not doing things.  i've gotten good at finding things to do with my time, but when i first had nothing to do, i was going crazy.  fridays are always slow around here and i'm guessing its the same there, although i don't know cnrl specifcally, oil and gas producer/marketer?  

in terms of what i do, before enron went under, i was the short term alberta power trader.  since then, i have been champion internet surfer and investigating local coffee shops in an ever-widening circle.  although, things are looking up.  

eze is (i think) an earls nickname -- pronounced easy-e.  although, they may just call her easy for short.  i'm sure she loves both names very much.  

i have a very important meeting at 5 with my massage therapist and i was thinking about stopping by after that.  should i call eze's cell?  or do you have a cell #?

of course.  info here goes nowhere. we've had trouble discerning where the switching takes place because the economics get very blurry: credits, ldc costs, transport, taxes, restrictions on # hours plants can burn resis are hard to account for and are different for everybody.   also some noneconomic factors... convenience, inertia, multi-month fuel purchases, hedges, accounting procedures, resid in storage already...  It's a big blur in my mind.  I look at general levels and for anecdotal evidence.  have seen zero anecdotal evidence so far.  will also watch aga's for the indication,  but so will everybody else.

I received a phone call yesterday from  Mika Aswell (spelling?) from <NAME/> County, NM.  Her county office has received a check from Transwestern and she does not know how to apply it.  Here is what we know:

	Amount:	$7.36
	Check Date:  	December 17, 2001
	Invoice Date:	1-1-2001	#676-3004-0
	Voucher:	0100001479
	Purchase Order:	A60KD13882

Mika's phone number is (505)396-8534.

Can you please track this down and tell me or Mika how to apply this money.

Maybe the next step is to dig into the allocation methodology that <NAME/> uses to see if it assumes the correct number of people.  Then convert the monthly allocation amount to a cost per person and do the same for your other analysis so we can compare apples to apples.  When you combine origination and trading we are likely to exceed 15 people.  My guess is that we are being allocated costs based on too many people (Pre HPL Sale).

But that allows all parties to game the system rather than to bid the capacity at a value that is compatible with the individual party's economics.  Or does FERC not see that as a driver (values at which a willing buyer and a willing seller would transact).  This would always put a Seller at a disadvantage.

<NAME/>,

Managing VAR limits is essential and P&L Penalties are a great way to achieve this.  However, we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as: (1) discouraging aggressive trading; and (2) significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime.

I still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit.  The punishment does not fit the crime. What message are you trying to send?  The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times.  Also locations such as Socal, Malin and PG&E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes.  I know these are not your intended messages.  

I realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR.  We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing.   My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches (<$500,000) and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,000.  The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation.

Please consider these suggestions.  We want to play by the rules, but the rules need to be fair and known in advance.  Also, we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this morning.

The highlights I would focus on are:

1) East Power has traded over 600 million MWh's YTD 2001 (compared to 450 million MWh's for all of 2000)
2) Averaging 350 trades per day on EOL for 2001 YTD (compared to 100 in 2000).   In the last two weeks, EOL daily transactions have averaged nearly 500.
3) Significant improvement in liquidity in all markets - EPMI now trades actively through 2005 in nearly every eastern market.
4) Positive P&L in every Eastern region
5) Outstanding return on VAR.

Thanks for your note.  I've been thinking about you guys a lot, too.  I haven't been back to NYC since I left on the QE2 on 9/4.  Every time I heard about the conditions downtown I assumed you would be living in the country.  Sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel.  I know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly.  Also sorry to hear about Mrs. B.  I hope she is doing better.

It has been chaotic and very depressing here -- not that our acquisition deal went through but that we ever got in the position to need the deal to go through in the first place.  In fact, when they finally announced it, my primary feeling was one of relief.  Things had gotten very bad.  Next time we get together I can fill you in on all the details.  At least for now I am still employed and my prospects are pretty good under the circumstances.

It's nice you have Key West to get away to.  You'll have to tell me about the house that you have available but under the circumstances I doubt that I could get away often enough to justify taking on a lease.  It would be nice to get away from here now and then though.  I was supposed to go to Ft. Lauderdale (did you know <NAME/> was living there now?) a few weeks ago to visit and go to the big boat show there.  That trip had to be cancelled in all the confusion around here.  I had hoped to be in New York today for a seminar (where I was actually scheduled to speak) but cancelled that also.  With luck things will start to get back to normal here soon.  I'm really feeling the need for a break (and 4 days in Cincinnati next week don't count) so maybe I can come visit some time in the next couple of months.

Tell <NAME/> I said Hi.

Those idiots. I was in a hurry and didn't want to miss my flight, so i walked out and assumed that they would just bill the credit card.

But before I left I gave the tux to the front desk and gave them your name and room number. The guy was like, "Okay" and then walked to the back room without writting your name or anything down. So i told him again what name and room number. He said "no problem".

Oh well. Sorry about the trouble and thanks for the invite. It was a great wedding.

    I realize that times are tough, but this is really twisting the knife that is already deeply embedded in the majority of employees.  Have you ever gone down to the Body Shop in the mornings or at noon to see how many employees use the facility for health and stress relief purposes?  We've done a lot of things during the past few weeks to kill morale, but this is a new low.  Are you going to do anything about it?  I think that a lot of people would like to know.

Kyle:

Please find attached file. Transportation & Storage Revenue is right off the Earning Model Income Statement. <NAME/> data can be found in the Commercial Function detail within the "Database" worksheet of the Earning Model. The Cash Flow verbiage is very general related to the subject matter, but does provide a business reason on a Direct Cash Flow basis for an item buried within the Indirect Cash Flow format. Call me if you have any further questions and I will attempt to get you through them.    I can also get you set up to get even more detailed answers if you would like.

February/March 2001 Issue  <NAME/> Unveils Storage Trades <NAME/> Broadband has completed a series of deals in the data storage market, commoditising this fast-growing area for the first time. It acted as a market maker, purchasing storage capacity from StorageNetworks - which was then sold on to Best Buy, a retailer of electronics products. Crucially, both contracts were based on <NAME/>'s standard contract and included firm delivery with liquidated damages.  In the last few years the storage market has moved from being a self-managed and owned business to one where storage is served up from a standard metro network. <NAME/>'s involvement will be bring flexibility of contract offering and imbedded optionality, according to Ravi Thuraisingham, a senior trader at <NAME/>. "When we sell the product to the customer we remain in the market to buy the capacity back should they wish to unwind their position later. That is unprecedented," says Thuraisingham.   The storage market has historically been more flexible and more committed to firm delivery than the bandwidth market, but these trades mark a significant development. Rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to favour discounts on future purchases. "There is a premium in the price for firm delivery," says Thuraisingham.  He says that a number of other market participants are eager to commit to <NAME/> as a market maker. In addition, equipment vendors are excited by the possibilities of the market. "most storage equipment at the moment is supplied to the enterprise market. This development opens up the wholesale storage capacity market," says Thuraisingham.

3/18	On our sales to you....the MPC-EPMI Colstrip you have it priced @ $370.  This should be @ $343.85...

I need to straighten out a few personal payroll matters before I leave town on Thursday.  I was able to revise my bank deposit instructions on ERonline (my wallet was stolen over the weekend and I had to change bank accounts).  I was also able to adjust my EFCU deductions.

I am unable to complete the following changes online and I'm hoping that you can help me work these issues:
- Stop PAC contributions
- Stop Savings Bond automatic purchases
- Stop 2002 United Way deduct.  I had selected to make one time contribution in Feb (around bonus time).  My plans are to stop the automatic deduct and have the United Way bill me directly instead.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Good Morning, 

Here is the spreadsheet that you sent out with the access for the West Power Scheduling group. The users are now only me, <NAME/> Cutsforth, and <NAME/> Robinson.



 

I dont' know if you are aware, but we are having problems with accessing both PreSchedule Workspace and Path Confirmation. <NAME/> Robinson and <NAME/> Cutsforth have more details than I do, as I have been out on medical leave for a month.

<NAME/> tried to login this morning and had problems, If you are aware of this bug let me know, if you need more details, please speak to him.

His number is 503/464-3902

Thanks,

<NAME/>

When I called <NAME/>'s house today to see if she received my INS approval, one of her children answered and said that she is at <NAME/>' house -- so I guess that means <NAME/> has returned.  If your process estimates are in line, our documents would have to be translated by next week to hit a travel at the end of November date.  I am very concerned that we will slip to <NAME/>tmas time travel.

While I'm not trying to have you do my dirty work, I feel like you have a little better standing to fuss at <NAME/> or <NAME/> this week about some commitments of when paperwork will be turned in.  After all, your paperwork has been turned in for some time & you have specific health concerns for Oksana.  Since I just turned in my INS approval (even though the rest of my dossier has been in for several weeks), I feel like I don't have much standing to complain about timing.

I checked with our Travel Agency and they cannot secure cheaper tickets than what we are seeing on the internet.  It looks like $1,100 - $1,200 is about the price for the <NAME/> to Rome roundtrip.

Okay, I've already had questions about statements in this memo.  My understanding of this is as follows:  In the event of bankruptcy, employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of $4650 (If the company were to file next week, this amount should be small since payday was today).  In addition, employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at $4650.

Talked to Pescetti yesterday.  Prior to returning my call, he had received the information that Joe Kelliher had already been appointed to the open Republican spot, and therefore understands that there's no longer a Republican seat to run for.

I hear you on the liquidity <NAME/>.   With <NAME/> making those markets effective next Monday (he is on vacation), we will find out if term liquidity is possible.

Please trust me on this issue.   You will see a significant difference within weeks, not months.   At a minimum, you will at least have price discovery through 2003 on calenders (they may be $3 wide in New York, but that is better than no market).

Keep pushing on this issue.   With the volatility in the NE over the past two weeks, I'm sure you understand our reluctance on term markets in these illiquid areas.

As far as 02 or 03 quotes for E PJM and/or NY, I have heard no markets today and neither has Dana.   The pool is blowing up as we speak.

The following points refer to the methodology that we are taking to rebook the New Albany Plant.  Please send me a note immediately if you disagree.
Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and <NAME/> is the mark to market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.


*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows <NAME/> to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  <NAME/> will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  <NAME/> will also pay NewAlb $1.05/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity "NewAlb" that will return 9% assuming a book value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

*  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year for the next five.

Hey,

You sound kind of bummed out there, amiga.  Understandable though.  Tough and very weird times that's for sure.  Very sad.  The funerals must have been brutal.  I know I'm depressed by it because I get these waves of sadness that hit me out of the blue periodically.  Hopefully things will improve.

Our stock has just been munched.  It sucks because we're doing well, but the other "half" of the company appeared to be mostly smoke and mirrors.  Everyone was wondering why Skilling left; I guess we know why now.

Enough of the gloom and doom.  Sounds like you are getting opportunities--that's good.  I knew that you would.  Here's some pros/cons for your options (recalling my vast experience;))  Structuring:  Interesting but not alot of dough.  Probably the most easily replaced by those fresh MBAs.  Trading:  Like being handcuffed to a schizophrenic on speed.  Can turn you into a frothing mass of neurosis at times.  Good dough if you make it though.  Marketing:  Low immediate, constant stress, but still competitive.  You have a great deal of charm and brains, so I think you would do quite well in this area.  In addition, there are a number of firms (Calpine, AEP, Coral) who are opening up an office in Portland pretty much geared towards mid-marketing.  Might be opportunity down the road for you to move closer to home (plus you can buy me beer, which is always a plus for anyone's karma).

As far as your overall attitude towards the industry, I think I disagree.  I think it's a good industry to be in, particularly now, because no matter what, people need electricity.  And it's still changing, especially out West, so there will be challenges and opportunities.

It's great talking with you.  Cheer up.  Call your folks.  Run.  Punch a punching bag.  Do drugs (kidding).  Take care of yourself, and if you need anything, give me a buzz or drop an email.

Socal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from Socal).  Also, we need to start entering the <NAME/> basin numbers under the Questar Manual Entry pipeline, however, <NAME/> Hyde is working to set up the page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered.

Hello,

I'm back in the office today.  Well I see you have to eat crow!  I didn't get a chance to watch the game but I saw CU play Kansas St. and CU looked good. I even think CU has a good chance of beating UT in <NAME/> this weekend.  

As far as Petrogulf goes, in the mean time before the great expansion, do they have the right to go to Questar or any other interstate pipeline delivery points.  I think they can take their gas in kind at Questar/Bird Canyon, but I'm not sure.  

And finally, are you still available for dinner Wednesday night.  I just got paid so I'm looking to take you some place nice.  Yes, I am bribing you!

FYI - response after my call to <NAME/>.  Agreement refers to employees of <NAME/> Americas or its subsidiaries, and those employees involved in natural gas specifically.  <NAME/> Networks is not named, but is definitely an oversight because so much of the support for gas comes from <NAME/> Networks.  Close date on the sale was May 31, 2001 - 12 month non-solicit period starts from that point.  --<NAME/>

Hey <NAME/>,

How's it going.   Things down here are actually very slow.  They (upper Management) are still trying to figure out what to do.  In the mean time no one is trading.  I sit around most of the day and play games.  I keep waiting for some instruction about what to do next and nothing is being said.  The old hurry up and wait.   <NAME/>'s (my girlfriend) whole department got let go the other day.  She is still there until Christmas doing the clean-up but, come the new year she is going to have to try to find a new job.  Things down here could not have gone worse for her. I feel real bad, because in a way I had a part in her moving, but there is nothing I can do about it now.

Are you an unsecured <NAME/> creditor, as they agreed to pay for your school and now won't be able too?  How are thing there?  Are you liking school?

I'm heading back to Calgary on the 21st, and I'll be up there until at least the 30th (maybe longer).  I'd love to grab a beer if you have time.  You can reach me at (403) 239-0299, or I'll be stopping in at the office.

Take care and I hope to see you in cow town.

There is NO Tuesday markets available today.  We can not wire cash on Monday due to the holiday.  So, Koch will allow us to make to them an "estimate payment",,, aprox $250,000.  We will cover the postions on Monday.  The difference in actual will be netted out of Tuedays payment.

Need to think about it a bit.  Here's some of what we know based on the settlement:

Total debt = 6.35 B
After they contribute all cash on their books and agree to eat a little, the PUC is allowing them to collect somewhere between $3.0-3.3B--depends on who you talk to.
The total owed to ESPs is $243 MM.

<NAME/>:

In connection with the execution of the ISDA Master Agreement with GAF Refining LLC, Section 3 requires that they provide the following documentation:

1.	IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number)

2.	Certificate of Incumbency certifying (i) a true and correct copy of the certificate of organization or formation and operating agreement and (ii) the incumbency and specimen signature of the officer executing the ISDA on behalf of the sole member/manager of GAF Refining.

3.	Certificate of the Secretary/Assistant Secretary of GAF Refining certifying resolutions authorizing (i) the execution of the ISDA Master Agreement and (ii) the execution of energy price swap and option transactions.

I am attaching forms of the certificates listed as items 2 and 3 above.  If GAF needs the IRS W-9, they can go to their website at www.irs.gov and download a copy.

ENA will be providing a Certificate of Incumbency, certifying its articles of incorporation and bylaws and the incumbency and specimen signature of the officer executing the ISDA on behalf of ENA, together with a Certificate certifying resolutions as to its authority to enter into financial transactions and an IRS W-9.

<NAME/> & <NAME/>,
	Sorry it's taken me so long to reply.  Thank you for the darling pictures of <NAME/>.  I'm going to have to change my screensaver here at work because I still have one of the "washed in stardust" pic's and of course he's totally changed!  He's so handsome and has such a pretty complexion - and those beautiful, big, brown eyes - what a sweetheart!
	We had a great visit with "PaPaFlo"!  Dad (Cal our Dad) taught <NAME/> to jump (sort of) and now he's unable to just walk anywhere, but has to jump his way where ever he goes (thanks Dad!).  I think PaPaFlo (which now refers to your mom and Dad simultaneaously) got satisfactorily worn-out by their toddling grandson.  We went on the slide, "go to swingies", "play-da-cars", "draw-da-picture", "play-da-firetruck", "ride-da-wagon" and "read-da-book" - and I was happy to hear PaPaFlo proceeding each of those phrases rather than Mommy.  <NAME/> is busy!
	I heard <NAME/> had a cough.  I hope that clears up soon.  I also heard you were looking at a new house.  That's exciting - I'm sure you could use the room.  Good luck with that!
	<NAME/> is on the third week of his new job.  It seems to be going well.  He was bored, but now they gave him two houses in the sheetrock stage to finish.  I hope <NAME/>'s new job is good too.  <NAME/>, I heard your job was working well from a flexibility standpoint with <NAME/>.  That is really a blessing.
	I won't mention how my job is going, except I'm still here and we don't know anything you don't know.
	We were sad to hear about Mr. Sutton.
	The kids are all fine.  <NAME/> was disappointed she didn't get to see your mom and Dad while they were here.  She probably thought she might get a present =)
	I need to get out the digital camara and get some new pic's of <NAME/>.  I'll try to get those your way soon.  I'm sure Dad & Flo will have some from their visit too.

Take care!
Love,
Lindy, <NAME/>, <NAME/> & the kids

<NAME/>,  To follow up on our discussion last week, <NAME/> Compression Services Company (not a debtor, and owned 100% by ENA) is receiving physical gas under its Compression Services Agreements with Transwestern Pipeline Company.  The gas is delivered to ECS on TW's system as consideration for ECS delivery of electric compression services.  This gas was sold by ECS to ENA under a long term Master Firm, but obviously that has blown up.  TW has been desperate to get this gas off of their system since it is packing their pipeline worse every day.  We put into place a GISB with Richardson Energy Marketing, Ltd.  I made sure there was not cross affiliate netting language in the GISB.  Some of the gas was sold over the Christmas weekend (about 20,000 per day) and more is being sold this week.  We need to put into place a long term sale for the remainder of the term of the compression deals (approximately 7 years) to protect the compression services deals.  Sid may be a potential counterparty, but it may be sold to someone else.  Please provide any input you may have on how we need to structure this sale given the current situation.

<NAME/>, 

The release that <NAME/> prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that I have been paying since 4/20.  You might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000.  It might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 4/20.

Also May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes.  But I have not received payment on either.

Let's try and wrap this up this week.

Lorelie, I had sent to you last week a amending doc regarding a one month extension that the customer was looking for in order to exercise the option on some of that small volume.  They have contacted us and I beleive they will be exercising and would like to get the paperwork back in order to get this process moving. 

Can you please have document signed and returned to me soonest.

Thanks, BT

I just read an article on the Blomberg news service that says that there are now six bidders and it is expected to go on into the night.  Each bidder is in a separate conference rooms and the lawyers are going from room to room to get the latest bid and provide updates as to what the best bid amount and structure is.  Sounds wild.

Greetings:

<NAME/> everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective <NAME/> and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  The <NAME/> language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.

Best,
<NAME/>

I forwarded to you most of the ibuyit stuff still in my e-mail.  Please check all to see if they have been approved.  From this point forward, I don't want to automatically approve anything without my seeing it.  Please scan the rest of my e-mails to see if there is an ibuyit request that I failed to forward to you for you to check.  Please be sure that anything that has already been approved is deleted.  Thanks. 

Please go through my e-mails and print everything from <NAME/> Becker, put it in a folder (all should relate to follow up on the Accounting offsite in Galveston) for me.  I need to review that stuff and figure out when the next follow up meeting is going to be with either <NAME/> and/or <NAME/>.  They have asked me to chair one of the follow up issues.  Some of the e-mails from <NAME/> relate to volunteers for my team.  I think there is also one saved voice mail with a volunteer's name.  Can you create a list (with contact numbers) of all volunteers from e-mails and voice mails to date?  Thanks.  Then please delete all e-mails from <NAME/>.  

Also, please go through my e-mails and print everything that relates to Center for <NAME/>'s Future.  I need to review these.  Most is from <NAME/> Schoppe, but a few are from others, but reference CHF.  Then delete all of these e-mails.  

E-mails from <NAME/> <NAME/> regarding recruiting.  Please print all so that I can review them.  Please delete all e-mails after printing.  Thanks.  

This effort plus my clean up today should help shrink the e-mails that remain.  Thanks.  --<NAME/>

Also, though I can't make the ski trip this weekend, I definitely plan on skiing a lot this winter (maybe I'll see you at Squaw Deepikah), so let's stay in touch on the ski front.  Happy Holidays to all.

Latest information on CPUC Decision --

Commissioner Bilas filed an Alternative Draft for the CPUC that would:

*	hold DA suspension and have the CPUC conduct hearings that would work out details including impact on bonds and phasing ending of DA,
*	resolved issues related to credits and payments of Negative CTC, and
*	hold hearings dealing with bottoms-up ratemaking for DA.

This is effectively an updated version of the alternate that Bilas put out last time the CPUC considered this issue.  It is a long-shot that this alternative would be approved.  

Our current information is still that the CPUC will vote to suspend DA as of Sept 1.

<NAME/>:  I wanted to follow up on our discussion last week regarding the peaker we're helping Lodi to develop.

The project is a peaker plant inside Lodi's territory, with the power sold to DWR.
The deal is both price and time sensitive (no surprise there).  Needs to be on line Q3/Q4, 2002, at a price that's in line with price negotiated with DWR.
For the gas interconnect, your folks tell us that the project requires $8-$11 MM in system upgrades that will take 14-16 months to complete.
By contrast, the project could connect directly to Lodi's gas storage facility for about $2.6 MM and could be completed in about 4-6 months.
In short, PG&E's offers blows through both the time and price constraints; the Lodi option accommodates both very well.
We are very senstive to the tariff revenues you would forgo via a direct connect to Lodi and potential concerns regarding precedent over connecting directly to the storage facility.
Therefore, 1) we'd be willing to pay the local distribution tariff price, irrespective of being connected directly to the Lodi facility, 2) we'd be willing to switch over and connect with PG&E once the upgrades in the Lodi/Stockton area are done, and 3) we'd agree that the direct connection with Lodi should be viewed as a "special case" (and not precendent) with the goal of avoiding exacerbating California's problems with supply shortages.

Thanks for listening. Let me know what you think.

Best,
<NAME/>

Hi Sweetie,

Hopefully the visit to the Dr won't be that bad, do you want me to come hold your hand? (That would be pushing the envelope on intimacy, eh?) I saw a wrapper in the trash this morning and was sad to see it there. You need to fix that ( or those as it were). Please let me know what the dr. says.

The movie sounds good, but we will see how tired you are when you get home.  I wouldn't mind laying around like a turd this evening either. I need to vacuum but that is all.

I love you, and am so glad that I make you happy. I want us to be happy together for many years to come. I still feel like the luckiest woman in the world, to have such a caring and loving man in my life so suddenly.

See you tonight,

C

We are prepared to get with you as soon as you would like after your return from New York to review projected cost savings from ENW.  For each business unit that we support (EA, EGM, EIM, EES, EBS), we have prepared cost savings on expense and capital based on the three scenarios below.  

	Scenario 1:	<NAME/> exits the line of business, with immediate headcount reductions and cost savings quantified;
			skeleton staff remains for orderly exit of business; then final headcount reductions and cost
			savings quantified (Lights Out)

	Scenario 2:	<NAME/> retains and maintains line of business, but does not invest for growth; assumes no further systems 
			enhancements; support is scaled back from current level and is minimal (Lights On - But Dim)

	Scenario 3:	<NAME/> retains line of business and invests modestly to accommodate known market changes; service levels 
			are scaled back from current level and are a step above minimal (Lights On - Brighter) 

Cost savings in all three scenarios have been quantified at the following level of detail by commodity for EGM and EIM:

	EGM:	Freight Markets					EIM:	<NAME/> Products
		FX/IR/Equity						Steel
		Domestic Crude & Products
		International Crude & Products

<NAME/>,

I plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format.  The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000.  But there is not a professional management company.  Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000.  However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit.  This would yield an NOI of $240,000.  Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside.  

The asking price is $2,700,000.  Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap.  Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap.  The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project.  The cost per square foot is 36.58.  

The numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million.  <NAME/> Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go.  This property has not been on the market.  So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it.  If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million.  It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants.  Plus the location is by far the most convenient.

Financing is the other consideration.  I am assuming 25 year, 7%,  and 25% down.  What do you think could actually be achieved?  Can you put me in contact with a lender?

I will follow up with a phone call.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

jacques,

I have attached a summary of the utilities I paid since the 4/20 closing.  The total is $7,328.87.  Do you need to incorporate this number is the release  or can I just net this amount against the $11,000 and pay them the difference.  Do they have an executable copy of the release?  I would like to settle up on the repairs, utilities, and the release now.  I don't want these issues to get bogged down with the 1st lienholders approval of any assignments.

As things change, so do call schedules.  We conferred and have recommend that:

There will not be a call this week.
Beginning next week, the call will take place once per week, on Wednesdays, at the same time (11:30 AM PDT), same call-in number (we hope).
Until the next legislative session starts up, the call will be optional for the gang in Sacramento.

If you have any alternative suggestions, questions, and/or comments, please let me know. And please forward to others who need/would like to know.

Couple of additional pieces of information:

In conjunction with the issue paying ESPs past due PX amounts, <NAME/> has affirmed that it will be making a proposal regarding how it wants to calculate the PX credit going forward.
It remains unclear whether <NAME/> will try to fold controversial issues into negotiations on getting paid past due PX credit amounts(e.g., PX credit contributed to undercollection and therefore DA customers should help pay down the undercollection; DA customers must pay for stranded DWR contracts, etc.).  
So while <NAME/> is making good noises about wanting to settle (which is a certainly a step in the right direction), it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter.
Got a call into <NAME/> Fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions.
<NAME/> report back when (and if) we get some answers.

Best,

USA: Customer choice can boost 'green power' use-study.
NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Giving consumers more energy supply choices could boost use of cleaner electricity sources by 40 percent by the end of the decade, regardless of whether the market is deregulated, a federal study said. 
But there's a catch. While 10 percent of U.S. electricity already comes from hydro and another 2 percent comes from wind, solar and geothermal sources, stimulating alternative energy demand to meet the 40-percent goal will require more so-called green pricing programs, which are often more expensive to the consumer. 
According to the study, pushing consumers to adopt electricity alternatives besides coal, oil, gas or nuclear will require utilities to offer green power choices. Indeed, the study showed some customers will 'go green' even if the price is higher than conventional sources. 
"Market research consistently shows that consumers prefer to receive their power from clean energy sources ... giving consumers energy supply choices can be a powerful mechanism for moving renewable energy into the marketplace," said Blair Swezey, co-author of the study. 
Swezey works at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which conducted the study along with the <NAME/> Berkeley National Laboratory. Both organizations are U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories. 
The study does not advocate competitive markets over regulated markets, but suggests utilities in states without competition should offer their customers green products. 
"If competitive retail markets fail to materialize, utility programs must pick up the slack," said Ryan Wiser of <NAME/> Berkeley National Laboratory, another co-author of the study. 
CALIFORNIA CAVEAT 
Green power marketing had seen success in states with retail market competition, such as in California . 
But in the wake of California 's heavily publicized deregulation crisis, the state seems to have backed away from deregulation, and green power has been one of the victims. 
"The California experience shows that the transition to competitive retail power markets will not be smooth," Wiser added, noting that at least until California makes up its mind regarding the fate of deregulation, green power programs will remain on the back-burner. 
More than 85 utilities in 29 states out of more than 500 utilities nationwide give consumers the option to choose to buy power from renewable sources, meaning much of the potential growth for green power use has not yet materialized. 
Non-hydro renewables provide about 2 percent, or 16,500 megawatts (MW), of all the electricity used in the United States. Hydropower provides about 10 percent. 
With the expansion of customer choice, the study found the market could support about 6,000 MW of additional non-hydro renewables over the next decade. 
National Renewable Energy Laboratory, based in Golden, Colorado, is a research center for alternative fuels managed by Midwest Research Institute, technology developer Battelle and global engineering firm Bechtel. 
<NAME/> Berkeley National Laboratory, of Berkeley, California , is a scientific research center managed by the University of California .

<NAME/> --

<NAME/> Cantrell had entered <NAME/> into a number of dockets before FERC related to pipeline rate and other matters (not sure if there were protests).  I would greatly appreciate you coming over to 47 and going through a number of filings so we can either (a) stay in the case or (b) remove our name as an active party.  <NAME/> Linnell has the papers on 47.

My initial thought is that <NAME/> does not need to continue in these cases, but the NewCo will want to understand what to join after formation.  We may want to talk with commercial types to gauge their thoughts.

Please let me know if you can take care of this.

Thanks,

As of right now this is the plan for the killed transactions:
  Please use the attached spreadsheet that indicates the prior day changes in your rolls.  Then compare these actual changes to the projected changes in the spreadsheet below.  As of tonight, please top-level all prior day changes and we will tackle tomorrow.  Also, remember that traditionally you would have no financial prior days on the first business day, so the financial prior days showing up in your rolls are due to killed financial transactions.  These amounts should also be top-leveled.

Randy, I tried to send you a note about a week ago about my elk hunt but it came back undelivered.  I thought you might have changed your address.  Guess I typed it in by mistake. (age does that to you sometimes).  Yes, things are stressful, but as you eluded to God doesnt give His kids a spirit of fear, but confidence that He is in control.  I never thought I d see the <NAME/> empire tumble, but when you torture and strangle a corporation hard enough and long enough, eventually it gives up and surrenders.  There is a push underway to isolate the pipelines from the <NAME/> umbrella and make all business units with money making assets separate from the rest of <NAME/>.  Transwestern is definately a money making asset, and that is what may keep me afloat.  Well see.  Anyway, as long as I keep my focus on <NAME/> and keep reminding myself of that which is important (family and health) I know Ill come through all of this.

Sorry to hear that there is the word "reorganization"  in Hess.  this kind of stuff generally never does anything but upset employees and create a period of time when nobody is productive.  I hate this kind of stuff. I know that change is inevitable, but so disruptive.  Ill keep you in prayer. Isnt it great to have the confidence and assurance that we serve a big enough God, that He can handle all our problems?  Keep the faith......my friend and focus on the eternal.  Just like <NAME/> wrote, were just pilgrims in a foregin land, waiting for the trip home and promise of <NAME/>'s return.

Jerry,

I had a couple of questions about the exchange.

1.	Can I place the replacement property into a limited partnership?
2.	The cash to be escrowed is approx. $650K.  At money market rates of 3.5% the interest in six months would be over $10K.  <NAME/> the funds be held in an interest bearing account and will I receive the interest?
3.	Should I fed ex all these documents to the title company?

Thank you,

Another interesting problem that may lead to a trip to an exotic place.

As you know, Brazil is in the midst of a very severe power shortage. About
95% of installed capacity in Brazil is hydro (out of about 65 GW) and the level of
water in the reservoirs  is about 20% of the normal. We have a huge
exposure in Brazil given our LDC investments and merchant power plants.

Measuring water level in the reservoirs is a critical project and boys from Brazil 
are asking for help. We have looked into a similar problem in Norway and came up with interesting
technical solutions but had to drop it because of lawyers' objections. These
objections may not apply to Brazil.

Can we arrange for a conference call between you and me and Remy Collonge from
Sao Paulo to discuss the problem? He will be  back in his office on Tuesday .

I shall call you tomorrow about it. What is your phone number?

<NAME/>,

This e-mail is attempting to answer the request made by you and <NAME/> a few weeks ago. 

Attached are my projected balance for 2004 NOx SIP CALL.  It is based on numbers from EEA (environment consultants), EPA website, NOx SIP Call model, and new generation database.  The confidence level for overall balance is not that high.  The OTR states only need to reduce 15% from 2001 to 2003 to be in compliance.  They have some SCRs already built and the plans for the other SCRs needed.  The non-OTR states are far more dirty than the OTR states.  The big question mark is the cost of technology that will be available for the 2004 states.  I believe that there will be a demand for allowances.  I believe the NOx SIP Call market to be a short at this point.  People think it is worse than it really is.

Also, I can make a price forecast.  The confidence level would be low on the price forecast.  What else do you want here?

Hello,

I was just dropping this note to see if anyone was interested in getting together for the Rice Owls homecoming game against Tulsa this weekend.  Game time is 2 pm and I thought we would get walk-up tickets (eveyman for himself).  If people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to kick-off and watch the 6-3 Owls (undefeated at home)  kill the Tulsa Hurricanes.  Drop me a line if you have interest as I am trying to get critical mass. 

<NAME/>

PS. Please invite anyone that has interest in coming along and bring your kids if you have them.

<NAME/>,
      I've not kept up with <NAME/> for the past several years.  I can say, that during the four years that <NAME/> worked for me, he created value every year without having tasks and opportunities handed to him.  In fact, even in his worst year, he created $6.5m.  <NAME/> really  started our currency arb's (US/Canadian) in 1992 when we worked on Sithe.  The concept of a "virtual power station" was co-created by <NAME/> and Joe Gold (his associate) when they sold a virtual pump storage to National Power Ltd. after their failed attempt purchase an actual pump storage in the UK (trading peak against off-peak spreads seems to be no great feat today, but no one had ever done one in 1996).  A lot of what we've done the past few years stems back to many of the ground breaking things that <NAME/> and Joe started ( including the way that we structured the tolling agreements surrounding our Sutton Bridge Plant in the UK). 
      As for enemies at <NAME/>---I think that they are all gone (<NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/> Stokes and crew).  I think that <NAME/> Frevert still thinks highly of <NAME/> and understands that <NAME/> was put in a bad situation (being put in the middle of the <NAME/> and <NAME/> thing).
      I do know that <NAME/> has turned around his life quite significantly--he's very <NAME/> and has a lot less ego than he once had.  If I could hire him back, I would.  I'd just cut him loose, ask him to make me $6.0m/yr., and he'd deliver me $10.0m/yr.  I'd take as many of those kind of people that you could find for me.
      Let me know if I can help further.

FYI :
When entering deals with Canada, please remember to have the counter parties in a financial deal to be ECC and Riskmantra and a physical deal it will be ENA to ECC.
Also remember on gas daily out months(2 legs) that the book on the gas daily swap leg needs to be INTRA-CND-WE-GD not INTRA-CAND-WEST(this book is for basis piece).

ALSO:
Please remember to check your new deals completely every day, this will help eliminate future OA variances.  Do not rely on your trader to catch mistakes.

Thanks.

Thanks for owning the question and sending me your ideas.  I agree that some sort of planned rotation for experienced hires could be beneficial to the company and to the employees.

There is a very good website for getting information regarding current events - www.drudgereport.com  I highly recommend you read it if you want to get the "real scoop" about what is going on in the World Trade Center bombings.  As to who is responsible there is almost overwhelming evidence that Osama Bin Laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind and/or financier.  If you are interested -  read the article below that gives a breakdown on who is believed to be responsible.
Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist that has targeted American people before (embassy bombings in 1998 and attack on USS <NAME/> in Yemen earlier this year) and it would be in America's best interest to end his reign of terror by ending his life!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. focuses on Bin Laden links with Hizbullah, Arafat's Fatah 
 
SPECIAL TO WORLD TRIBUNE.COM
Friday, September 14, 2001
WASHINGTON - The United States is investigating whether a coalition of Palestinian, Iranian and Lebanese groups joined to help launch the suicide attacks in New York and Washington.

U.S. defense sources said the Pentagon and CIA are quickly coming to the conclusion that Saudi billionaire fugitive Osama Bin Laden was the sponsor of the attack. But they said Bin Laden is believed to have used a range of Islamic groups for logistics and support.

The groups being investigated include the Fatah movement headed by Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, the sources said. Another group being examined for a link to the U.S. attacks is the Iranian-backed Hizbullah, Middle East Newsline reports.

"Most of it today points to Osama Bin Laden," Sen. <NAME/> Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said. "But the speculation at the end of the road is that he and his network were very much involved with Hizbullah, Fatah and other."

Grassley was one of at least two dozen House and Senate members who were briefed by U.S. intelligence agencies since the bombing.

A U.S. official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that Bin Laden was provided aid by a range of Arab and Islamic groups. But the official said no determination has been made.

"We want to be sure we understand all the connections, not just one connection," the official said. "As we find out who actually perpetrated the crime, as we find out who they're connected with, as we find out who could be considered harboring them, I think it'll come clear."

Analysts and some congressional sources said the Bush administration appears unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of Iraq in the U.S. attacks. They said that the administration fears that targeting Iraq would dash hopes for an Arab coalition against terrorism in the Middle East.

Defense Secretary <NAME/> Rumsfeld said the United States has not yet determined who was behind the bombing. Rumsfeld said a determination would have to be made soon.

The administration has requested $20 billion for a counterterrorism campaign. Defense Secretary <NAME/> Wolfowitz said much of the requested allocation would prepare the military for an expected counterattack.

"I don't think we know the breakdown yet, partly because the needs are so enormous," Wolfowitz said. "A significant piece of this is going to be to bring our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness."

Please complete Hayden's form for your respective regions.  

Keep in mind that this could act as potential position limit set forth by UBS so be careful in completing this form.   In addition, UBS has a liquidity reserve used to adjust curves when marking P&L.    The "liquidity reserve" accounts for the fact you can't liquidate at the mid and with big positions you probably can't even liquidate at the bid (offer).

Thanks.

Communication Skills    	         1	Very strong and effective communicator.	
Poise / Confidence    	         1	No problem here.  <NAME/> is quite confident without being cocky.	
Leadership Potential   	         1	 It is very easy to imagine <NAME/> in a leadership role.	
Personality / Enthusiasm    	         1	Very energetic and ascited about the possibility of being   a Texas MBA student.	
Maturity    	         2	She should not have any problem mixing with older, more-experienced students.	
Clarity of Professional Focus    	         2	Seems very focused on the potential opportunities following receiving an MBA degree, but is still open-minded. 	


Please provide the Admission Committee with a brief narrative overview of your AdmissionVisit dialogue. You may use this opportunity to elaborate further on the above rankings. 

We had a very comfortable and open exchange of information regarding her work experience and views on current business topics.  She is well-seasoned in dealing with complex business issues and would very likely be ahead of many of her fellow students.  She exudes confidence yet remains open to new ideas and ways of thinking.  I have no reservation in saying that <NAME/> would flourish at UT and contribute significantly to the overall quality of the class.


Do you believe this candidate is a good match for the culture and strengths of the TEXASMBA program? Please elaborate on any reservations you may have. 

<NAME/> is definitely a good match for the Texas MBA program.  She is a high energy, very results-oriented individual with a tremendous track record of successful accomplishments.  Her personality is very conducive to working in a diverse team environment and I see no issue that would prevent her from being a top-notch MBA student at UT.

There are 3 excellent players whom I would draft onto any team that have not been picked up on the Netco list.  

Two of the three are <NAME/> Hall and <NAME/> Sweeney - details below in my e-mail to <NAME/>.  

Another excellent player is Shona <NAME/>.  She currently leads the group that produces the DPR and the MPR.  She had excellent experience with PWC before joining <NAME/>, auditing trading companies in Europe.  I have some thoughts on the value that she could bring in working with a new owner of the business.  She could be instrumental in blending our risk reporting process with another entity.  

I am not sure about the extent of your involvement with the creation of Netco.  If you do anticipate being involved, I would like to talk with you about these individuals and the roles that they could play in creating the best team for Netco.  --<NAME/>

Hello <NAME/>,

Thanks for your message.  The first two pages look like an good opening to an article on
a spark spread option.

A few comments.

1. A spark spread model has two primary uses. It can be used for pricing stand alone options
traded in the OTC markets and also can be used as foundation stone for a real options valuation
model of a generation plant.

<NAME/> --

To let you know where we stand on the CPUC's Investigation on DA Suspension.  

1.	<NAME/> <NAME/> is leading the effort to respond to the CPUC for <NAME/>.

2.	We knew that the CPUC was at a minimum going to investigate how and/or whether to allow extensions of contracts and the application of other surcharge $$ to DA load given their earlier statements.  The issue on retroactivity is open primarily because they can ask these questions and (I believe) as leverage for other issues.

3.	We are coordinating with the big customers who recently left.  They are marshalling forces to oppose any retroactivity.  This is as much their fight as it is ours.

4.	At this time, <NAME/> will file as a member of AReM.  We intend to oppose the CPUC's request for our contracts and transaction information.

If you want any other info or want to discuss further, let me know.

I met with <NAME/> Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on where they are heading.

1). We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test environment. They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect it to their production site. He assured me it will be the same contract that all the founders have to sign to get access to it. Esentially, if we trade or provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to pay for it.

2). He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model. They will try to make their money through mid and back office services.

3). Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2). his vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks. In a nutshell he beleives the FCM's are all interconnected and used to moving money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse, so why not expand their role.

4). When I expressed some skepticism about 3). he asked if we would like to participate in a forum with other ICE members to discuss shared mid and back ofice services. I told him we would.

If anyone has any questions about this let me know.

<NAME/>,

I sent a copy of an article discussing oil and gas stocks.  The main idea was that everyone is selling so it is probably a good time to be buying.  I had lost your email so I sent it to <NAME/> and asked him to forward it to you.  I guess he is technology challenged.  The article was just one analyst's opinion.  He can find dozens of articles just like it online.  It was not important.

On a different note, <NAME/> is at T Bar M camp this week.  <NAME/> is very anxious about this.  The only info we get is through the camp's website.  Each day they post candid pictures from the prior day.  We scan through to try and spot <NAME/>.  So far we have found her in one picture each day.  It is kind of fun trying to find her.  If you want to give it a try, go to their website at  www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml <http://www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml> .  Click on sports camp parent connection.  There are a few paragraphs about each day and a spot to click for the pictures from that day.  See if you can find her.

<NAME/> and <NAME/>'s house looks like it is taking shape fast.  The Meckels seem to do good work.  I might have to reconsider using them for our house.
We should be in town Friday.  We have to be at the camp at 8:30 on Saturday.  See you soon.

<NAME/>,
	I'm trying to rebuild my PC at home.  The hard drive cratered on me.  I've installed a new one, but the only windows operating system I have is on a restore disk from Compaq (win95) and for some reason, it's giving me an "image builder" error when I try the restore.  This may be due to the fact that I trying to restore on a bigger hard drive than the original.

Anyway, I also have win98 upgrade 2nd edition.  When I try to load this, is looks for verification of ownership of a previous win system (which I don't have except on the restore disk which won't work).

So my question is this, do we have an old Win98 operating system lying around I can borrow so I can load my win98 upgrade?

thanks,

Well, it was too brief, and I didn't get to work with you nearly as much as I'd hoped. But when I did, it was very enjoyable.  All the best.  These are strange and unsettling days, but it seems that the best among us always land on their feet, so I'm sure that's where you'll end up.  Take care and hope to cross paths again soon.

I have been friends with <NAME/> Corman since 1985.  We have worked together and maintained a personal friendship through the year.  <NAME/> is a kind and loving person.  She is active in her church and in charitable activities.  I met her husband, <NAME/> Erb, in 1997 and have been friends with <NAME/> and <NAME/> as a couple since that time.  Both <NAME/> and <NAME/> are loving parents to their six-year old son <NAME/>.  It has been a delight to watch them raise <NAME/> to be such a fine young man.

Hi Dear Man,

I feel the same way that you do, I feel like you are a gift that the universe has given to me. You are such a rare and special man. I love being with you and having fun with you, I love your tenderness and your competitiveness and your sense of humor.  What did I ever do to deserve you!

If we aren't too tired tonight, let's go poke around a store or something. Maybe linens and things to look for kitchen stuff??  We are going to have such fun together.

I love you,

I'm sure you know by know, but <NAME/> got it pretty bad over the weekend.  We were OK, but the flooding was unbelievable.  We were at Lake Conroe (K's parents live on the lake) on Friday night.  It rose at least 3 feet (and it's a big lake!) in a matter of 5 hours.  My boat is on a lift out of the water.  In the morning it was floating.  Their dock is underwater.  I've never seen anything like it.  I hope everyone over there is alright.  Have you seen the newest edition?  We hope to get down your way sometime this summer.  Until then stay dry and take care.

I am going to miss the meeting with Vladi about Z6 and weather hedges.  I have been planning to be on vacation on August 1st -August 3rd and we are driving this afternoon before the kids get too cranky.

I went over the analysis with Vladi.  It still seems that the bias of the weather products towards an above normal winter and the averaging vs event nature of the weather options keep them from being an effective hedge for Z6.

See you on Monday.

?	We met with <NAME/> yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
?	<NAME/> continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--"contributed to <NAME/>'s undercollection" and all customers must pay it down; 
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	<NAME/> says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 
4.	<NAME/> intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  <NAME/> estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under <NAME/>'s plan, <NAME/> would likely end up paying <NAME/>, i.e., the present value of the "undercollection" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with <NAME/>, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and <NAME/> 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose <NAME/>'s proposal at the PUC.
?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.
?	We are scheduled to meet with <NAME/> again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
<NAME/>

On slide # 17, as we discussed yesterday, I think we'll have to do without the 2001 throughput numbers because the FERC Form 2's aren't published yet for 2001.  We could update the presentation when the numbers are published.

On slide # 28, there's a note at the bottom "% of Revenue".  What do we need here?  Do I need to get you a number(s)?

I will need 1 senior analyst and possibly could fill some of my cash trading needs with an additional associate.  I have talked to <NAME/> Hull (third year analyst) about a one year rotation at our desk.  He spent his first rotation in the Texas Risk Group and did a great job.  His second rotation has been in the EOL Marketing Group.  He is interested in trading and is a sharp guy.  I would like to see some of the other folks coming in just to compare against him and to see if using an associate is a viable option for my cash trading needs.

My flight doesn't get in until 10:30 or so on Friday night.  Not sure what we can still do for food at that hour.  Do people eat late in Ft. Lauderdale?  In case you're still looking for food ideas, I found these that looked interesting:


Bistro Mezzaluna
Armadillo Cafe (Davie)
Left Bank
Hobo's Fish Joint (Coral Springs)
<NAME/> & Olivers Cafe Maxx (Pompano Beach)

Not sure but I think the first two may be reasonably close to the airport, the next one in Fort Lauderdale but have no idea where the last two are.  All get good marks in Zagats.  Look them up at zagats.com and see what you think.

I still think that <NAME/> should be advocating some form of Negawatt program for non-retail access states.  Using an RTP tariff that more closely tracks the wholesale prices from an RTO balancing energy market with locational signals can be used without any retail access and can have the load response needed to keep prices from skyrocketing - of course this would require a DA market because the signals need to come in ahead of the usage.

By the way, I disagree that we need a wholesale rate for capacity.  We should make sure that we put this in our comments on RTO Week.

I have received an urgent data request from the counterparty for Netco.

They want the following asap:

Signed copies of contracts for <NAME/> Whalley and <NAME/> Kaminsky (who may not have a contract)
Sample signed agreement for a regular trader (presumably give one at vp and above and one below vp) -- I can get this from my files easily
Signed sample agreement for an IT person, such as <NAME/> Webb (I think I can get this one as well).

They also want the following data for the 838:

	<NAME/>
	Position/title
	2000 total compensation (broken down by base, bonus, etc)
	Comp for 2001, broken down by base, bonus, etc.  (I'd exclude stay bonus in this number)
	If the person has a contract, what is the future value of the contract
	Did the person get a stay bonus last week?  If so, amount.
	Date of hire
	If under contract, beginning and end date of the term of that agreement.

They are in a rush for this data, so give me a call and let me know how quickly we can assemble it.

Thanks a lot!

You've got that right.   I'm am short all of the power and am getting frustrated.   I am breaking all of the trading rules by ignoring the price action which continues to be somewhat bullish in power.   There seems to be very solid fixed price support at these lower levels.

In particular, the NE markets refuse to go down despite the fact that Benson has been a fairly aggessive seller the past two days in the 02 and 03 period.   For the 1st time in a couple of weeks, however, the cash market is showing signs of weakness.

Overall, I am very bearish and my position reflects that.   Like you, I have worn some curveshift the past month.

3.  Vacation and work hours - Discuss vacation schedules for the rest of the year.  We need to do a good job of coordinating when we are out.

We have actually been able to find that bread here at <NAME/>'s, so we are absolutely set man.  If they stop selling it, we can get it over the internet, it is just a little pricier.  You need to get us to start buying it here and shipping to you man - <NAME/>'s has it for less than $4 a loaf.  I think Ashley said it is close to $6 in San <NAME/>.  We still need to get you some soup don't we?

<NAME/> and <NAME/>--
	Following up on our meeting today, I need to know what my negotiation parameters are regarding the fuel charge for our Sun Devil Project.  How much (if any) can I discount the fuel charges for Sun Devil shippers, based on the following assumptions, 

Project cost $911mm
Include all compression adds/mods from <NAME/> Cebryk engineering scope dated 9/28/01
Incremental Volume MMBtu/d: 780,000 San <NAME/>, 810,000 Mainline, 500,000 to Phoenix, 310,000 to Cal Border
Of 1,520,000 total capacity to Cal Border and 500,000 to Phoenix, assume 390,000 has to come from East of Thoreau
Assume load factors in 10% increments from 50% west flow up to 100%.
Assume fuel collection of 5% from shippers

In theory, we all agreed in the meeting that with the additional loop line installed for Sun Devil, and the new compressors at stations 1-4 are more efficient, then the actual fuel use should be less.  Please verify this for the load factors above.  If we can keep the same net fuel retainage, but collect less because our actual fuel use is less, then this is a win-win for both TW and the Sun Devil shippers.

Is an answer possible by Tuesday 11/12?

thanks

Kelly:

Thanks for getting back to me with your analysis.  Here's what I've done:

Not sure what the situation is with the Lead Expediter (95%) position -- the phone line of the manager for that one doesn't seem to be working and an e-mail to him was returned as undeliverable -- even though his name was in the company e-mail address book.  But he's in the same department as one of the jobs below (Sr. Purchasing Agent I think), and this position is a more junior slot, so you probably want to be considered for the more senior position first anyway.

The Senior Project Manager (80-90%) and Senior Purchasing Agent (80%) slots are still open.  I talked briefly to the managers listed on the postings and have forwarded your resume to them for consideration.  I have no feel for the timing on the Proj. Mgr. position and in fact the manager was a bit brusque, but the guy on the Purch. Agent job said the timing was great since he's taking a stack of resumes home with him this weekend to review.

I've left voice-mail messages concerning the Construction Engineer (90%) and Process/Mechanical Engineer II (80%) positions and will forward your resume if they are still looking.

 On the others, it might make sense to go ahead and go through the application process on the website.  Particularly for the one that says not to contact them directly -- there's no pointing in making them mad before they even see your resume!

I'll keep you posted on the others.  If there are no answers to my voicemails by the middle to end of next week, you might want to submit for those on the website, too.  At least then you know your resume is in the hopper.

Hi,

I'm responding to an email sent by <NAME/> Callahan on Nov 30 regarding questions on tax equalization.  I also left a voice-message for you.  

I'm in the Calgary office and paid out of the U.S.  I've been operating under the assumption that i 
wouldn't get hit twice on income taxes as there is a "credit" between Canada and the U.S.  However, after doing some reasearch on the IRS website, it seems there may be a cap to the "credit" that is allowable.  Do you know anything about this? or can you point me to someone who might be knowledgeable in such matters?  

thanks,

I've asked <NAME/> <NAME/> to try and develop through AReM some form of legal action that the industry could file if the CPUC goes through with its current plans to retroactively suspend DA as of July 1.

Our goal should be to file tomorrow evening (assuming CPUC action).  To make sure that we are on board, it probably makes sense to have a phone call to discuss the draft sometime tomorrow early afternoon (1pm PST?).  I will leave it to <NAME/> <NAME/> to arrange with the people on this e-mail a conference call to discuss the draft.

My choice would be to not have <NAME/> file the paper, but rather work through AReM.

Current position:

We have paid them all of the margin  they have contractual rights for - $33.5mm gone out today which is margin under our financial gas contract.
However, they want full collateral on all of their power position (this is being driven by <NAME/> <NAME/> on their power floor -ex <NAME/> employee), the amount is another $220mm (they have no collateral rights to this). 

Essentially, the credit guy (<NAME/> <NAME/>) is hurting us in the market and anything you can do to help is appreciated.  I believe some of this is vindictive behaviour from an ex-employee and senior management may not know what he is up to.

Hi <NAME/> & <NAME/>,

<NAME/> you are doing well.  Just wanted to check in and make sure that you received the notarized copies of my INS approval.

When I spoke with <NAME/> a few days ago, she said that she thought we would travel 10 days or so after the Almaty group, probably in late November.  

After I get off the phone I always think of  questions I should have asked.  Since my questions are not critical, but process in nature, I thought I'd drop an email.  
I am unclear about the steps that need to happen between now and travel.  How long does translation take?  What happens after that?  When is the dossier sent to Kazakstan?  Typically, how much notice are people given of their Kazak court date?

I would also like to get your views on the likelihood of the process slipping such that our travel would fall over the Christmas holiday -- as that would present some childcare concerns for me back in <NAME/>. 

Sorry for so many questions.  I know that you are both very busy and I know that patience is definitely in order with this process.  I am just so very new to this international adoption process and want to make certain that I am realistic about the steps involved.

In their response they indicated that they will only provide flows for the one or two locations for which <NAME/> has capacity allocations.  <NAME/> Gaskill indicated that you would be able to comment on whether this is consistent with the FERC 637 reporting requirements.  We wish to aquire historical flows for all metered points currently reported daily on Questars website (only 30 days history is available on their system) from June 1, 2000 to March 1, 2001.  I have attached my original request and Questar's response.  Feel free to call with questions (3-0472).  Thank you in advance.

Gerry,

Per our conversation, I am requesting historical scheduled (final cycle) quantities for Questar Pipeline meter points.  Questar previously provided flows up to June of 2000.  We are now requesting from June 1, 2000 to March 1, 2001.  I would prefer the information be emailed to me.  Otherwise the postal address is:  Rm#3299E, 1400 Smith St., <NAME/>, TX 77002.

****************************************************
PUC Chief's Iron Resolve Evident in <NAME/> Deal
Politics: Insisting on her agency's independence, <NAME/> Lynch repeatedly stood up to the governor who appointed her.
SACRAMENTO -- Once again last week, California Public Utilities Commission President <NAME/> Lynch gave Gov. Gray <NAME/> help that he badly needed--but left him upstaged.

With the governor unable to broker a deal to save Southern California <NAME/> from bankruptcy, Lynch and commission lawyers secretly negotiated a $3.3-billion settlement that was ratified by a federal judge in Los Angeles on Friday.

Although <NAME/> appointed Lynch as PUC president, she and administration officials say she informed the administration of the talks only after they were well underway. "I will take responsibility," Lynch said.

Even as she took the lead in forging an <NAME/> deal, Lynch defied the governor Tuesday. She led the PUC in rejecting a measure that <NAME/> and Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides deem necessary for repaying the state for billions of dollars in power purchases this year. <NAME/> condemned the vote as "an irresponsible act."

<NAME/> repeatedly has said he wants people he appoints to think and act as he would act. Lynch, however, is not easily controlled. She has moved ahead without the governor's approval several times. Most notably, last spring, she pushed the largest electricity rate increase in state history through the PUC while <NAME/> was publicly opposed to a rate hike.

Such actions have made her perhaps <NAME/>' least favorite appointee.

And yet, Lynch holds the key to resolving what now is <NAME/>' single most pressing issue: how to reimburse the state for the billions spent on electricity since January.

For months, those power purchases have been eating a huge hole in the state treasury. Unless a way is found to close it, <NAME/> may have to make deep cuts in public services next year just as he prepares to run for reelection. He has proposed reimbursing the treasury with a $12.5-billion bond issue that would be paid off by electricity consumers.

<NAME/> would not discuss Lynch for this article. But his aides say there is so much tension between the two that the governor and Lynch talk only through intermediaries. A top aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described the governor's relationship with Lynch, who once served on <NAME/>' staff, as "nonexistent."

But floating the bond deal requires action by the PUC, and <NAME/> aides admit that figuring out a way to do that means dealing with Lynch, whose term does not expire until 2005 and whose influence is now stronger than ever, according to fellow commissioners and others familiar with the agency.

<NAME/> could demote Lynch from PUC president to just commissioner, but "he can't remove commissioners," said the <NAME/> aide who described the tension between the two. "We are in a position where we're going to have to negotiate."

A Yale-educated attorney who practiced in San <NAME/> before joining the administration, Lynch worked on <NAME/>' 1998 campaign, helping him raise money. He rewarded her loyalty by making her head of the Office of Research and Planning, then placing her on the PUC in late 1999.

Lynch has taken seriously the idea, enshrined in the early 20th century laws that created the PUC, that the commission is supposed to be independent.

She recalls spending Christmas 1999 reading the Public Utilities Code, written 90 years ago, and concluding that Progressive Gov. <NAME/> Johnson envisioned "an independent agency, independent from the Legislature as well as from the governor, [that] would allow regulators in a highly technical field to do essentially the right thing."

"Before, I was on [<NAME/>'] staff, and as staff, you are supposed to follow the lead absolutely of your boss," Lynch said. "Now, I was appointed to an independent constitutional body. While I feel I've built bridges to the governor and the Legislature, I take very seriously the PUC's constitutional independence."

Critics, including many in the <NAME/> administration and some in the Legislature, call Lynch unbending. She is particularly adamant on the commission's independence.

Insisting on Independence

Accounts of how the <NAME/> deal was reached underline Lynch's insistence on preserving the PUC's independent authority. The events also show how strong a position she holds as the PUC and the administration negotiate over the bond deal.

Starting in April, when he unveiled his proposed rescue of <NAME/>, <NAME/> and his aides lobbied hard to win support in the Legislature. <NAME/> had no Republican support, and faced skepticism from fellow Democrats.

Lynch was another skeptic; <NAME/>' proposal would have weakened the PUC's authority to regulate <NAME/>. Her criticism of the proposal strengthened the hand of Senate Leader <NAME/> <NAME/> (D-San <NAME/>), an ally of Lynch's and the most influential critic of the governor's proposal.

<NAME/> did win approval of a modified version of his plan in the Assembly. But late on Sept. 14, the Senate adjourned for the year without agreeing to any <NAME/> bill.

The governor said he would order lawmakers to return to Sacramento in early October for a special session to consider it again.

Lynch seized an opportunity. She wanted to escape a $5.5-billion federal lawsuit that <NAME/> had filed against the PUC. She also figured there might be a way to restructure <NAME/>'s debt without the bells and whistles proposed by <NAME/> and other lawmakers.

It was a good time to talk. Wholesale electricity prices were down significantly, interest rates were falling, and the rate increase she had pushed through earlier in the year had made more money available to the utility.

"When we looked at the numbers fresh, we realized that the numbers had changed," enough that <NAME/> might avoid bankruptcy without a complex legislative bailout, Lynch said.

At her direction, PUC General Counsel <NAME/> Cohen made the initial call to <NAME/>.

<NAME/>, PUC Started Secret Talks

<NAME/> executives had their doubts that the PUC could resolve the utility's problems. In their view, past inaction by the commission had helped bring the firm to the brink of bankruptcy.

But with prospects uncertain in the Legislature, both sides met Sept. 19 in the San <NAME/> offices of the utility's private counsel, Munger, Tolles & Olson. Talks went on for 12 days.

The PUC had three conditions. "One, we would try to see if we could assure them enough in rates to pay back down their debt over a certain period," Cohen said. "Second, there would have to be a sharing of pain by shareholders. And third, there could be no terms that would limit or restrict the commission's regulatory authority."

Lynch and the PUC staff kept negotiations secret. Word of the talks could stampede creditors into forcing the utility into bankruptcy, they feared. Another concern was that the talks could jeopardize a legislative solution to <NAME/>'s problem.

Lynch did notify her fellow commissioners, whose support she would need to pull off a settlement. PUC Commissioner <NAME/> Brown, one of three <NAME/> appointees on the five-member board, said Lynch told him Sept. 21 "in the strictest confidence" about the negotiations with <NAME/>.

"If it became public, it could blow up," Brown said. "There would be too much hullabaloo."

For several days, however, Lynch did not inform <NAME/>. Meanwhile, the governor's aides continued to hold talks in hopes of putting together a legislative compromise.

On Sept. 25, some of <NAME/>' top aides met with key legislative staffers in a daylong session. By the end of the meeting, both sides realized a major gulf remained.

That same day, Lynch called Sacramento to pass word to <NAME/> that the talks were underway. A few lawmakers also were told. Two days later, the governor announced that he was postponing by a week his call for the Legislature to return for a special session. One reason for the delay was to see whether the PUC could seal a deal.

Over the next several days, the commission and utility lawyers hammered out the details of the $3.3-billion rescue plan, finalizing a deal about 11 p.m. Sept. 30.

"It would not have gotten over the finish line without her," said attorney <NAME/> Olson, an <NAME/> board member who helped represent the utility in the talks.

While those negotiations were going on, <NAME/> was going to extraordinary lengths to persuade the PUC to approve the other major item on the commission's plate: his proposal for the bond deal.

The issue is complex. But at its root, Lynch said, the proposal pushed by <NAME/> and Angelides to pay off the bonds would have the effect of locking in multiyear power contracts that the <NAME/> administration struck with independent power producers.

Lynch and several lawmakers contend that the administration is committing the state to buy too much electricity at excessive prices and seeking to limit the PUC's authority.

The PUC under Lynch has challenged aspects of the administration's power contracts in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Knowing that Lynch opposed the proposal, the governor tried to create a majority that would bypass her. He did not call Lynch, but did call Republican commissioners <NAME/> Bilas and <NAME/> Duque.

The governor's lobbying changed no votes; his proposal lost 4 to 1 with only Brown siding with him.

But his efforts appear to have enhanced Lynch's standing among her fellow commissioners, including the two Republicans, who are appointees of former Gov. <NAME/> <NAME/>.

Commissioners Praise Lynch

In Bilas' view, the call from the governor showed that Lynch had the mettle to vote against the administration proposal, even if it might cost her her job as PUC president.

"There are only two kinds of people who can serve: a yes man, or a person who believes that the commission was set up to be independent, and she is of the second type," Bilas said.

Brown, the only commissioner to vote for the administration's bond proposal, credits Lynch as well.

"She stood up for the authority of the PUC," Brown said. Brown--a cousin of <NAME/>' onetime boss, former Gov. Jerry Brown--is a potential successor to Lynch as president if <NAME/> decides to demote her. He has not been offered the post and does not want it, Brown said.

"I hope they don't remove her as president," Brown said. "She is a feisty, independent individual, but she is capable of enormous good work. If you appoint her, you have to take her on days you agree with her and days you disagree with her. She is not going to be a sycophant, and that is to her credit."

<NAME/>,
     The initial numbers from El Paso (as a Seller of their interest) would have equated to a 14 to 15x  EBITDA  with a valuation more in the range of $180m.  While we knew that they wouldn't be a buyer at that price, we expect that they would come in at $80-$90m.  They have yet to respond.  In the mean time, we are sitting on Deb's lowball (by her own admission) offer for two to three more days.

I know that in our meeting with <NAME/> and <NAME/> we talked about being creative on London reviews and leveraging what is being done by EAS - maybe directing them on additional activities and doing some leg work by video conference.

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.

I am really concerned over the lack of approvals from UBS of our contract formats as even when  we get them we have to still populate with the specific credit terms and then get them out into the market place.

Otherwise things are going okay and we hope to start trading again by mid feb. <NAME/> all is well with you and your family. I'll let you know next time I am in NYC.

the tigers' future looks pretty bright - esp with spurrier gone now.  how do you think they will be next year?

<NAME/>,

We called <NAME/> Limpers and talked about the services his company can offer to
<NAME/>. It seems that they don't have any great product sitting on the shelf. It's rather
a group of university professors who are ready to offer their brain power to solve different
problems of interest to potential customers. 

We talked about different potential projects and suggested in what ways they could
demonstrate their problem solving skills before we go into more detailed discussions.

They promised to get back to us in a few days.

<NAME/>,

I have to add another item to a long list of your headaches.

<NAME/> Whalley gave us marching orders to treat the development of quantitative
models for data mining of EOL trade records as the top priority.
I shall be providing <NAME/> bi-weekly updates on the project. 

FYI only. I am flying with <NAME/> next week to a meeting with a third party
that may be involved in some aspects of this project. I shall tell you more when
we meet.

I know that we, as well as <NAME/>, can count on full support and cooperation from you.

I shall ask my assistant, <NAME/> Crenshaw, to set up a meeting with you next week after I come back from
the trip.

<NAME/> University football practice was delayed for two hours yesterday in the midst of what was an anthrax scare. One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to look down and notice a unknown white powdery substance on the practice field. Third-year Blue Devils head coach <NAME/> Franks immediately suspended practice while the FBI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line. Practice was resumed when FBI special agents decided that the Blue Devils, winless in their last 22 games, would not be likely to encounter the substance ever, ever again.

You are going to have such a great time!  Yes, you will need a mixture of both long and short sleeves.  You might be able to take one pair of shorts, otherwise, jeans or other long pants will be the preferred leg coverings.  A sweatshirt and jacket will be just fine.  Is your jacket water wary?  Tennis shoes are definitely OK!

You will love the Tattoo and Edinburgh.  Find the Fringe Festival Schedule as soon as you get into town.  Look through the book and select a few events that look interesting to you and buy a ticket (there are signs everywhere or ask someone where the ticket offices are - there are several in town).  Entertainers all over the world come to the festival to get their start.  Some of the names you will probably recognize....they got their start there!

Call me when you get back.  I'd love to hear all about your trip!

Hugs back at you, <NAME/>.

P.S.  Stay away from Haggus(spelling?).

Nice presentation.  Look out Horowitz!!  My suggestions are attached.  Two other things:

1) If you're not fully prepared to defend the numbers on the "blunders" slide, I'd reconsider using it. There may be press there, and they may press you on them.
2) In place of the <NAME/> quote ("freedom fighter" may be viewed as somewhat over the top--though I'm in complete agreement--), you might try the J.S. Mills quote "When in doubt, always trust markets."

Finally, in these sensitive times, the term "hostage" may not be viewed as 100% sensitive.

Only if nuclear fuel storage problems persist.   The nuclear fleet, if unencumbered by NRC or spent fuel storage problems, will operate at 90-95% (95% during non-refueling years and 90% during re-fueling years).
 
Remember re-fuelings are now on a 24 month cycle and the next big cycle is spring and fall of 2003.   The 2002 re-fueling outages are actually less than normal.

<NAME/>,

Since the three nuclear units have gone down there has been a significant increase in imports into California from the northwest which coincides with increased hydro output.  This has continued to suppress Socal gas sendouts.    Grand Coulee outflows on Monday and Tuesday have exceeded inflows.  Monday: In-69.8, Out-73.4; Tuesday: In-57.7, Out 68.2.  The elevation is starting to creep lower.

Can you help us with these questions?  <NAME/> this drafting to continue?  What is the elevation target for the end of the month?  Why did yesterday's inflow decline so much?

Thank you,

Reagan,

Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.

Starting July 1 we implemented cost savings initiatives designed to reduce <NAME/>'s cost structure by over $200 million on an annual basis.  Additionally there has been a substantial amount of restructuring in both EBS and in EES to reduce costs and refocus our business on high value opportunities.  As <NAME/> has said, though, the basic business model and strategy of <NAME/> is sound and promises continued growth -- no changes there.  For example, in the <NAME/> Industrial Markets and <NAME/> Global Markets groups -- efforts begun just over a year ago -- we have already experienced enormous volume and revenue growth and we are making money already in these "first mover" businesses.  Successes like these prove the advantages of our overall strategy and business model.  Combined with some long overdue focus on costs, we should be well on our way to even greater gains in recurring earnings.

I have asked <NAME/> <NAME/> in our Credit Dept. here to get with the credit person there in London who worked up the credit worksheet to clear up the credit terms.

<NAME/>,
 
Thanks for securing the Astros tickets for Gas Logistics.  On Monday afternoon I had everyone gather and we had popcorn and a drawing for yesterday's seats, the extra seats for today and this Friday's opening Aeros game.  It turned out great.  Even though I followed this democratic process -- the winners turned out to be exactly the people I wanted to reward.  I also made sure to have a leader in each group to buy the snacks.  Yesterday <NAME/> took <NAME/> <NAME/>, Jerry Graves, and Tracy Minter,Toby Kuehl and <NAME/> Cramer.  Today Dannis Bellard, Dale Ratliff, Terry Kowalke and <NAME/> Chambers are going to the game.  It was a great morale builder.  Thanks.  We'll try to do this again next week if we have extra tickets (Astros cooperating of course).
 
Today, <NAME/> <NAME/> of FPL and <NAME/> Campbell of TECO-PGS are coming to town to go to the game with <NAME/> <NAME/> and I.  I'm also going to have a dinner for them after the game.  Perhaps at <NAME/>'s where hopefully <NAME/> and <NAME/> will join us.  I'll have Ricki leave you a message if you are interested in stoping by.
 
Early this AM I'll be out speaking at <NAME/>'s Ops conference.

As I previously shared, the result for vandium in the low-sulfer diesel (#2 fuel oil) came back at <0.1 ppm versus the "spec" of <0.05 ppm.  I just talked to the lab supervisor at Saybolt whom performed the analysis; and according to him there is no practical way of measuring the vanadium content more precisely than within one-tenth of a ppm.  

The only way he knows of is to use a NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) machine that NASA uses to analyze rocket fuel.  He is not sure whether or not the government would allow use of such a machine but estimates that, if they did allow, it could cost upwards of $10,000. 

Please let me know if we should pursue this matter any further.

I would be glad to have you ride with me -- just let me know which things you would like to attend.  My thoughts are that I will not attend for the entire day - through lunch looks like a good point at which to break and head back to the office.  Let me know what you want to do so that we can schedule meetings around your choices for Wednesday.  --<NAME/>

Calm down.  The operative word is it has been put on hold.  These are not normal times.  No one saw this coming or we could have planned better.  Give us a few days to figure everything out.  We just made the decision today to preserve cash while we were waiting to see what was going to happen.  Thanks for your cooperation which I desperately need right now.

stuff to you. <NAME/>'t call the jerk. Call the 800 number. You should

thanks Blair, we've been following the FR debate very closely.

Last week FERC staff recommended to the full commission that the FR contracts be converted to CD contracts, in effect abrogating a huge chunk of the original 1996 El Paso settlement.  The indicated shippers last year did file a Section 5 complaint against El Paso, accusing the pipeline of over selling its capacity.  This debate has been one of the biggest hindrances in getting shippers to commit to the Sun Devil project.

Greetings:

First, thanks for the pizza.  

Second, in line with the "role play" that you described in class and in the handout for the project, we took your direction to heart and tried to make our presentation slides very free of jargon, spreadsheets, reams of numbers, etc..  Given the end-of-semester work load, we, like everyone else, are very appreciative that we will only have to turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet for the project.  Given the change, if you would like, we would be happy to "beef up" the presentation to include more numbers, jargon and other technical gems, though the spreadsheet lays out most of that information pretty well.  Whichever way you prefer is fine by us.  Just let me know.

Best,
<NAME/>

I have tentatively booked us on the QE2 sailing from Southampton at 5pm on August 29, arriving New York at 7:30am on September 4.  You and <NAME/> have a Caronia class cabin at $2045.32 per person, including air from New York to London (with a business class upgrade on Continental).  I have a single in the same class (so we eat in the same restaurant).  My plan would be to fly over on Sunday evening - the 26th - since I have to be in Ohio that morning.  With that in mind I have also booked jr. suites for us at "41" the all-inclusive London hotel near Buckingham Palace that I've mentioned to you before.  They are at 275 GBP per night (2 nights).  Of course, if you guys wanted to go earlier to spend more time in London, I am sure that would be possible.

The difficulty is that <NAME/> has indicated an interest in staying in Europe longer - certainly understandable.  Her preference would be to go over on the boat leaving NY on September 5, arriving in Southampton Sept. 10 and then stay in Europe for a few weeks.  That doesn't work quite as well for me because I only have 6 vacation days left and on that routing I get one less day in London - i.e. we get off the boat on Monday morning and I have to fly back Tuesday morning.  On the other hand, we wouldn't be jet lagged on arrival in London!

They will hold the reservation until tomorrow.  What's your preference?

How goes it?  I hope good.  I just found out that <NAME/> is making Sprint Broadband Direct available to us at a discounted rate.  Isn't this the group you are working for now?  They will install the equipment for free and charge $24/mo ($14/mo if you sign up for Sprint Long Distance).  Do you have this?  If so, how do you like it?  Did you hear about Jessie?  Anyway, I just wanted to ask you about this.  I have dial-up now and it really sucks, but I'm a tight-wad and didn't want to pay what DSL costs.  Take Care.

We have three areas currently reserved for our bidders, what we will call Teams A, B & C.  The room situation is as follows:

Team A:  Main Conference Room 2991 = working phone
              Satellite Breakout Rooms, 2992 & 2993 
              
	There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supplies or office supplies

Team B:  Main Conference Room 32c2
               Satellite Breakout Rooms 3260 and Conference Room (unmarked) to the left thereof 

             Currently no working phones in this area.  There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supllies or office supplies

Team C:  Main Conference Room 3371 = has working phone.
              Satellite Breakout Room 3376 = no working phone.

                         Has coffee thermos's & some coffee cups & supplies, needs office supplies.


           I just met at noon with <NAME/> <NAME/> who handles, phones, faxes & furniture (x54423) and he is working on getting us phones, a fax machine, a non-network printer, and at least one laptop computer portal in each Team area.  After looking at the areas,  <NAME/> thought the easiest Team area to have completed FIRST would be the 29th floor area (it seems to have the right computer/phone jacks) WHICH HE WILL TRY TO GET COMPLETED BY THE END OF TODAY.  SECOND, we will target the 32nd floor.

We have a fourth area available after this for Team D:  a suite of smaller offices/conference rooms also located on 29, in 2945, 2946, 2947, and around the corner in 2940.  2946, a smaller office has a workable phone there, <NAME/>. We would need other phones installed there as well other the other equipment.

FYI.

currently Vice President -Regulatory Relations of Pacific Gas and Electric
Company, as Vice President - Special Projects, for PG&E Corporation,
effectively immediately.  Dede will report to <NAME/> Kline and will be
located in the PG&E Corporation Washington D.C. office.  <NAME/> Tomcala,
currently Director, Federal Governmental and Regulatory Relations of PG&E
Corporation, was elected today by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company Board
to replace Dede.

So it is correct to say that EES is responsible for the final bills?  If yes, how much $$ is this?

Hi, <NAME/>!

I just received a call from <NAME/> Croom who wants to send an updated ISDA draft to Avery Dennison Corp.  Can we use the same credit, or do you want to revise it?  He said he was going to meet with the counterparty on Tuesday, so I'm sure he either wants them to get the draft before then or he will take it with him.

Thanks!

This is pretty sensitive stuff.  We should talk about whether we need to distribute it at all and if so who should get it.  I have no ideal why Heizenrader is getting it.

I know you are both busy.  Lots of push back from London on Doorstep Reviews.  I recognize that our world is pretty crazy right now.  However, it is London's normal stance to push back on the reviews and work to the change the timing.  I think that they view being a subject of a Doorstep review as an elective procedure on their part.  

Next week I will follow up with you to get your thoughts on Doorstep efforts during the 4th quarter.  Wanted you to see my reply to Fernley below.  --<NAME/>

FYI....

I believe <NAME/> N. and <NAME/> had a conversation regarding help in the risk mgmt area.  I saw <NAME/> in the hallway earlier and he indicated that he wanted to rally with you and me to discuss. 
I've got two calls into <NAME/> Armstrong with SW Gas.  I hope to get him to send in a request this week.  Also, <NAME/> has been running numbers today, so I should have a term sheet for you tomorrow.  
The Agave Christmas Party is on Tuesday, December 11.  Is it possible to take a company plane out with reps from mgmt, mktg, gas logistics and operations?  
We are also running a few more scenarios for TransPecos.

Thanks, <NAME/>.

Remi, <NAME/>:


First of all I want to thank you for your hospitality and to apologize
for a delay in responding to you. It was quite a tumultuous week
and the turbulence continues.

The outline of commitments with the information on what I have done to 
jumpstart the process.

1.	Review of the CEPEL model / simplified model. Chonawee
started the review process, with the help of our two native Portuguese speakers.
Less complicated/faster to run model will follow.

2.	SDDP. As you know <NAME/> Halliburton is in Norway this week.
They put their grimy fingers on him first.
He will be back next week and will help you  to set up the SDDP runs.
He even volunteer to stay on the job for a few days longer to help
you with the project.

3.	Transmission modeling. <NAME/> Lin will call <NAME/> to jumpstart the process.

4.	Zimin will call <NAME/> regarding swing option model, option pricing models
for non-standard distributions and truncated distributions.

5.	Cooperation with the SA University in the area of the weather research 
	Remains to be discussed with <NAME/> and <NAME/>.

What is lily of the valley?  I don't know.  Would it add anything special to the coursage?  If so, I would be glad to spring for it.  I just don't know enough about flowers to make an educated call.  Could the florist tell you how wonderful it is for $60?  

<NAME/> and <NAME/> often have coursages and boutineers that coordinate - maybe only key for the "young set", and not those who buy pens to commemorate a 50th anniversary. White rose will be great if the florist feels like the coordinated thing would be weird.  We will be upgrading dad from a carnation, anyway.  

You know in the end, whatever you arrange will be terrific.  I don't mean for these comments to sound picky or ungrateful!!  (I am saving that in full force for later life -- only kidding!) --<NAME/>

<NAME/>:

I checked two other ENE subsidiary agreements and found:

(1)  We have successfully negotiated a limitation of liability clause (ENE's format)

(2)  We have been able to amend Par. 2 to "delete all references to affiliates of GS&Co, including the words "or any of your affiliates" and "each of your affiliates" wherever such words appear AND delete the words "without notice to Client " in the sixth line and replacing them with "without prior notice to Client, but with reasonable notice thereafter" AND deletethe last sentence of Section 2

(3)  Section 4: same as (2) above

Let me know if I can help further -

Some background information for the meeting with Mayor Brown:

Brown won 43% of the vote (to Sanchez' 40%) and is now in a run off with Sanchez.  <NAME/> Walden's perspective, not surprisingly, is that Brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters.  African American turnout in the election was lower than expected, but an active get-out-the-vote campaign could turn that around.
<NAME/> has supported the mayor with a $10,000 contribution.  I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances.
If you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration, you could:
Congratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition.
Compliment him on how he has responded to security issues since Sept 11 and his handling of flood relief.
(You should know that the <NAME/> police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the October 26 threat to the <NAME/> building.)
We have responded to the City's RFP for energy service.
EES made a presentation last week proposing a 5-7 year transaction
The city is opting for a 1-2 year transaction
That would require very detailed load data which is in Reliant's possession.
We have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the city's effort to do a deal with Reliant.  We have said that we won't play on those terms.
Separately, we are working with the city on a demand side deal.

Eddie,

Thanks for the note. This has been a very scary and tough time, but I'm hoping something good can come from it. We are trying very hard to sell the trading operation intact to several institutions. I'm sure you have read about it. After the suffering you and all the other people who live and work in the NYC financial district have gone through this year, this pales in comparision. We're all hangin' tough.

Best wishes in this holiday season to and your family,
your friend

Ay you may know, we had an explosion at our Teesside plant in

I hope to have a final decision on Monday morning when he comes back

<NAME/>,

For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.  

Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states "Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of "a single sum distribution" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to <NAME/> W. or <NAME/> L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.

<NAME/> <NAME/> and <NAME/> <NAME/> share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.

Here is some additional information since the circus closed down in Sacramento on Saturday morning.					

The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning, closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session.
The Assembly adjourned a few hours later, closing the regular session, but NOT the second extraordinary session.

The Legislature's options: 
1) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, they continue with the second extraordinary session, and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning.
2) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session, they begin a third extraordinary session, and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch.  However, they can pass a "waiver," which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning.
3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote.

In short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please.

Where to from here?
Through its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to <NAME/> that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an <NAME/> bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July.
Just before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that "...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'" and "...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end."  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out <NAME/>.  The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however.  
Given the Senate's view, and the open hositility between <NAME/> and <NAME/>, <NAME/>' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the <NAME/>' <NAME/> bill.  It is unclear at this time whether <NAME/> would play it that tough.
With the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday.  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive.
Finally, <NAME/> held a news conference this morning at which he said:
<NAME/> and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without "adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses."
He doesn't know why "the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session."
With all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail <NAME/> out and not the others.

If all this sounds ridiculous, it is.

We'll report back with additional information as we get it.

Best,
<NAME/>

hi emily,

i left fairly quickly on friday night - sorry i didn't say goodbye - i was in a strange mood, maybe being sick and drunk?  anyway, i feel like i should have socialized more there and regret not talking to janice more, but it was great to see earls people outside of earls amongst friends.  

why don't we go to YIM instead of the Space?  i'm happy to go to yoga with other people instead of alone and i can go to any yoga class and enjoy myself, although rockne gets on my nerves if i let him.  i think janice wants to come too?  

congratulations on passing all of your courses.  i found graduating to be somewhat anti-climactic - i wish you had a ceremony to go to, but maybe things are different in canada.  

i finished reading tuesdays with morrie - great book - it's good to be reminded of certain things in life.  

i did get your call last night but deleted your home number.  i called your cell, but no one answered and there was no voice mail for some reason.  can you send on your home number?

I had a long conversation with <NAME/> Dooley this afternoon.  She contacted me about finalizing the Con <NAME/> ISDA Master Agreement and the "related" Consolidated <NAME/>ison Energy (same lawyer, different commercial) master.  <NAME/> is preparing a new version.

We have a lot of open issues, most appearing on the open issue list that I just circulated to you both.  However, <NAME/> and I identified some significant credit issues which we should address now.

<NAME/>:  In addition to finalizing the credit matrix, the big ticket issues include the following items and (according to <NAME/>) you should probably call Triche <NAME/> right away to resolve as she is being moved to another project and may not be available for ISDA negotiations much longer:

(1)	credit event upon merger:  Con <NAME/> coming back with newer definition of "materially weaker". Con <NAME/> rejects ENA's proposal

(2)	Con <NAME/> is still rejecting our setoff language.  I will send our newer language but the substance is the same as before.

(3)	will not agree to our transfer language (i.e., always want to consent for purposes of transfer and no carve out for guaranteed affiliates)

(4)	want an extra day for delivering L/C's

(5)	issue about notification time for requesting collateral.  Con <NAME/> wants 1 pm NY time; we countered with 11 am NY time.

(6)	are insisting that parties obtain consent for substitution of collateral

(7)	major issue with respect to holding/using collateral.  Con <NAME/> will propose that with respect to ENA, only <NAME/> Corp. can hold collateral and <NAME/> Corp.'s eligibility to hold collateral will be tied to credit rating of BBB

(8)	major issue defining MAC: no one has come up with a MAC

Given my conversation of this afternoon, please let me know how you would like to proceed.  <NAME/>, will you be handling both Con <NAME/> entities?

I know that SCE is taking this position.  They are simple wrong.  Unless and until we get all of our "positive" CTC back from the Utility, why should I even begin to consider their "goofy" arguments.  In addition, SCE is receiving $3.3 B which is a full payment of all Negative CTC.  If their issue is to have a Undercollection charge against all customers, that's a different policy matter.  The CPUC agreed to the idea of Negative CTC and SCE needs to pay.  

Also, if we are 5% of load and the Undercollection is $3.3 B, I think that SCE would be looking for $165 MM - our entire claim.  They aren't talking about 5% from our view $150 MM claim.

Employees' performance will be evaluated at year end and feedback will be given to employees, but the PRC process itself and all of the many meetings that normally take place will be pared down significantly.  We want to give constructive feedback to employees while making sure that the majority of our time is focused on managing <NAME/>'s business.  HR should be sending information out soon to all employees on the details.  

The year-end bonus process is on track at this point, and it is the company's intent to pay bonuses.  It is also the company's intent to follow the process that we go through annually to review compensation levels relative to individual performance and to market data.  That process is slated for February, and at this point I am not aware of any anticipated changes to that.  

I am happy to answer your questions.  Feel free to send me others as the come up.  --<NAME/>

Hey <NAME/>,

I just wanted to verify that we are going to pull the 20 longest dated deals and get quotes from other dealers.  Is that correct?  Or are we going to have them on hand for when the contracts are terminated.... then get the appropriate quotes.

Hi, <NAME/>!

Just received a call from <NAME/> at XTO Energy and he is going to be sending an e-mail with their comments to the ISDA.  He said there were just a handful, but we'll see.  I'll forward his e-mail to you when I receive it.

Have a good weekend!

Hey guys and girls,

<NAME/> has a Sheraton on the outskirts of town booked on the front end of the trip.  I sent 17 faxes this morning to hotels in the city center looking for something closer to our sights.  I received an immediate response from the Hotel Condotti.  They have 3 standard rooms available.  I believe it is a 3+ star hotel (I'm guessing from the prices they charge).  From the article in my book, they have recently remodeled.  They are located near our Hotel Firenze between the Spanish Steps and Plaza <NAME/> Popolo.  The rate is 430,000 Lire (approximately $215).  It's $25 more than the Sheraton but we won't have to taxi between the city center and the outskirts of town which gives us more flexibility to easily scoot back to the hotel as we fade with jetlag and eat dinner in town after a nap.  They also have a 72 hour cancellation policy (there could be a slight fee to cancel, their fax just says they have a 72 hour cancellation fee), if we are OK, I'll confirm this cancellation with our reservation. 

I think we should go with this.  I'm not sure how fast I'll hear from the others, if at all.

Please let me know your thoughts ASAP. 

Thanks, <NAME/>.

A few comments on the state of our VaR models. The issues always become more
controversial during the periods when vols and positions increase and I would
like to share with you a few observations.

1. Critical importance of a  good risk management system to
<NAME/> (and the P/E ratio).

A number of recent analysts' reports characterized <NAME/> as a hedge fund engaged in
massive directional trading and representing huge risks to investors. One way to counter this
crirticism is to emphasize the quality of <NAME/>'s risk amnageemnt system and
our strong risk amangeemnt culture.  Our claims regarding the strong risk management
technology and culture should be, however, supported  by reality.

It is critical that we continue to improve our risk management systems and also can
convince the external parties (stock analysts, creditors,  credit rating agencies) about
the quality of our financial technology. This can be done 
through targeted disclosure of the elements of our technology, as we have done frequently in the past.
by reality.

2. Inputs from the trading desks vs. historical calibration.

The VaR system used in <NAME/> is based on the assumption that as much input
information as possible should come from the market (i.e. trading desks), or should be calibrated to
the market observations (as opposed to historical data).

One immediate improvement: we should review inputs that are not based on the trading desks
information and move, if possible, to replace them with market based, forward looking data.

One should not assume, of course, that the information coming from the
trading desks is perfect. One problem that is persistent in some portfolios is the disconnect
between the posted forward vols curves and subsequent fluctuations in the forward prices 
curves. The forward vols curves should be relatively unbiased expectations of future realized 
forward price volati;oty. If this is not the case, back testing for some portfolios will 
systematically fail. 

One way to address the problem is to implement a module that compares systematically
fwd vols posted by the trading desks with subsequent price movements. It will allow us to identify the 
source of problems we see in some books.

3. VaR process management.

Given the size of our trading operation, we are running a VaR factory,
a system designed to produce timely risk assessment for all the portfolios.
What is missing is the industrial type process that guarantees the quality
of the results.

Specifically, I am concerned about absence of one person vested with the responsibility
for the model calibration. Right now this responsibility is dispersed in the organization
and resides somewhere between the IT, RAC and Research. As a result we have
inputs updated inconsistently and without proper quality controls. Some inputs used 
currently in the system are 2 years old.

Another aspect of this problem is prioritization of different projects. In my view 
some recent modification to the system tied up IT resources and were of marginal
usefulness (and in some case on questionable
understanding of mathematics). Of course, I can be wrong but there is was no systematic process to
bring these issues to the table, in a meeting involving all the concerned parties

I would like your advice on this matter.

Dear Grandmother,

So sorry we didn't make it  yesterday.  We went shopping, and Cameron hurt his finger while he was riding on the shopping cart  -- nothing major, but it distracted me so much that all other things left my mind.  Oops!!!

Morela,
I don't know if you got this:

Brazil's Cenibra getting $100 million investment to expand pulp
09/25/2001 10:05:35, SABI 
Brazil, Sept. 24, 2001 (Gazeta Mercantil) -- After investments of US$650mil to take the control of woodpulp producer Cenibra, the consortium JBP (Japan Brazil Paper and Pulp Development Co) has decided to expand business. Cenibra will receive US$100mil investment to increase its capacity at Belo Oriente facility, Minas Gerais state, from the current 800,000 to 1 million tonnes per year. In 2000 the company registered R$838.6mil net earning, and R$229mil net profit. Its net worth reached R$609.6mil.

Thanks <NAME/>.   I think <NAME/> would fit in with our group well.   I probably need to wait at least a week to let the dust settle on our own people issues.    My guess is we will end up losing 2-3 people and outside candidates then become viable.

I think you will find much more demand than you think for engineers, although the economy is suffering at the moment. It does not sound like this lady has her act together. I wish I knew more about biomedical engineers. You should talk to the head of the dept. and ask who is big in the industry and send them all letters with a resume attached. <NAME/>'t worry at all about your resume right now, it is almost irrelevant. Your grade point average and salutatorian are relevant. There are very few female engineers in the workplace which will help you a lot. You could work for companies like <NAME/>, Exxon, Shell for example but it would not be in your major. My guess is the major pharmaceutical firms may hire you but you need to research this. The first stop should be the head of the department. Lets talk more on this topic. Love, Dad

Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;

(i) Correct, and 
(ii) Correctly allocated

Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from <NAME/>.

<NAME/>

Bit of an issue here.  I had thought we were marking purely the intrinsic value of the options due to their illiquid nature.  I really think we need to mark these down to real values unless we can prove out the value by selling a proportion of the warrants into the market.

We also clearly have a write down from the number on the balance sheet which is way too high. 

Please could you evaluate the warrants and come up with a proposal of how we deal with them.

<NAME/>,

Two items:

1.  I spoke to <NAME/> McKay about Sumas.  His views seem well thought out.  He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st.  See attached spreadsheet.  In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10.  But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85.  Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40
	His winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand. See attached spreadsheet.  Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't  support that premium.
	In conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book.


 
2.  I will stay after the meeting to talk about <NAME/> G's issues.

My thoughts.
 
I would change the section "Reliability" to "Operations".  The Current framework is Non-standardized;  Poor Seams Interface
 
Under Access to Transmission I would change it to say that "Not all Users on the System take service in a non-discriminatory manner."  Utilities can't discriminate versus like users.
 
Under Generation - I would change "optional" to Optimal.
 
I don't also understand the 99%.  Easier to say 100%*   * - Public Power recipricoity issues.

Oh yes, it was a good contest.  Gannon is quite the quarterback.  Did you?  I only watched the first half, though, because I was tired and went to bed.  Today, I'm watching our stock go to shit once again.  It's only a matter of time before we shut the doors.  I think the only thing that will keep us from going under is that the industry would get hurt too much.  Maybe the government will bail us out.  Anwyay, how's everything with you?

hey,

i don't have your phone number at work.  i have some bad news - i'll be flying out 3 days 
later than i told you before.  either my booking got screwed up or i never booked the flight!
i think it got lost on the internet some where, but i can't even remember what airline it was
on, so it's impossible for me to check!  just booked a one week flight and i'll be coming 
out on the 19th.  i'm still going to take the days off from work and relax in calgary a little,
which is good.  

by the way, if you haven't already gotten me something, i thought of a xmas present.  
a squash raquet.  lots of people play here and i'm looking to get into it.   

number here is 403 974 6946 if you want to chat.

I understand all of those comparisons, however, the reality is if we lose <NAME/> (which we will if we don't pay 65k + 10k), we will end up hiring a replacement at 75-80k.   This is pretty easy math for me.

This cpy was on the 10/5/01 list with a note "replacing profile for BP Exploration & Oil Inc."  We've got a few issues here.  First, we just can replace profiles.  If it is a simple a a name change or some mergers, maybe.  Is this?  If it's not, we may have to assign the trades over.  I know I've got a financial master with BP Exploration & Oil Inc.  I just can't move the profile.

What's the scoop here?  I have no records of a name change/merger here, do you?

Hi, Roeline:

No, I haven't received any original documents from Sempra.  If he sent them here I would surely have them by now.  Thanks for sending your copies--now I can get a big pile off my desk too.

We are trying to hold our own over here, hoping to miss the first round of layoffs.  It is still so incredibly unbelievable that this is happening.  It seems like a bad dream and any minute we will awaken.  It's supposed to be "business as usual" but it's pretty hard to get into the swing of things.  Hopefully everything will work out.

Have a Happy Thanksgiving!

Thanks for your patience. We are working hard on getting Coral and BP North America on board with the ring trades.

I have another counterparty that may want to ring out some ATM Chicago basis. Let me know about that.

I have also enclosed the language that would tie all these trades together.

I think it would be useful to get in touch with the HR leadership and review what is being done and get their ideas on what they think should be done.  More than anything I want the organization to know who to go to with their ideas and cut down on the noise level and the perception that we aren't doing anything.

the Red Hawk lateral as a separate item.  <NAME/> had already run the economics using $843mm plus a 5% risk adjustment adder for the Capex for a total of $885mm.  I think we have enough pad in this thing to take care of the error.

<NAME/>,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to <NAME/>, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.

The FERC is presently deliberating on more restrictive rules, but I'll answer in the context of the current rules.

There are three main principles behind the current rules:
1. Pipeline can't share shipper information with affiliate
2. Pipeline can't share transportation info with affiliate -- unless pipeline is willing to publicly post info, and
3. Pipeline and affiliates must operate as separately as reasonably possible.

There is no prohibition on the pipeline having affiliate information, but the real root of your question is whether the entities are operating separately.  For example, pipeline gets forward price curve info from affiliate -- we'd argue that this is just info that helps pipeline do its job better.  But, compare with scenario where pipeline has a detailed list of all affiliates sales obligations - price, terms, etc. -- the argument can be made that the entities are not operating separately and the only reason that the pipe has this info is to favor affiliate business.  There was a real case to this effect.  The pipeline & affiliate attended a joint strategy meeting each morning.  The pipeline claimed that it only listened during the meeting.  FERC found that the pipeline and affiliate were not operating separately and fined the pipeline.

So, I'd say that the rules are asymmetric for the case where the pipeline wants access to research/training/historical type info, but probably symmetric when it comes to matters of day to day contracts of transactions.

I would like to discuss a change of management for EnronOnline under the Netco scenario.  I believe that we have a very short period of time to get EnronOnlne back up and running and with this in mind it may be preferable to change out the management sooner rather than later.  I think there is a lot of preparation work which can be done now.

Can we discuss?

Here is the latest on our search for a new condo.  Search Over!  Due to the recent drastic fall in the <NAME/> stock price, $90 in Jan. to $8.50 today, we have postpone our search.  So we will have to look for a place to stay.  Rental rates may be too expensive in Vail, so we may have to look else where.  We are off to a late ski season this year, it's November 7th and it is very warm here.   I'll start looking for leads on housing.  I also have a paid trip to Cancun in February the 21st - 24th.  Keep me posted on everything.

<NAME/>:

Lehman called to discuss the two (2) forwards on 9/28/01 (2,245,761 shares at $56.7925 and 2,434,339 shares at $67.5243, respectively) and roll of the 9/18/01 400,000 share forward into the new forwards.  It appears that you also rolled all of the five (5) remaining forwards which terminated on 10/3/01 into the two new forwards.

Lehman is sending three new confirmations for the foregoing transactions.

Please verify with deal tickets.  I have the ticket for the 400,000 share trade.

Also, can you please verify final confirm format (i.e., blackline sent noon on 9/26/01).  I have <NAME/>'s comment for "material information".

Thanks.

This could be very dangerous.  

OPG controls all the megawatts.  

They could set the price high and we wouldn't have the ability to do anything about it.  If you could use British energy and get some deal done with OPG to hedge us maybe we would for a few months.

Dear <NAME/>,

My associate, <NAME/> Leppard, sent me a message about a conversation he had with you 
regarding books on quantitative aspects of trading different commodities.

I shall be very glad to talk to you about different approaches we can take (books ranging from
a very general introduction to different commodity markets to highly technical treaties) and
about the contribution  <NAME/> could make.

You can take a quick look at the book published by Risk magazine, "Managing Energy
Price Risk", 2nd edition. This collection of papers was probably the best selling book Risk published
so far. It is a good starting point to a conversation about different  options you might consider.

Please, feel free to give me a call. My direct number is 713 853 3848.

Here in lies the problem.  These fix price locks are not deal specific - rather counterparty specific.  Therefore, we can not modify prices until the end of the month when we know which deals flowed volumes and which did not.  This means we have to do this the last two days of the month along with all of the other things we are doing.  For every month since May - except September we have been able to do this.  It just so happens the one time we do not do it, we had the most locks.  The problems we had in previous months were due to liquidations hitting central that should have hit Chicago.  Same deals, different issues.  Thanks.

Do not proceed with any action relating to a potential auction of financial trading contracts.  You will need to have the process approved internally, with the creditors' committee and by our bankruptcy lawyers.

I have copies of "processes" which were implemented by the physical power group which you may want to see and use as a template.

A couple of other ideas of things we might ask for (in addition to pulling this without comment from anywhere it is posted and committing to decline any representation against us in these matters):

1.  How many (who?) have responded to this?  Shouldn't we have the opportunity to clear the conflict?
2.  Commit to not give advice on any similar matter without inquiring as to the party on the other side (i.e. no "no-names" advice on these issues).

Federal price limits backfire
Some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps
<NAME/> Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Wednesday, July 4, 2001
?2001 San <NAME/> Chronicle 
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/chronicle/archive/2001/07/04/MN186091.DTL 
Officials in California and Nevada, after months of lobbying for federal regulators to cap Western power prices, warned yesterday that the newly imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of blackouts in the two states.
The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling blackouts yesterday afternoon, and one day after the first-ever rolling blackouts in Las Vegas forced energy-hungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduce air conditioning.
The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a closer look at the so-called price mitigation plan and come up with revisions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages.
"We need some clarity to this order," said <NAME/> Hidalgo, a spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources, which is spending billions of dollars to keep the state's lights on.
"Generators need to be held accountable," he said.
The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages, yet power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rates during periods of high demand.
Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the expense of shipping electricity from state to state. Each mile that electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost.
"No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps," said <NAME/> Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association in Menlo Park.
Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls are in effect.
"This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not having enough," Ackerman said. "It increases the threat of blackouts."
BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED
California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert about an hour later, after finding additional supplies.
"Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts," said <NAME/> McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power network.
The Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their lights.
<NAME/> Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said that the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating Monday's shortage.
"We're looking very closely at this," he said. "There seems to be a potential for unintended consequences."
Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less- efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishing, under capped prices.
"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this," he said.
The federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $92 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because of the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101.
Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls have extended California's power crisis to neighboring states.
"California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus," he said.
'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES'
California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot withhold output.
"The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan)," said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources.
Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal regulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let supply and demand determine costs.
Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line number provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergencies.
"No one answered," he said. "They were closed."
State officials tried again yesterday, and this time were told that the commission would look into the matter. They were not given a time frame for when the commission might come up with a response.

Out-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 3, 2001)
Confused by the federal government's new controls on electricity prices, generators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts, state officials said.
The confusion began when the state's electric grid operators declared a Stage 1 power alert in the early afternoon, triggering the price caps for the first time since they went into effect June 21.
Out-of-state generators pulled about 1,500 megawatts of electricity off the table at midafternoon, enough to power about 1.1 million homes, because of uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pricing system, said <NAME/> Hidalgo, spokesperson for the state Department of Water Resources. The department buys electricity for the state's financially distressed utilities.
"They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusion over the FERC order," Hidalgo said. "We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear."
The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced California to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said. Rolling blackouts hit southern Nevada.
Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a variable price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power market. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiting profits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity. And as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.
"That's the risk that you run (with price controls)," said <NAME/> O'<NAME/>, editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. "People want any kind of certainty at all."
Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute imports from the Bonne=07ville Power Administration, the federal agency that markets government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The state went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackouts are ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.
The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.
FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The price fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient plant operating in California during a "power alert" declared by the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid. When there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was established during the latest alert.
Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour in California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early afternoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.
Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many California power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew by how much until the price was posted by the ISO.
The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $98 in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a credit risk in selling to the state.
O'<NAME/> said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every time the ISO declares a power alert.
In-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. But out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the out-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.

Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs
Electricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to sell to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it.

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer

     SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted several electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday afternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.
     The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to supply more than 1 million homes, said <NAME/> Hart, deputy director of the California Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the state's electricity since January.
     At least five companies producing or marketing power "are telling us that since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not going to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy," Hart said.
     The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in summer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency, meaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since May 31.
     Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission intended to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power emergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that applies to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.
     The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run the most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.
     But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price is supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that apparently drove away sellers, Hart said.
     Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that had committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit of the San <NAME/>-based energy conglomerate.
     Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare a Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy commission's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and when it should take effect. They got no answer.
     Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clarify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power suppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency.
     Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when it is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the price of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped lately.
     Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators had anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Ore., had agreed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower each hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this summer.
     "Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through," Hart said.

Filing looks good.  My vote is go forward with a clean 205 filing as attached.
 
If we file the 203 as well, FERC will gravitate directly toward that.   I think we retain more flexibility if we stick with the 205 approach.
 
Other thoughts?   I will be in Florida (vacation) Wednesday through Friday.    I can be reached via cell and TJ will have my hotel phone #.    In addition, I will check e-mails at least once per day at the hotel business center.

The only thing I have to add, if this is our premise, <NAME/> Field Services is not an "owner" of the Blanco Hub.  Only PNM, NWPL and Transwestern are owners and should be the only parties that can transport gas across the hub header system without a fee (because they are in effect transporting on their own pipeline).  I'm wondering if it's appropriate for WFS to have a "hub" agreement, if the purpose is for the Operator (TW) to be able identify transactions scheduled across the hub on the owners' capacity.

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

Thank you,

<NAME/> --

Please examine closely the attached note from the CalPX.  In the letter
they appear to want some guidance on how to allocate the refunds to
buyers or they'll simply decide.  This is a quote ---

d.	Allocation of refunds to demand (buyers).  As part of these
proceeding the method of allocation of refunds to buyers must be
addressed.  CalPX proposes to use its share-fraction allocation method
to determine how to spread the refunds among its participants if there
are no specific Commission orders on how to allocate the refunds.

Please let me know the implication and if the CAISO has a similar
provision in its tariff.

This is the interest rate curve we used to value our book as of Close of business Oct. 15, 2001. Our Treasury guys are either not available now or are not working anymore. So for getting the term structure of <NAME/>'s funding costs for 10/15/01 I probably can't deliver that today. I still think your money desks and corporate traders could give you a pretty realistic picture of that. I will keep trying though.

I was speaking yesterday with <NAME/> <NAME/>.  He indicated that we continue to have (or may have soon) litigation surrounding our ownership interest in Cornhusker.  

This is important primarily because the Texas Public Utility Code requires that the PUC approve any merger of generators that will have a combined ownership of over 1% - which Dynegy and <NAME/> will have.  

I want to make sure that we represent our ownership interest to the PUC appropriately given the current dispute.  If you have any specifics, please let me know or give me a call.

I would modify this document slightly.  The first section is titled "Introduction to Risk Management" and the second section is "Hedging Instruments/Risk Management Products".  However, many of the bullet points in the first section are describing hedging instruments that belong in second section.  I would limit the introduction to types of risk, identifying risk, and examples when risks are not hedged.  Then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools.  Definitions of derivatives and how they can be used to manage the risk in the first section would be in this section.  The third section would include the roles and accounting basics.  You might want to include the commodity 101 info here, at least gas and power.

Per our discussions yesterday, I did find an Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. Order On Rehearing in my file, dated August 5, 1997 in Docket No. RP97-126-002 (80 FERC P61,199) concerning scheduling alt FT by price.  On reviewing it again, some key points were:  

	Allocate based on the highest percentage of the maximum rate - the rate used being the rate for the package of services that includes those secondary rights.
	The Commission maintains that all firm capacity, once scheduled, be curtailed pro rata, without regard to price.

Panhandle also filed on March 14, 1997 for scheduling alt FT by price at Docket No. RP97-291 (it's referenced in footnotes, but I don't have a copy of the filing).

On August 16, 2001, <NAME/> counsel in DC requested that the <NAME/> Northwest cash desk pull together a tremendous amount of data for part of the 2001 operating year.  The data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for, and for the most part, <NAME/>'s internal systems did not track the information in the format requested.  Since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money, it was imperative that (1) the data be pulled together, even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible; (2) the data be as accurate as possible, and; (3) it be done in a very short period of time.

The amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive.  Utilizing <NAME/>'s comprehensive, and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems, we were able to accomplish this task.  There were many instances where we hit a "brick wall".  Specifically, it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset, although it was imperative we do so.  <NAME/> was instrumental in bridging this gap.

As a result of her efforts, we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in DC, and subsequently for our FERC filing.  I recommend that <NAME/> receive a Personal Best Award for the amount of $2,000.

<NAME/>,

Can you authorize access to the west power site for <NAME/> Holtz.  He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?

Thank you,

<NAME/>,

Here is a short letter that indicates I will give consent contingent to the items we discussed.  I didn't make any reference to why I took the utilities out of my name.
I left that for you to explain to her that we need to have a cutoff date so we can calculate the final amount.  I hope you can make her understand that I have not been obligated to keep these in my name for some time.  Since my attorney is out of town until Monday and I doubt that she has all the documents in place to actually place the property in a limited partnership (certainly not the 1st lienholders consent) we will have to work together next week.  

If you want to modify this letter let me know.  I am also faxing you a sign copy.

Now that the auction is underway and the possibility of being purchased in very high, we need to get back in gear, TODAY.

1.	Everyone needs to be here no later than 8:00am, 7:30 once we start trading again
2.	No playing on the internet or other games (ex. cards) - this will no longer be tolerated
3.	I have said this many times before but this is the ideal time to LEARN.
		bring in your options books or anything else that you can read to learn more about the energy industry
		start studying the firms rolls, learn what the macros do, develop new checks and balances
		become more familiar with forwards and options details and other excel queries and where the curves come from
		understand the curve files (these will change but the general format will be similar)
		
Just to be clear, this is coming down from <NAME/> Gossett.  
The list for NetCo. is not set in stone and can be changed if someone steps up, or if someone doesn't.

We are still getting paid everyday and should be putting our time into the company.
I know it has been boring but things need to change starting today, things will start to pick up in the next few days.

The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14th.

I would like to get your ideas for changes/improvements to our current processes/systems.  We have a slightly improved firm roll to use but nothing else has changed.
This is our chance to change the things we couldn't before.  There is no reason why we have to continue doing things the same as before.

Please seriously think about this over the next few days and get back to me with any ideas you have, no matter how small, every little bit helps.

Come talk to me if you have any questions or concerns,

Thanks,
<NAME/>

Why can't I consume alcohol on Atkins? You should not drink alcohol during Induction, but you can drink moderate amounts of alcohol during the Ongoing Weight Loss, Pre-maintenance and Maintenance phases of the Atkins Nutritional Approach. When given the choice, your body will burn alcohol for energy before it burns fat. But alcohol does not act as a carbohydrate so it will not interfere with burning fat in the same way that sugars and other carbohydrates do. 
Alcohol consumption may also increase yeast-related symptoms, such as bloating, gas and cravings for sweets, and can therefore interfere with weight loss. Beer, which contains yeast, probably has the most yeast-forming components of any alcohol. An occasional glass of wine or vodka is the best choice. Scotch and other grain-based spirits are more likely to promote yeast problems. 
Note: Use only mixers that contain no sugar or fruit juices. Even tonic water contains carbs and regular soda is made with sugar. Seltzer, club soda, mineral water and non-aspartame diet sodas are better alternatives.

I'm big seller of interventions.  they tend not to work.  if the gas market wants to go lower, enron coming out and buying 10,000 contracts is not going to stop the market from going down.  maybe in the short term, but that's it.  same with currencies.  ECB can come out and transfer some of its foreign reserves from dollars to Euros, but they are limited by their currency reserves unless they want to act in the futures market at which point they have to exit that position at some point.  i think it is more psychological than anything.  i think overall market interventions have been extremely ineffective.

We have submitted your request for $30 million of UK Power VAR to the Board for approval. I thought about this issue a lot before doing so because I don't feel we are fully in control of the infrastructure there and a large limit can add to the danger.

<NAME/>:

Have you received a W8BEN tax form and/or a legal opinion from Nemak?  They are supposed to deliver these to us in connection with the signed ISDA Master Agreement, but I haven't seen them and before I contact them, I thought I'd check just to make sure you didn't receive them.

Thanks!

After talking with <NAME/>, I intend to set up a meeting to provide complete matrices on licensing and utility contracts sometime early during the week beginning Dec 3.  

Also, just to make sure everyone is clear, <NAME/>, <NAME/>, and <NAME/> are on point during the next few weeks to ensure that that EES and/or EPMI responds timely to any request for info, additional security, or other utility matters.  This, of course, will continue to require help from legal, credit, and operations.

If anyone has any other questions, please give me a call.

Thanks.

<NAME/>, sorry for the short notice to try to catch up with you in L.A. this week.  As mentioned, I am responsible for the Gas Marketing efforts in the West. For a variety of reasons we have been slow in contacting you but I know that from a Trading perspective you have a strong relationship with our staff and were probably getting covered on most items you were needing. 

My groups interests are around transportation, risk management, Strategic Assets, storage etc... .items that we believe are more of a term fit that real time position management issue.  

We spend a lot of time on fundamentals, research, hedging strategies, load forecasting etc.

You had mentioned being in town in early November and if your schedule allows I would welcome the chance to get together.

Please contact me as you know your calendar and in the interim.... if I end up in the city prior to the end of the month, I may try to contact you then.

Thanks in advance.

Hi, Gennaro!

I'm trying to pull all these documents together so that we can have them re-executed and I noticed that the Euroclear single Pledgor Pledge Agreement attached is not the same version we signed.  The version we signed in RG500b(Pledgee's Representative version - 1998 Edition).  Do you have this version that you can send to me?

Thanks!

auntie:

i think it will be easy to get back into the swing of thigns -- sitting on my ass for two months has been a nice distraction, but its gotten really boring.  trading is exciting and i'm looking forward to it - should be like jumping into a cold pool.  i'm actually doing real work lately which is great.  i still have no idea what you do at work.  anything interesting?  

yes, the new babe lair should be sweet - we'll need auntie's recommendations.  just make sure you shit in jai's toilet.  it might be harder for you than me, but peeing on the toilet seat is always a good way to get your message across - as a woman, i think it would send an especially clear signal.  are you stopping by this weekend?  i'm having a couch delivered on sat between 10 and 2, so i think we'll be around then for sure.  

5 times a day is no problem, but 5 times a day seven days a week might be a push, but with the right stimulation anything is possible.  is chrissy a 5x7 kind of chick?  wow.  and, of course, retention is always an interesting experiment.  

we'll have to go to big wally's - especially if its not my style.  i haven't spent much time in kensington, but it seems like there are some good spots there.

The Senate Rules Committee just met.  During the hearing, Senate Leader <NAME/> <NAME/> stated that:
the Senate intends to rewrite the version of the MOU that the Assembly approved last Thursday night and sent over to the Senate for final approval (SB78).
the version of the MOU that will emerge from the Senate sometime this week will look much more like the bill that originally passed out of the Senate prior to the July summer recess.  That bill was unacceptable to <NAME/> and <NAME/>, which led to the version that the Assembly developed and approved last Thursday night.
If the Senate proceeds as <NAME/> suggests, the chances are very low that an MOU will make it through the Legislature and get <NAME/>' signature.
<NAME/> generally sticks to his word. But there is still time for additional negotiations and SB78 could squeak by. However, <NAME/>'s comments in the Rules Committee certainly don't help 78's chances for survival.
Finally, the Assembly is currently debating the last surviving windfall profits bill, and the bill is having a hard time getting the votes necessary for passage.  More information on the windfall profits bill as we get it.

Best,
<NAME/>

Last week it would have been two cents, but now that there is a huge credit spread in the market, it may cost them .07.  We simply can't buy the physical volumes right now.  The credit spread in the SJ to cover our short is costing us .20.

When you get back in the office, let's talk about the new interest to connect into the SJ Hub.  I, too, have a few customers who are interested in connecting into the Hub.  We should generally discuss this from a big picture perspective so we can understand the total limitations of the Hub and lay out our strategy for moving forward.

Also, FYI, in your EDG comment below, our pipeline profile has all the lat/long locations specified if that helps identify the locations best for power plant sites.

No, we live about 2-3 mi. off I-10.  It is really easy to get to our house from <NAME/> by taking 71 to I-10 east. 


Here is a turn by turn:

Exit 1-10 at Highway 6 (17 mi. West of Downtown <NAME/>).  

Go South on Hwy 6 to the 3rd stop light (Chevron station on SE corner).  Take right onto Briarforest Drive.  Take first left onto Briarhome (Meadowbriar subdivision).  We live on Scarborough Fair -- third street off Briarhome.  Our home is 2-story red brick & is in the NE corner.

Everything that we use is located in P:/Scheduling.  You will find old sheets with tags and paths, documents outlining how the system works, how daylight savings time needs to be represented, there is also the Intranet site

P:\Scheduling\EnronWestSchedulingWebsite.html

On this there is the OATI links, and also the test site for OATI 1.7.  This will go live in April, and will be totally different than any tagging done before. You will need time to get familiar with the new format and practice, and I will be happy to help guide you when you are ready.

All 3 of us are here to help, and will be available to you until you are comfortable.

Good Luck!

Gerry, I talked to both storey and Lucci late friday... here is the latest.  You had indicated your customer wanted a monthly related price... is that off of Ventura or Harper or both.   

<NAME/> Lucci ( <NAME/> office) will contact you today or Tues., to generate a bid for the Ventura and Harper gas. I talked to storey on Friday and he will work up a firm bid for your customers.   He thinks pricing will be near a Ventura Monthly Index + $ .04. ( that's with no orig to Canada).  That is also with no ancillary deals behind this structure and that is what Lucci is trying to pull together. <NAME/>, can you please investigate nom procedures, potential dry run structure ( Oct. 01) and verify what the structure looks like as the upstream diversions take place.( incl. default positions ).    

At a minimum let's buy the gas and sell it base load to storey.... then ENA - <NAME/> will try to back fill some gas into the deal on a Interruptible basis.

Call if you guys want to discuss. 

regard,  BT

i think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here.  still dont think this is equilibrium.  need to see aga coming in lower than expectations for a couple weeks signaling that we've moved down the demand curve.  think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get close to the psychological 400 target.  market needs producer selling to get us through there.  have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett : hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently.  still going lower but it will be a tougher move from here.

I agree with <NAME/> Shelk to not attack the CBO report.

While the CBO again and again relies upon academic studies to state that generators "may" have withheld power, the basic argument is that "DEREGULATION ITSELF NOT FAIL; RATHER, IT WAS NEVER ACHEIVED."   In addition, the paper states that "MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHES TO THE STATE'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN -- BUT NOT TO ITS OBJECTIVE, ELECTRICITY DEREGULATION."

In addition, California's response of "DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET -- A RESPONSE THAT COULD PROVE COSTLY TO ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS."

I hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat on the Refund case.  The CBO has now stated publicly that the fundamental market conditions and the State's poor plan and actions created the financial and political crisis.  The CBO finds that "WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY PRICES WERE HIGHER THAN THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A TRADITIONALLY REGULATED MARKET OR A MORE FULLY DEREGULATED MARKET"..because "FEATURES OF THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN LIMITED THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDES OF THE ELECTRICITY MARKET."

Seems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out (together with our details of the policy failures).  This CBO report clearly undercuts the "political" arguments of the <NAME/> administration who had every opportunity to fix the plan and who has now not only bought into horrible long-term contracts but has passed through 100% of the high costs to consumers.

<NAME/> do the best we can.  As ENW, we utilize the Analyst pool much more heavily than the Associates pool.  Several of us from ENW nterviewed Analyst candidates for Fastastic Friday on October 26 (including me).  I believe that we have a number of ENW managers committed to the November 16 Fantastic Friday interviews for Analysts.  

Most Associates rotations are commercial rotations, so it would seem to make sense to have commercial teams heavily involved in the November 3 and December 1 Super Saturdays.  

What would be the time commitment on Saturday?  --<NAME/>

I'm starting to get concerned about this.  A) I didn't pick the time.  B) I talked to <NAME/> on Friday and she will be out of Church at 10 AM PDT and on the call shortly thereafter. <NAME/> seemed more concerned about having a call at all then on the time.  If she expressed a view that the time was set up so that she couldn't be on the call, I'd like to discuss, since that didn't factor in at all.

As you know, having gone through <NAME/>, I'm extremely sensitive to inter-group relations.  If you feel there are issues that we should discuss, I'd really like to do it.  I react very strongly to any view that I am intentionally doing anything to get in <NAME/>'s---or others---way.  From my perspective, I feel strongly that I haven't behaved that way, and don't in any way intend to.  I simply have no desire to "compete" with colleagues, <NAME/> in particular.  There aren't enough people to do all the work, and there's plenty of tasks, recognition, blame, etc. to go around.

These are extremely challenging times and we won't get anywhere unless it's truly a team effort.  I know that the SF office has a history of challenges with respect to California leadership. I have no interest in returning to the very un-teamlike atmosphere that existed previously, particularly since the atmosphere has changed so positively in the past few months.  For a variety of reasons, I have been asked to take on alot of tasks over the past year. I've tried very hard to perform well, while at the same time working hard with <NAME/> and <NAME/> to advance a significantly more healthy, inclusive, open and collegial working environment in California and the West.  

I care alot of course about your perceptions, and if you have the preception that relations in the office is becoming an issue, I'd like to confront it head on.  And if <NAME/> is expressing any concerns about how things are going generally---which she expresses to me from time to time---I'd like to sit down with you and <NAME/> to discuss, if you think that would be useful.

Forgive the lengthy note, but having just gotten through the experience with <NAME/>, I'm not anxious to repeat, in any shape or form.

Talk to you at noon your time.

Best,
<NAME/>

<NAME/> To Repay Creditors 'Immediately,' But No Date Yet
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Embattled utility Southern California <NAME/> expects to pay all creditors "immediately," but the <NAME/> International (EIX) unit does not have a specific date of when its debt payments will begin, said <NAME/> <NAME/>, chairman and chief executive of <NAME/> International. 
"We intend to pay all of our creditors," <NAME/> said Wednesday in a call with reporters. "But we do not have a specific date." 
Southern California <NAME/> and the California Public Utilities Commission struck a deal Tuesday that will allow the utility to pay off $3.3 billion of its $3.9 billion debt through existing retail electricity rates. 
Both parties settled a year-old lawsuit Southern California <NAME/> filed against the PUC--otherwise known as a filed rate doctrine--that could have ended a retail rate freeze and allowed the utility to recover more than $5 billion in wholesale power costs from ratepayers. 
The settlement must still be approved by a federal court judge. A ruling is expected by Thursday. 
<NAME/> indicated that the utility may try to negotiate with some large generators, owed nearly $1 billion, to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for money the companies are owed. 
"There is no deal between us and the generators at this point," <NAME/> said. "We will engage promptly" in settlement discussions. "We are eager to work it out in a tough minded and fair way." 
<NAME/> Craver, <NAME/>'s chief financial officer, said the utility has between $2.4 and $2.5 billion cash-on-hand and about $3.9 billion in debt. 
<NAME/> said the utility does not expect its credit ratings to be restored to investment grade "immediately." 
"We've had some discussions with the credit rating agencies," <NAME/> said. "But no one expects it to be restored immediately. It's going to take some time." 
<NAME/> added that the utility will seek new lending opportunites, but he did not elaborate. 
     
<NAME/> <NAME/>, president of Southern California <NAME/>, said the utility would sit down with all of its creditors and work out a payment plan. 
<NAME/> said the utility believes that all of its debt can be paid off by the end of 2003. He did not say how much money from retail rates would be carved out for paying off Southern California <NAME/>'s debt. 
The utility's debt rose to $6.35 billion, according to a recent Securities and Exchange filing. 
"In the month of October we generated about $300 million" from retail rates. But <NAME/> said he could not estimate how much of that will be set aside to pay creditors. 
The utility and the PUC both said rates will not have to increase beyond the record rate hikes state regulators ordered earlier this year. 
<NAME/> said the utility has no intention of taking over the state's long-term power supply contracts as a result of the deal with the PUC. 
     
Fearing the state legislature wouldn't support a bill to rescue Southern Califoria <NAME/> after six months of wrangling, advisers to Gov. Gray <NAME/> and <NAME/> executives began negotiating with the state's Public Utilities Commission on a settlement of a year-old lawsuit the utility filed to force the commission to raise rates enough to cover its power costs. 
The negotiations with the PUC were kept secret from state lawmakers in case a settlement couldn't be reached, <NAME/> aides and <NAME/> executives said. 
The end result, <NAME/> and the commission said, is a deal that will allow the utility to work out a plan to pay off its creditors and keep Southern California <NAME/> from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy.

We are waiting for <NAME/> Greenberg to finalize the negotiations on the amendment to the online ETA for DB.  We would like to shut down BT from all financial trading.  However, what we found was that DB will not execute the online ETA without some revisions.  <NAME/> is negotiating an amendment to the ETA with DB.  Meanwhile, BT had already been trading online.  Since that cat was already out of the bag so to speak, DB didn't want to shut them down from trading without having another avenue to trade, so we are continuing to trade as BT.  We do not want to do this FOREVER, HOWEVER, so we do need to get BT SHUT DOWN.

HOW GOES IT MARK????

Hi Evie:
As you know <NAME/> is being, well, <NAME/> about just about everything at the PUC.  I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E, however.  I've helped to broker a meeting between large customers and PG&E (<NAME/> Botorff and <NAME/> <NAME/>) this Friday at 1:30 PM after DJ's meeting.  DJ and Delainey are organizing
 
The (basic) idea is to see if there is some way to strike a "reasonable" deal on the DA/cost allocation issues with PG&E, which could then be submitted to PUC around <NAME/>, which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible.
 
At the first meeting, we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 1) what matters to people 2) where people on the issues and 3) PG&E's willingness to deal.  The goal is to find out if there's any room for a deal.  Should not take a long time.
 
I hope you can attend, since the meeting will be significantly less productive if you're not there, and who knows, it may lead to something that permits us to go around <NAME/>.  Likely attendees are CMTA, CLECA, the Chamber, you (hopefully), PG&E and me.  <NAME/> <NAME/> Kahl be at DJ's meeting?
 
Best,
<NAME/>

Just want to check on the variable rate spreadsheet that you are working on.  Also, can you please change the Keystone page in the west packet to show total supply in the Permian basin with all delivery points to exporting pipelines (EPNG, Northern, Valero, TW).  Right now it just shows receipts into EPNG.

Please look at the attached spreadsheet.  It is a manual sheet that shows total EOL trades by trader.  Can we automate this sheet so that we can monitor by day?

Please respond when you get a chance.  Let me know if this is unclear.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

When I was 26 I was looking for an 18 year old girlfriend who looks exactly like <NAME/> Spears. Keep your eyes open. 2 Weeks till I am back in Calgary. I can't wait. Sold my car yesterday to a buddy of mine down here. I'm going to buy an Grand Cherokee Limited like my mom's. Black I think. What's new? I can't wait to get this move over and get settled in Calgary. I am really excited to move into my new place. It is going to be sweet. I think I can accomodate your request for a synthetic pillow. Are we going to be able to get some golf in before the snow comes? Talk to you soon.

I guess I think that it is not worth the fight these days.  I suppose would approve this training, but I think we need to have an understanding w/ Ogletree about travel time, travel expenses, billing rates, etc.  They need to understand who holds the purse strings, and I do not think it would be appropriate for them to bill their full hourly rate for time spent on travel given that we could find someone local to do the same training -- or could send me or Lizzette to do it for the cost of travel only.    For your information, <NAME/>, there is nothing magic about the training they are doing.  It is standard training that I used to deliver frequently when I was in private practice.  Ogletree does not have a monopoly on it.

I'll try to call you early this week, now that the other work I have been focusing on may slow down a bit.

A little barbaque, a little beer, a little boating, a little fishing, a little beer, a little golfing...I guess I should have taken the whole week off.

We can't wait for another meeting - we are in front of the OOC on Monday with the <NAME/> Americas plan.

Here's my numbers (I got them from etrade!!!!!):

0 - 5000 transactions per day		$  8:00/normal transaction (including internals)
> 5,000 transactions			$ 10:00/normal transaction 
Options					$ 10:00/ per option (using option grid)
Take or Pay				Minumum Number of transactions per annum = 1,000,000
Service Interruption (outage)		Reduction in our bill of $100,000		(less than 30 minutes)
					Reduction in our bill of $500,000		(greater then 30 minutes)
Per product type set up 			0		(its in your interest as the number of transactions is high in ENA.  It think this issue is for other groups.)
On development 			0		(its in your interest - I think this again an issue for other groups.)

Now we all have the same incentive - grow the number of trades. I think this is pretty close for us.  Only paying once for a sleeve trade.

Let the games begin!

<NAME/> Solmonson has made a personal choice to resign from <NAME/>.  It is with regret that I have accepted <NAME/>'s letter of recommendation.  <NAME/> has contributed greatly during her tenure at <NAME/>, particularly in the development of global information that has been critical in supporting our effective systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate <NAME/>'s personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in wishing <NAME/> well. 

Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within <NAME/> Net Works of the group led by <NAME/> <NAME/>.  <NAME/> will now report directly to <NAME/> Zipper, who leads <NAME/>Online.  The Operations Product Control Team in its early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to <NAME/>Online a smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges necessary between <NAME/>Online and our legacy systems.  The role of the team has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day  operations of <NAME/>Online.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have <NAME/>'s team as an integral part of the larger <NAME/>Online team.  <NAME/>'s team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.  <NAME/>, <NAME/> and I met with <NAME/>'s team yesterday to announce this organizational realignment.  <NAME/> has done a great job of leading the Product Control Group over the past 14 months.  <NAME/> is committed to see that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any changes in <NAME/>'s e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations are shared with us.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with <NAME/> and her team.

Thanks for your call a few weeks back.  Has been totally crazy here, with incredibly long hours over the last 6 to 8 weeks.  Today is my last day in the office until Monday, December 31.   I need the break!  Has been hard to squeeze in time to get ready for Christmas.  And we are hosting Tyler's 4th birthday party on Friday this week.  Christmas at home, as usual, and the <NAME/> and I will be off to New York the morning of December 26th with her friend <NAME/> and her mom.  We thought it would be a fun trip with our seniors!  Shopping, eating and seeing plays - will be back on the night of the 28th.  

Our upcoming trips are to <NAME/> for four days in early March with the high school drill team for nationals competition. Then spring break in mid-March in Telluride for our first family ski trip!  Hopefully we will all come back in one piece!

Have a wonderful Christmas and enjoy the sun in San <NAME/>.  Christmas cards are coming - you may just receive yours after Christmas.  Mo is in town and will join us for dinner tomorrow night. Grapevine has it that she is skinny as a rail!  

College update:  <NAME/> got her applications in to UT, OU, SMU and TCU before November 1.  She has acceptance letters from OU and SMU in hand, and is waiting to hear from UT and TCU.  I have no idea what her decision will be!  

Our best to <NAME/> and the girls.  --<NAME/>

The O & M/G & A graph needs to be done in two graphs.  One for direct costs and one for Corporate costs.  This way you can better see the increase in the Corp costs.

Yes, but I think we may lose that rating.  What is the impact if that were to occur?  Seems like we should (a) identify our situation given today's environment and (b) identify the impact of one further downgrade.

I talked with <NAME/> Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.  <NAME/> believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "protocol" into these discussions.  To clarify, according to <NAME/>, the "protocol" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, <NAME/> envisions simply e:mails or memos between <NAME/> and AEP with regard to any sharing of information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  Operational details to be decided between <NAME/> and AEP have been handled exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from <NAME/> Ball (<NAME/>) to <NAME/> <NAME/> (AEP).  

Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally documented.  <NAME/> Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with <NAME/>'s treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with <NAME/> Braband in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to that amendment and <NAME/> Koehler is sending it to <NAME/> Perkins in <NAME/>'s Treasury group for her review.  Upon <NAME/>'s review, <NAME/> will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  

We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require actions by <NAME/> will be our "to do" list.  Each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list or which appear in both the <NAME/> and AEP list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or memos as suggested by <NAME/> Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written "protocol".   We will also update you weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and AEP.  

I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches: 

	1)  <NAME/> and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that <NAME/> has a full 		understanding of operational transition items and their status, or 

	2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you.  

Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week.

I think I could make a case for decreasing ECP, because some of the uplift actually sneaks into the ECP (must run units for 6 hours etc.).   I would argue that the pool will dispatch more competitively when generators know that a peaker can run for 30 minutes at $100/Mwh.   This forces baseload units to offer very competitive pricing for all hours to ensure dispatch.

We have seen what the additional peakers in the East does to volatility and energy clearing prices, in general.

What are your thoughts?

I'm surprised that under the circumstances American won't just do it.  <NAME/> and I both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the airline (Continental for me and Virgin for <NAME/>).  Of course, in our cases the original flights were cancelled.  I don't have the Cunard reservations number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon.  I will get it for you when I get home.  The fax number for the guest relations department is (305)463-3030.

In a sense I felt safer in London than here.  Once we got off the QE2 we weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and I don't anticipate attacks against individual Americans overseas -- at least not outside of Muslim countries.  While there was an increase in police presence around town, we didn't hear of any actual threats to Americans while we were in London.  Airport security has been better there than here for a long time and now has been beefed up even further.  The Europeans just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do.  The sword rattling doesn't bother me too much.  I've been overseas during some tense international times before and as long as you're in a friendly country it shouldn't be an issue.  On the other hand, it REALLY feels good to be home and I can sure understand your wanting to have her with you.

From her point of view, I think that while the Brits were all being very sympathetic and supportive, the tragedy just isn't as immediate there and so the impact on <NAME/> has been somewhat less than if we had been home.  Given that, I think she doesn't want to waste this opportunity to do something fun in Europe while she has the chance and is already over there.  For me I have to say it was hard to have any fun after Tuesday noon, although I tried to put a good face on it.  I don't know when that will improve since I'm still pretty depressed.  It's probably even worse for you since you were so much closer to things than I am.  The lawyer in me sees two sides: (a) a trip to Paris is just the thing to take your mind off of events and (b) why waste a week of vacation and travel hassles when you aren't going to have a good time no matter where you go.

Feel free to give me a call if you want to chat.

Good luck!

The only way the coal deal will go forward is if you prove you can get long term supply (pet coke, PRB, other, etc.) for $1.00-1.15/MMBtu delivered to the site.   The economics need to show a 8-10% IRR in order to justify the commodity risk.

In addition, we should explore IGCC in Florida.   The gas/coal spread is much larger in this market and the proforma economics would be much better.

It's just one slide.  The 2nd bullet is true in the recent past, but not necessarily going forward.  I'd have to check with Jan tomorrow if the 4th bullet is in the ballpark.  Neither of these bullets represent a timeframe - <NAME/> said this is very high level.  I guess the last bullet kind of sums up our caveat.  Let me know if you have comments.  <NAME/> said she had been running this all past <NAME/>.

You are right.  There are no delivery/scheduling obligations on the day ahead DART product (unlike the regular day-ahead).  Yes.  A DART onpeak would mean delivery on all onpeak hours for the corresponding day, and a DART offpeak would mean delivery on all offpeak hours for the corresponding day.

Kimat,

For your records, here are my eol sim trades for the month of september through today.  I was out last week, but it appears that there was a trade around the 19th or 20th that i do not recall doing.  It looks like a buy of calendar 2003 of the Nymex for 5000 mmbtu per day.  I do not see this trade in my EOL transaction history.  Can you please look into this.  Thanks.

I've just reviewed this credit worksheet for a first draft ISDA.  Is this the type of counterparty for which a "regulatory out" MAC provision is appropriate?  I am not familiar with Exelon's business.  I know this event was used in some of Tracy's ISDA's with northwest utilities.

Hey Lee,

I was checking my msg for the claims adjuster and realized you left a msg , anytime you want to get a hold of me
just email me or stento me at 5952 , I never know when I have a msg on these phones

the market was weak this morning mainly due to power and then cash came in strong around 9:45 then that was followed by
short covering and stop losses , during this the front was strong and the back was weak and then the back picked up support
when the front got over 4.30 and the back pushed it up from there

All of this in front of aga

I talked to <NAME/> about the Texas opportunity and he seemed interested.  He still wanted to talk to <NAME/> <NAME/> about a potential cash trading role on the East desk.  In the same breath he said that he welcomed an opportunity that had some commercial aspects but did not require running a book (which the East desk job would probably require).  I believe he is hesitant to leave the East environment because he is so familiar with it.  He said he will let me know on Monday morning.

Raj,

Things are tough.  People are thinking tomorrow is the day for a lot of layoffs for non-core groups.  

40% chance we merge with Dynegy is what some people are saying.  Bankruptcy is our other option.

The working environment is not good. The firm needs to lay off people now, as opposed to dragging it out.     

I think the good groups will be sold off to the highest bidders, or competitors just buy up all our talented people when the company under.

Any news about your job offer?  Are you looking again?

Thanks for the reply.. 

Let's talk asap regarding this transportation. I can send you a summary sheet as to what we are looking to place. You had indicated that your a larger portion of your load is south. We have some 1,2 year service starting now, and we have the five year to PG&E.( we also have the baja).  

25th of month following on payables is normal protocol...that works fine!

I had assumed that for starting out, we would only work on sales to you on a Cash basis, or very short term( intra-month).

<NAME/> this helps a little bit re: RisktRAC.  After talking to <NAME/>, I believe the key to book codes is ensuring from IT that we can use whatever we want as the database will be entry.  <NAME/>, I agree that you should keep a power list and Kam should keep the gas list.  Also, just wondering if when we set up the gas books should we have also put in requests for gas daily, basis, index, etc.  I couldn't remember how that worked.

Rakesh,

I have informed Ryan Siurek (cc <NAME/> Buy) on Oct 4
that I cannot sign off on any analysis
done by our group without looking at full set of
legal documents related to the LJM
transactions. Those documents were not provided and therefore
we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past.

I have come to a conclusion that we cannot support
the valuations based on verbal and
often conflicting information, without doing  full due
diligence.

Feel free to provide the information to <NAME/> but,
please, inform her I cannot support the quantitative analysis
we have done in the past. I am especially concerned about the conflict between
the existence of the restriction and the existence of a put that are, in my view,
mutually exclusive.

Have updated spreadsheet for known data tonight.  

THESE THINGS NEED TO BE REVIEWED AND POSSIBLY CHANGED: 


Had Perlman's total numbers from today, which she did no subdivide into EA, EIM and EGM numbers.  Made assumption that numbers from Sunday's spreadsheet for <NAME/>'s EGM and EIM totals stood, and backed into EA numbers by simply taking her total minus Sunday's EGM and EIM numbers.  You will want to gut check this with <NAME/>. 

Had <NAME/>'s current total headcount (546) and her reductions to contractors and FTE's.  Didn't have detail on her contractor versus FTE numbers after reductions.  Just assumed 100 contractors, remaining FTE's.  You will need to get that detail from <NAME/> to correctly reflect her Revised Headcount.  

There was a bust in numbers that I had for Commodity Logic Development.  Gros gave me the starting number of 46 (contractors and FTE's - but without current breakdown).  His reductions were 6 contractors and 8 FTE's, which should have left a revised total headcount of 32.  But I wrote down a revised total headcount of 24 for this group.  Off by 8, so I increased the number of contractor cuts to 14 to make the math work.  Please go over details with <NAME/> and make corrections as needed.  

Didn't have confirmed starting total headcount for ISC.  Spreadsheet with his FTE names gives a count of 129, so I assumed that he has 50 contractors to come up to the spreadsheet starting number of 179.   <NAME/> only reduced by 3 FTE's and if he plans to reduce contractors I did not have that info.  So all other numbers for the ISC are simply forced.  Please review with <NAME/> and make corrections as needed.  

 
Have a nice Thanksgiving with your families.  You can reach my by cell phone tommorrow (mine: 713-417-1591 or <NAME/>'s:  713-299-1436) or at my parents' home starting about mid-afternoon (512-458-5510).

Sorry those didn't get to you yesterday.  It was 7:00 pm before I had time to get that together for you, only to discover that all that I had were hard copies.  Our ENW CAO had summarized the data for us into the single page format, and he had never e-mailed me the file.  He was gone for the day, and I tried his cell phone, but didn't get an anwer.  

Let me know how the meeting with <NAME/> and <NAME/> went today.  Lavorato and I have been working on something regarding gas logistics, and a follow up meeting was called on that this morning at 10:30.

We would be offered at 4.43 right now, but like all things.... what goes up must come down.   We moved down .16 in the front part of the curve, but the back has not followed as quickly.  I would expect we will have a good hedging opportunity the next couple of days, and then rally after that.

2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  <NAME/> will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  <NAME/> will also pay NewAlb $2.00/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity "NewAlb" that will return 9% assuming a book value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

*  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year for the next five.

ENA received a termination notice dated December 11, 2001 from Tribune of the 8/21/97 ISDA Master Agreement and all outstanding transactions.  The Early Termination Date is December 12, 2001.

The Tribune claims it owes no payment but is seeking return of $34,000,000 in "damages."

We need to identify all trades and identify the Settlement Amount for our response to them.  Are we holding any margin?

<NAME/>,  I didn't find any gas agreements in the binders that I have.  Most likely since it was done intra-ENA, there was no contract and it was simply booked under a deal ticket.  I will look to see if I can find any paper in our global database for the deal.

There are still about 2,000 deals between ECC and Riskmantra that need to be moved to the Bankruptcy books.  IT did all ECC to ENA deals, they need to change the script to ECC and Riskmantra.  We started to move some of the deals manually but there are too many to do.  Sanjeev Gupta has been doing this for us in the past.   I left a message with him but you might want someone to follow up with him to make sure it happens before calcing time today.

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down <NAME/>' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with <NAME/>' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
<NAME/>' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another <NAME/> appointee--<NAME/> Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve <NAME/>' proposed rate agreement.

What is <NAME/>' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject <NAME/>' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by <NAME/>, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed <NAME/>, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
All four PUC commissioners who voted against the <NAME/> rate agreement today urged <NAME/> to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get <NAME/> to sign it.
<NAME/> has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
Given today's vote, however, <NAME/> may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.

Update on <NAME/> Bailout
Still appears that chances are very small that <NAME/> and <NAME/> will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an <NAME/> bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.

If you have any questions, just let us know.

Best,

State's Electric <NAME/> Gets Lighter


Energy: <NAME/> and the PUC clash over why only a fraction of the 20% reduction will be passed on to consumers.

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO
Times Staff Writer

October 20 2001

SACRAMENTO -- California now expects its electricity bill to be 20% less than estimated as recently as two months ago, opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale, the <NAME/> administration said Friday. 

Even so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added. 

The discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray <NAME/> and Public Utilities Commission President <NAME/> Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won't see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation. 

Specifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state's power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans. 

Lynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state's energy contracts. 

California has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state's large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state's economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric, San <NAME/> Gas & Electric and Southern California <NAME/>, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers. 

In August, state officials estimated the department's power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion. 

But in what consumer groups angrily called a "jailbreak," <NAME/> administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state's power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state's power costs. 

Big Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to Consumers

The PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis. 

However, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system. Direct-access participation jumped from 2% to 13% of the overall power load being purchased by the California Department of Water Resources, according to the administration's latest numbers. 

"Unfortunately, all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers," said <NAME/> Garris, who oversees the department's power-buying division. "Put simply, the PUC's delay in suspending direct access means [the state's] costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller, retail customers." 

State Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides, who requested that the PUC suspend direct access earlier in the summer, blasted the commission Friday, saying the "stampede" of businesses would shift as much as $8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade, as they pay for the long-term contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity. 

"What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that's happened to consumers in this energy crisis," Angelides said. 

And consumer groups were even more critical, accusing the PUC of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis. 

"The PUC first gave <NAME/> their bailout," said <NAME/> Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, referring to the legal settlement recently approved by the commission to rescue the utility. "Now we find that big business is in effect getting bailed out of the energy crisis. These were the two groups, the big business guys and the utilities, that got us in this mess in the first place." 

But Lynch, the PUC president, said the number conflicted with the commission's figures, which showed direct access participation at roughly 8% of the overall load. That, she said, was similar to the number of businesses participating in direct access at the beginning of the year, a little more than 7%, before the energy crisis erupted. It fell to a low of 2% during the crisis because some energy companies realized they could make more money on the open market and breached their deals with state businesses, she said. 

Lynch accused Angelides and the <NAME/> administration of revisionist history, saying the commission postponed its decision at the administration's request. The commission then put off the decision again because the Legislature was considering its own solution to the problem, she said. 

The real problem, Lynch said, is that the state has too much electricity under contract at too high a price. If California had not purchased too much power, consumers would not have to pay for it, she said. 

"If people are leaving the system, those are fewer people [the state] needs to serve," Lynch said. "The problem, once again, is the long-term contracts. We need to renegotiate these contracts." 

Also adding to the state's financial burden is the fallout from a $4.3-billion energy loan the state took out this summer that it will not be able to repay in time, driving up the loan's interest rates. 

The loan was supposed to be repaid by the state's planned $12.5-billion energy bond sale to replenish the billions spent from the state budget on electricity this year. But the bond deal is now in limbo, in part because the PUC has refused to take action on a rate agreement that is required for the bond sale to move forward. As a result, a series of escalating interest rates spelled out in the loan deal are being triggered, which will soon force the Department of Water Resources to make payments to the bankers from its reserve. 

<NAME/> and Aides Stay Tight-Lipped on Strategy

In a related development, the newly created state public power authority, headed by S. <NAME/> <NAME/>, met Friday to consider approving millions of dollars worth of energy conservation and generation projects, but none were adopted because the authority learned it had no money to finance them. 

If the bond deal ever takes place, the state may be in a position to meet its financial obligations and possibly lower utility rates, which were raised this year in response to the energy crisis. The state may also have the option of floating a smaller bond, though advisors to the governor called that less likely. 

In another action that could reduce rates, <NAME/> administration officials confirmed Friday that they are planning to renegotiate some of the long-term power contracts, as The Times reported Thursday. The contracts have been criticized by consumer groups and some legislators for being inflexible and expensive. 

But <NAME/> advisors remained tight-lipped on the specifics, saying only that they have a strategy to convince power companies to open talks. 

"I don't think it's real smart to tell you that," said <NAME/> Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary.

My only addition would be to strengthen the answer to #5 - RTOs, even if formed, do not explicity resolve the question of the Native Load Exception.  I think that this is critical to highlight if this issued is raised.

No deal in energy refund talks
By <NAME/> Whitney

(Published July 10, 2001)
WASHINGTON -- Negotiations to settle a tangle of issues arising out of California's electricity debacle sputtered to an end Monday with the sides light-years apart on refunds for overpriced wholesale power sales.
The impasse raises the specter of years of litigation, with a regulatory judge proposing a formula that could limit refunds to about $1 billion while California is seeking at least $8.9 billion and perhaps much more.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge <NAME/> Wagner said that within a week he'll urge the five FERC commissioners to begin fact-finding hearings on how much is truly owed, following guidelines he outlined sketchily Monday.
Among them would be limiting the time when refunds are allowed -- something that could reduce state claims by about one-third -- and changing the way power plant costs are calculated to a formula more favored by generators.
Gov. Gray <NAME/> said he was heartened by the judge's belief that California is due some amount of refund money, rejecting the generators' arguments for no refunds.
With the 15-day negotiation session nearly moribund, generators and power traders had offered up $716 million in proposed refunds in the final days. But Wagner indicated that that would have to be offset by money the state still owes power companies, meaning no cash would actually change hands.
The judge held out the possibility that at least two parties, including San <NAME/>-based Calpine Corp., could reach separate agreements with the state.
"From what I know, it looks like we can reach an agreement," Calpine spokesman <NAME/> Highlander confirmed Monday. But he said he could not disclose any details under Wagner's gag order on participants in the negotiations.
<NAME/> Corp., one of the nation's highest-profile power traders, said California officials killed the talks by never budging from their claims that the state's consumers deserved at least $8.9 billion in refunds for overcharges.
"These talks never had a chance," said <NAME/> spokesman <NAME/> <NAME/>. "Their political skins are worth more than $716 million that the taxpayers of California could have used. It was about creating and maintaining a tool for a witch hunt."
Of the $716 million compromise offer, $510 million was put on the table by what Wagner called the "Big Five" generators -- Reliant, <NAME/>, Mirant, <NAME/> and Dynegy -- some of whom are under state investigation. Another $125 million was offered by BC Hydro, British Colombia's government utility, which is not under FERC jurisdiction, and $16.5 million was offered by six California municipal utilities.
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the state's second-largest municipal utility, also declined to comment on the talks or any settlement amount it may have offered, but said it would outline its position in writing Thursday, the judge's deadline for comments on his proposal.
Consumer advocates and some industry officials said the judge's brief public remarks make it difficult to predict exactly what the impacts could be on the state's troubled electric scene.
"If the judge is saying that the refund is topped at a billion that's outrageous," said <NAME/> Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network. "If they're going to start doing some fact finding, hallelujah."
Hoge said the talks had been unrealistic from the start, because there was no effort by FERC to determine how high the overcharges had actually been and then work toward a compromise from there.
The state used a formula calculated by its nonprofit grid operator, the Independent System Operator, which was attacked by marketers as wildly high even while the state called it conservatively low.
<NAME/> <NAME/>, representing all five of the big generators, said Monday that the ISO has consistently based its demand on "sketchy and incomplete" data.
The face-off between <NAME/> and power merchants began last fall, as wholesale electricity costs were soaring and California utilities warned that they could be driven into bankruptcy.
The governor said generators and traders took advantage of the state's power shortage to manipulate markets and gouge consumers. Generators said they followed all laws and were only deriving fair profits in a scarcity situation.
FERC, which entered the picture because by law it has to ensure that electricity rates are "just and reasonable," has made repeated, unsuccessful efforts to craft a solution that could appease both sides.
State Assembly Speaker <NAME/> Hertzberg, D-<NAME/> Oaks, said Monday that the failure of the settlement talks to agree on a refund figure "comes as no surprise."
Negotiators representing generators "refused to even acknowledge the inescapable fact that they have profited enormously by exploiting a dysfunctional market -- at California's expense," he said.
<NAME/>, who had accused the generators of failing to negotiate in good faith with state representatives, said that although FERC commissioners have been slow to respond to his requests for refunds and for price caps on wholesale electricity, they "now have the opportunity to redeem themselves."
He suggested the commissioners can opt to award California more than is recommended by the judge.
Wagner, after mediating talks that continued throughout the weekend, seemed resigned to the fact that trying to bring more than 50 government, utility and power generating entities together proved to be an exercise in futility.
<NAME/> Kahn, head of the California delegation and consultant to the California ISO, nonetheless came away thinking the state had fared pretty well.
"We came here wanting $8.9 billion," Kahn said. "In all candor, we didn't receive any meaningful settlement offers and so the negotiations were not as helpful as we had hoped they would be. But our positions were vindicated" because refunds were offered.
Meanwhile, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California <NAME/> sounded the call for more talks.
"We're willing to talk to anyone, anytime about a settlement," said <NAME/> Pickett, general counsel of Southern California <NAME/>. PG&E said in a prepared statement that the sessions "provide a solid basis for further negotiations."
How much money the state might eventually receive remains the big question mark. Wagner said settlement offers of $716 million suggest that eventual refunds will amount to "hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe a billion." But he also stressed that he would recommend no specific figure to FERC commissioners and does not know how big refunds might eventually be.
Other recommendations Wagner said he would make to the commission were a mixed bag for the state.
The judge said he would recommend refunds no further back than Oct. 2, 2000, an action that Kahn said would immediately slice $3 billion off the state's refund analysis that stretched back to May 2000.
But Kahn said that was no defeat for the state, which would turn to the courts to recover that and any other sums excluded from a final refund order.
"We still have a viable litigation claim for the remainder," Kahn said.
<NAME/> Bailey, vice president and general counsel of <NAME/> Energy of North America, said he felt the formula laid out by Wagner would generate a refund order in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
"It's a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks," Bailey said.

Third power plant opens: But the Los Medanos facility isn't pouring out electricity yet.
By <NAME/> Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 10, 2001)
The flood of new electricity being welcomed by Gov. Gray <NAME/> was only a trickle at the latest power plant that the governor opened on Monday, according to sources close to California's energy crisis.
Heralded by <NAME/> as part of a "powerful one-two-three punch" that will bring California closer to energy independence, the Los Medanos Energy Center in Pittsburg spit out no more than 20 megawatts on its opening day, they said.
That is less than 5 percent of the plant's 555-megawatt operating capacity.
Los Medanos could generate a couple of hundred megawatts later this week but is not expected to reach its full output for two to three weeks, according to knowledgable sources.
Representatives for Calpine and the governor's office, when pressed for details, acknowledged that the plant was not running at full tilt but said they did not know how much electricity was actually produced Monday.
Calpine, which will bill someone for whatever electricity it sells from Los Medanos, is keeping track of the production but the figure wasn't immediately available for the media, spokeswoman <NAME/> Potter said.
"Even if it was two megawatts, that's two more megawatts that we didn't have yesterday," said <NAME/> spokesman <NAME/> Maviglio.
He said the opening was "largely ceremonial," timed for the convenience of the governor and Calpine's top executive.
But consumer advocate <NAME/> Rosenfield called the media event "a deception." It was the third highly publicized power plant launch the governor has attended in the past two weeks.
"It's the governor trying to convince people he's hard at work solving the problem when it's all for show," Rosenfield said. "He's governing by sound bite. He's certainly getting his money's worth from the consultants he hired."
<NAME/> political adviser <NAME/> South said last week that the governor's new radio ad campaign will highlight the efforts to produce more power in California.
"Generation comes up in our polls as being the No. 1 thing people want us to do -- build more power plants," South said then. "People want the sense that progress is being made -- that this is not spiraling out of control."
The other two plants that <NAME/> kicked off -- Sunrise in Kern County and Sutter near Yuba City -- have since been running at maximum capacity.
Calpine anticipates pumping the full 550 megawatts out of Los Medanos within a week to 10 days, company officials said.
"In the first month of these new plants, there are always stops and starts," said Calpine spokesman <NAME/> Highlander. "Sometimes we shut down altogether."
Including the three just-opened facilities, new or expanded power plants are expected to add 1,500 megawatts to the state's struggling electric grid by the end of July, and 870 megawatts of that is already in place, according to the state Independent System Operator.
Another 1,000 megawatts is anticipated for the end of August and 1,100 more for the end of September, under a rough timetable that is likely to see some plants zip ahead of schedule and others fall behind.

State reveals high-priced power deals
By Dale Kasler and <NAME/> Bowman
Bee Staff Writers
(Published July 10, 2001)
The state Monday released details of its adventures in buying electricity on the spot market, revealing a chaotic world in which prices fluctuate wildly within minutes.
The Department of Water Resources, which has been criticized for keeping its power-purchasing practices a secret, released 1,770 pages of invoices and trade confirmations that provided the most detailed look yet of its purchases since it jumped into the energy-buying business Jan. 17. The information was released a week after state Controller <NAME/> Connell put out details of the state's long-term power contracts over the objections of Gov. Gray <NAME/>, her political nemesis.
The state has committed about $8.1 billion to buying power on behalf of California's crippled utilities, straining the budget surplus and raising questions from lawmakers and others about <NAME/>' policies for resolving the state's energy crisis. In turn, state officials have accused many suppliers of gouging California to the tune of several billion dollars.
When it came to the spot market, the water department was at the mercy of a business run amok. The state paid upward of $300 a megawatt-hour for days in January and February -- months when electricity normally should be a lot cheaper. Water officials said prices have dropped to the $100 range largely because they've signed a slew of long-term contracts, reducing their dependence on spot sales.
"Our exposure earlier this year to the spot market was at the maximum," said <NAME/> Hidalgo, spokesman for the water department.
The information released Monday covered the first three months of the year and didn't include the highest price the water department has paid for electricity: $1,900 a megawatt-hour in May to Reliant Energy Inc., a Texas generator that owns several plants in the state. <NAME/> Energy Corp. of North <NAME/> charged even more for power in January, $3,880 a megawatt hour, but that sale was made to the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's transmission grid.
The documents show that while the state's stricken utilities no longer buy power for themselves, their sister companies have sold expensive power.
Through May 31, the state paid a trading arm of Sempra Energy, the parent of San <NAME/> Gas & Electric, some $429 million for power. It paid PG&E Energy Trading, an unregulated sister company of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., about $23.7 million.
Among others, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was paid $331 million through May 31; Canadian utility BC Hydro was paid $1.05 billion; Atlanta's Mirant Corp. $1.24 billion; the federal government's Bonne=07ville Power Administration $167 million; and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District $80.7 million.
Generally, the more desperate the state was for power, the higher the prices. For instance, Oklahoma-based generator <NAME/> Cos. commanded $565 a megawatt-hour March 20, when blackouts struck more than 1 million Californians.
Location also was critical. On March 8 the state paid the PG&E trading unit $250 but only $180 to Arizona-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. The difference was that PG&E's power was delivered to energy-starved Northern California, while Pinnacle's was sent to Southern California where energy wasn't so scarce.
Split-second timing was also crucial. At 9:09 a.m. Feb. 14, the state paid $400 to Mirant for power to be delivered the next day. By 10 a.m. it was paying Mieco Inc., a Long Beach trading firm, $475 for the same product.
"That's the spot market -- it's the most volatile market in the world, and it changes on a second-by-second basis," said <NAME/> Corp. spokesman <NAME/> <NAME/>.
For all the criticism leveled at <NAME/>, Reliant and other big corporations, government-owned entities were among the most aggressive at charging high prices.
BC Hydro, the electric utility owned by the Canadian province of British Columbia, submitted bills for up to $1,000 a megawatt-hour. The city of Glendale charged $375 a megawatt-hour for power in January, while SMUD charged $309 a megawatt-hour in March. The city of <NAME/>, Ore., averaged $450 a megawatt-hour in February.
"We play by the rules of the electricity trade marketplace," said BC Hydro spokesman <NAME/> Cousins. "Our traders worked very hard to find additional sources of electricity to keep the lights on in California. Had we not come through and stepped forward with these supplies, the consequences to California customers would have been severe."
The state also said it has spent $14.4 million on administrative costs in buying power.

Government finds ways to conserve: The Santa <NAME/> Jail goes solar as agencies get creative to cut costs.
By <NAME/> Miller
Bee Correspondent
(Published July 10, 2001)
To <NAME/> Muniz, the solar panels sprouting on the rooftop of the Santa <NAME/> Jail in Dublin aren't just energy-makers; they're money in the bank.
When all 4,000 panels are completely installed this month, the 500-kilowatt photovoltaic system -- the largest rooftop project ever constructed in the United States -- will cut the jail's demand on the electric grid by up to 20 percent, according to Muniz, Alameda County's energy program manager.
That sun power, combined with conservation projects already completed at the jail, will slash about $300,000 a year from the facility's energy bill. Muniz is already scouting other county rooftops for solar potential.
"With the cost of electricity going up, you can start looking at it as a business decision, just investing your money," said Muniz. "There's virtually no maintenance on this equipment. It just sits on your roof and converts right into electricity that you're using as soon as you generate it. I think (solar) is the wave of the future, even though it's been around 30 or 40 years."
The Santa <NAME/> Jail project is among the largest, and perhaps most conspicuous, examples of steps government agencies are taking to cut electricity use in response to skyrocketing power bills and Gov. Gray <NAME/>' call for public entities to conserve.
Among the examples:
San <NAME/> leaders are pondering a bond measure to finance solar-powered rooftop projects around the city.
The Tulare County town of Lindsay will open City Hall two hours earlier -- at 6 a.m.-- and close at 4:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday this summer so offices can stay dark all day Friday and during peak-use afternoon hours.
Sacramento County has instituted a casual dress policy so employees can better withstand office temperatures that climb as high as 78 degrees. Workers have also set sprinklers to run at night so that electric water pumps operate during low demand.
"When you start to see the bills going up and you start to hear concerns from some citizens, that obviously raises the threshold of wanting to help out," said Jolena Voorhis, an energy analyst at the California State Association of Counties. "Certainly (counties) stepped up to the plate when they were asked to increase conservation efforts. They've done about as much as humanly possible."
Kings County leaders thought they made a great deal in 1992 when they signed up for Southern California <NAME/>'s interruptible load program, which promises customers lower rates in exchange for agreeing to shut down electrical services in times of shortage.
Then California's power crisis hit full-force this year. Since January, <NAME/> has called on the Central Valley county to cut electricity at its Hanford government center 16 times -- for up to six hours each cycle.
At times that meant no lights to greet the public, no computers to process food stamp requests and during the Valley's foggy winter days, no heat to warm many of the 1,200 employees.
"We had one week in January when we were virtually shut down," said Chief Administrative Officer <NAME/> Spikes. "We just decided we couldn't function that way."
So Kings County supervisors bought a $550,000 diesel-powered generator to match those already at the jail and juvenile center. They also decided to open and close administrative offices one hour earlier this summer so buildings can power down before high demand hits the grid around 4 p.m.
The new hours, dimmed hallways and moments of darkness that occur when the generators kick on have become a routine part of doing government business these days, Spikes said.
So far, most counties have been able to absorb higher energy costs without cutting into programs because of relatively healthy budgets in recent years, Voorhis said.
Public agencies' power troubles have proved a boon to some businesses.
Revenues at PowerLight, the Berkeley company that installed the Santa <NAME/> Jail photovoltaic system, have tripled since last year.
"The last six months have been particularly intense," said <NAME/> Lin, director of business development for PowerLight. "In some ways the energy crisis in California has been a call to action."
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, which already boasts the largest photovoltaic program in the country, has a 2,000-customer waiting list for solar projects and plans to bring sun power to the state Capitol, said <NAME/> Osborn, SMUD's solar program manager.
Back in Dublin, the 3,600 inmates at the Santa <NAME/> Jail still receive three meals, air conditioning and hot showers -- powered now, in part, by the plentiful sun in this relatively fog-free part of the East Bay.
The $4 million project, financed entirely with state and utility subsidies, should generate enough savings to pay for itself within the decade, Muniz said.
"It's a good investment for the money we're putting up front," he said.






   Energy talks reach no settlement; state threatens suit        By <NAME/> <NAME/> ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 10, 2001  WASHINGTON - With talks between the state and power generators stalled, California may go to court to help win the $8.9 billion state officials believe it was overcharged for electricity.  "I think we have demonstrated very clearly both to the FERC and to the judge that the state is owed $8.9 billion and will settle for nothing less," said <NAME/> Salazar, a spokesman for Gov. Gray <NAME/>.  With negotiations at an impasse, the administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said California is probably owed no more than $1 billion in refunds.    "The numbers were too far apart," said <NAME/> Wagner, the FERC chief administrative law judge.  California, Wagner said, may receive nothing at all, because generators may be owed more than they have to return for any overcharges.  He placed the refunds owed the state at between $716 million and $1 billion. Power providers had offered $716 million as part of an overall settlement, while California state officials sought $8.9 billion, Wagner said.  He said California officials had not made the case for $8.9 billion in refunds.  Salazar, however, said the state would go to court and may ask for $20 billion.  Separately, Wagner split off claims of overcharges from the Pacific Northwest, saying he has not had time to consider those allegations under the short timetable ordered by FERC last month.  Wagner served as a mediator during the 15 days of negotiations and will recommend a settlement to FERC by next Monday. The commission ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences between producers and the state over the breakdown of California's deregulated electricity market.  Consumer advocates assailed the judge's recommendation and urged the state to continue its attempt to get refunds from what they say are profiteering power companies.  "It's like catching a bank robber, but instead of making him give back all of it, you only make him give back 5 percent of what he stole," said <NAME/> Heller, spokesman for the Santa <NAME/>-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.  Power generators, however, were generally pleased with Wagner's comments.  <NAME/> Bailey, general counsel for <NAME/> Energy, said even if the formula Wagner recommends produces $1.5 billion in refunds, "that's a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks."  California officials, negotiating on behalf of utilities, the Public Utilities Commission and state power buyers, accused the producers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices.  The producers have acknowledged prices are high, but blame jumps in the price of natural gas, which fuels many power plants, and the workings of the free market.  The bill for wholesale power in California soared to $27 billion last year from $7 billion the year before. <NAME/> has estimated the state could spend as much as $50 billion this year.  The producers reiterated Monday that California's numbers are grossly inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators - <NAME/> Energy, Dynegy, Mirant, Reliant Energy and the <NAME/> Cos. - said in a statement that they have made a "very substantial global settlement offer."  Reliant would agree to no more than $50 million in refunds as part of an overall settlement that also would have to include protection from additional legal claims, said <NAME/> H. Stout, a company senior vice president.  But Stout also said, "Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains that no refunds are justified."              Refunds in jeopardy as talks fail        Judge sees possibility of offsets equal to the billions sought by state By Toby Eckert  COPLEY NEWS SERVICE  July 10, 2001  WASHINGTON -- Settlement talks between California and power providers accused of electricity price gouging collapsed yesterday, and the judge who will now hand the case over to federal regulators set a course far from favorable to the state's demand for $8.9 billion in refunds.  "There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars," <NAME/> L. Wagner Jr., chief administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said in previewing the recommendations he will make to the commission.  But Wagner, who mediated the talks, also suggested that power sellers are still owed sums for electricity "that probably are higher than any overcharges" for which they may have to pay refunds.  That opened the possibility that California could see no cash refunds, only a reduction in the billions of dollars the power generators and marketers claim they are owed by state entities and utilities.  Wagner said he would recommend that FERC hold a "fast-track hearing" to try to untangle the complex financial claims and counterclaims arising from California's power crisis.  Wagner also outlined a method that he said FERC should use for calculating refunds.  While his proposed formula includes part of one method the state used, it contains several elements for calculating electricity costs that were favored by power sellers, who maintain that California's numbers are wildly exaggerated.  "I would suspect that would result in a number much below $8.9 billion," said Joe Ronan, vice president of Calpine, a San <NAME/>-based electricity generator. "I think (Wagner's method) reflects more accurately what actually happened" in the state's dysfunctional power market.  But <NAME/> Kahn, the state's lead negotiator, said Wagner "vindicated" California's core arguments.  "The hundreds of people who came here on the other side had argued to the mediator that there should not be any refunds, and that position was loudly rejected," said Kahn, chairman of the organization that manages most of California's power grid.  "We think the numbers, even using the judge's formula, are going to be in the multiple billions. Whatever amount of money . . . is awarded to us, we will have viable claims in state court and other jurisdictions for the remainder. So what we have here is a situation where California will get its $8.9 billion."  Power sellers acknowledged that the threat of litigation remains worrisome to them. They sought an end to investigations of their conduct, and immunity from legal action as part of their bargaining position.  During two weeks of negotiations ordered by FERC, the two sides came nowhere near bridging their differences. Wagner said a number of power sellers had put forward offers that totaled $716.1 million.  "That's a long way from splitting the difference," he said. "In 15 days, you can't work miracles."  Yesterday -- the deadline for completing the talks -- the ill will between the two sides broke into the open as Wagner allowed reporters into the previously closed hearings.  Each side essentially accused the other of bargaining in bad faith and failing to put forward realistic proposals.  <NAME/> H. Stout, a senior vice president at Reliant Energy Wholesale Group, said the state used "biased calculations" to arrive at its $8.9 billion refund demand. He also said that Reliant offered to knock $50 million off the $300 million it claims it is still owed for power sold into the state.  Kahn shot back that Reliant made the offer confidentially to Wagner and never approached the state.  Figures scrutinized "This is the first time we've heard any of this information. And to give the impression that somehow there's been cooperation or forthcomingness, I think is misleading," Kahn said.  The state's refund calculations were scrutinized repeatedly during the talks.  The $8.9 billion figure emerged from a study by the California power grid operator of charges for electricity between May 2000 and May 2001, a period when wholesale power prices soared.  Kahn said the figure was essentially duplicated when the state went back and calculated what power costs would have been if a pricing method instituted by FERC last month had been in effect for the entire yearlong period.  FERC ordered the pricing method in a bid to tame wholesale prices in the West.  In a partial win for the state, Wagner said he would recommend that FERC use the order retroactively as a basis for calculating refunds, an approach resisted by the power sellers.  But he said that FERC should only scrutinize charges going back to October 2000, and should make several key changes in how power-generating costs are calculated.  For instance, he said, FERC should determine the actual amount of gas heat it takes to generate a megawatt of electricity and use spot market prices in Northern and Southern California to determine the cost of gas, rather than a statewide average cost, computed monthly.  Fewer overcharges? Those and other parts of the complex formula Wagner will recommend could increase the benchmark cost of producing power and drive down the amount of overcharges.  Kahn said that applying FERC's pricing method only back to October would put about $3 billion of the state's refund claim off-limits.  <NAME/> Bailey, vice president and general counsel for <NAME/> Energy North America, said, "We think (Wagner's) modifications are certainly a vast improvement over FERC's June 19 order and also certainly over (the state's) model."  America.  In Sacramento, Gov. Gray <NAME/> issued a statement characterizing the electricity suppliers as pirates who refused to negotiate in good faith.  "While in the past the FERC has shown little, if any, interest in consumers, they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 billion California has demonstrated it is owed," <NAME/> said.  Despite the harsh rhetoric, both sides indicated that they would continue trying to reach one-on-one settlements.  Ronan of Calpine said the generator was close to making a deal with the state. Bailey said that while <NAME/> would continue to push for a "global settlement" between all the parties, "We've had serious settlement talks with the state over the last few days and hope to continue."               State's massive outlays detailed        Energy bill exceeded $100 million on 3 days By <NAME/> <NAME/>  ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 10, 2001  SACRAMENTO -- On three days in May, California's daily power spending topped $100 million, according to a report released yesterday by state power traders.  The California Department of Water Resources report, which addressed spot market electricity purchases since January, was released along with 1,770 pages of documents that specifically detailed the first three months of last-minute power purchases.  Such power buys on the spot market typically get the most expensive electricity available.  The report details the department's electricity spending since Jan. 17, when the state took over electricity purchases for Pacific Gas and Electric Co., San <NAME/> Gas & Electric Co., and Southern California <NAME/>.  The utilities had amassed billions in debts and were no longer creditworthy enough to purchase power. Since then, the state has spent nearly $8 billion to keep the lights on.  The state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million. The second-highest daily total was May 23, when the state spent $101.8 million. The day before, the state spent $100 million.  But since May, spot market prices have dropped, due in part to moderate weather, lower natural gas prices, increased conservation which lowered demand and because of increased scrutiny by lawmakers and investigators into possible price manipulation. Gov. Gray <NAME/> has said long-term contracts also drove the price down.  "It does look like some of the spot market prices have gone down, but it looks like it's primarily due to natural gas prices," said Jamie Fisfis, spokesman for Assembly Republicans.  The slight reduction in spot market prices "underscores questions about the strategy of locking us into long-term contracts, if natural gas prices continue to drop," Fisfis said.  Most of the long-term contracts run for 10 years, with one lasting for 20 years.  "It's unfortunate that it looks like we'll never get out from under these contracts," Fisfis said.  <NAME/> has already released details of the state's long-term power contracts after losing a court battle with Republican legislators and several news organizations, including The Associated Press and The Copley Press, which publishes The San <NAME/> Union-Tribune.  <NAME/> released copies of those contracts, but wanted to delay the release of the spot market buys and short-term contracts. Releasing those details too soon after the purchases would reveal the state's buying strategy and could cause generators to raise their already sky-high prices, <NAME/> said.  The number of spot market buys will lessen, the <NAME/> administration says, as more long-term contracts are signed, reducing the state's exposure to the high-priced purchases.  The governor's office will release future short-term contracts and spot market buys will be released on a quarterly basis, with a 90-day lag time. Second quarter information will be released in October and third quarter documents will be available in January.  <NAME/> maintains the delay is needed to protect its ability to negotiate further spot-market power buys.  According to the water department, Canadian Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro, has been paid $1.05 billion for spot market purchases as of May 31.  But Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. topped that list, getting $1.24 billion as of the end of May.  The newly released short-term contracts also show what the state had to pay when it needed power the most.  On March 19 and 20, when rolling blackouts hit California again, the state was forced into paying above-average prices in its largest short-term contracts.  For example, Mirant sold the state 650 megawatts an hour at off-peak usage times on March 20 for $345 a megawatt hour, more than $70 above the average price of $272.96.  The day before, Mirant charged $343 a megawatt hour at off-peak in northern California when the average cost was $254.52.  Also on March 19, Mirant charged the state about $96 above the average price for power in Northern California on a sale of 6,400 megawatt hours during off-peak times.  Other top-selling generators, as of May 31:   Sempra Cos., $429 million.   Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, $331 million.   Dynegy, $296 million.   TransAlta Energy, $202 million.   Bonneville Power, $168 million.   <NAME/> Energy, $164 million.         State releases early spot market energy purchases        By <NAME/> <NAME/> ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 10, 2001  SACRAMENTO - On three days in May, California's daily power allowance topped $100 million, according to a report released Monday by state power traders.  However, the source of those high prices was from not solely from Texas, home to many of the power marketers and wholesalers Gov. Gray <NAME/> has blamed for much of California's power woes.  Public and private power companies such as Canada's B.C. Hydro, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Sacramento's public utility also were high on the list.  The California Department of Water Resources released the report, along with 1,770 pages of documents that also detailed the last-minute power purchases the state made on the spot market in the first three months of the year.  Last-minute power buys on the spot market typically get the most expensive electricity available.  The report details the department's electricity spending since Jan. 17, when the state took over electricity purchases for Pacific Gas & Electric Co., San <NAME/> Gas & Electric Co., and Southern California <NAME/>.  The utilities had amassed billions in debts and were no longer creditworthy enough to purchase power. Since then, the state has spent nearly $8 billion to keep the lights on.  The state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million. The second-highest daily total was May 23, when the state spent $101.8 million. The day before, the state spent $100 million.  But since May, spot market prices have dropped, due in part to moderate weather, lower natural gas prices, increased conservation which lowered demand and because of increased scrutiny by lawmakers and investigators into possible price manipulation. Gov. Gray <NAME/> has said long-term contracts also drove the price down.  "It does look like some of the spot market prices have gone down, but it looks like it's primarily due to natural gas prices," said Jamie Fisfis, spokesman for Assembly Republicans.  The slight reduction in spot market prices "underscores questions about the strategy of locking us into long-term contracts, if natural gas prices continue to drop," Fisfis said.  Most of the long-term contracts run for 10 years, with one lasting for 20 years.  "It's unfortunate that it looks like we'll never get out from under these contracts," Fisfis said.  <NAME/> has already released details of the state's long-term power contracts after losing a court battle with Republican legislators and several news organizations, including The Associated Press, who said keeping the contracts veiled violated the state's open records law.  <NAME/> released copies of those contracts, but wanted to delay the release of the spot market buys and short-term contracts. Releasing those details too soon after the purchases would reveal the state's buying strategy and could cause generators to raise their already sky-high prices, <NAME/> said.  The number of spot market buys will lessen, the <NAME/> administration says, as more long-term contracts are signed, reducing the state's exposure to the high-priced purchases.  The governor's office will release future short-term contracts and spot market buys will be released on a quarterly basis, with a 90-day lag time. Second quarter information will be released in October and third quarter documents will be available in January.  <NAME/> maintains DWR needs the delay to protect its ability to negotiate further spot-market power buys.  According to the DWR, Canadian Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro, has been paid $1.05 billion for spot market purchases as of May 31.  But Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. topped that list, getting $1.24 billion as of the end of May.  The newly released short-term contracts also show what the state had to pay when it needed power the most.  On March 19 and 20, when rolling blackouts hit California again, the state was forced into paying above-average prices in its largest short-term contracts.  For example, Mirant sold the state 650 megawatts an hour at off-peak usage times on March 20 for $345 a megawatt hour, more than $70 above the average price of $272.96. The day before, Mirant charged $343 a megawatt hour at off-peak in northern California when the average cost was $254.52.  Also on March 19, Mirant charged the state about $96 above the average price for power in Northern California on a sale of 6,400 megawatt hours during off-peak times.  Other top selling generators, as of May 31:  - Sempra Companies, $429 million.  - Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, $331 million.  - Dynegy, $296 million.  - TransAlta Energy, $202 million.  - Bonneville Power, $168 million.  - <NAME/> Energy, $164 million.           FERC Judge Says State Owed No More Than $1 Billion From Associated Press  July 9 2001  WASHINGTON -- California is owed no more than "a billion dollars" from power wholesalers, a federal regulatory judge said today at the end of 15 days of settlement talks in the state's electricity crisis.  <NAME/> Wagner, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's chief administrative law judge, said that at the same time the power suppliers probably are owed more than that.  The net effect of his preliminary recommendation is that California probably will receive no refunds from wholesalers.  Wagner said power generators had offered $761 million in refunds. The state has asked for $8.9 billion since May 2000. Wagner said he will not recommend refunds for power sales that occurred before Oct. 2.  It was not immediately clear what impact the judge's preliminary recommendation would have on efforts to settle the dispute.  Both sides said before the judge's announcement that they expected a protracted legal battle in the event the talks did not produce a settlement.  <NAME/> Kahn, Gov. Gray <NAME/>'s representative in the talks, has said the state would seek more than twice the claimed overcharges if the dispute moved from mediated talks to a courtroom.  The producers reiterated today that California's numbers are grossly inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators-- <NAME/> Energy, Dynegy, Mirant, Reliant Energy and the <NAME/> Cos.-- said in a statement that they have made a "very substantial global settlement offer."  <NAME/> H. Stout, a senior vice president for Reliant Energy, said his company would agree to no more than $50 million in refunds, as part of an overall settlement that also would have to include protection from additional legal claims.  But Stout also said, "Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains that no refunds are justified."  FERC ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences between producers and the state over the breakdown of California's deregulated electricity market.  The state has accused the producers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices. The producers have acknowledged that prices are high, but blame jumps in the price of natural gas, which fuels many power plants, and the workings of the free market.  The bill for wholesale power in California soared to $27 billion last year from $7 billion the year before. <NAME/> has estimated that the state could spend as much as $50 billion this year.  ----  On the Net:  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission: http://www.ferc.fed.us/   Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times       Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more than the firms that <NAME/> has pilloried, records show. RICH CONNELL and ROBERT J. LOPEZ and DOUG SMITHS TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 10 2001  SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray <NAME/>, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show.  During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.  Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San <NAME/> Gas & Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP. In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by <NAME/> and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., <NAME/> Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents.  The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies.  <NAME/> spokesman <NAME/> Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period.  "You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said.  "The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from <NAME/>, Tulsa, Atlanta or <NAME/>."  The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first quarter.  The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators.  <NAME/> Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. "All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January.  The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show.  In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies. For example, <NAME/>-based <NAME/>, one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.  By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.  A spokesman for <NAME/>, <NAME/> <NAME/>, said recently that the "vilification of <NAME/> was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.  A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San <NAME/> Gas & Electric, said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high.  More Power Bought Than Projected  Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market.  Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more than <NAME/>' analysts had projected.  Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July.  The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under $100 a megawatt-hour.  A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited <NAME/>' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term power contracts with with "moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy."  Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times       <NAME/> Energy Asked to Allow Release of Data Power: Senator says the generator is refusing to make public some information crucial to the price-gouging probe. Firm says it's complying. CARL INGRAM TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 10 2001  SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing suspected price gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday that <NAME/> Energy is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigation.  Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa <NAME/>) said <NAME/> has made the price bidding information from its Chula Vista plant available to committee members and staffers. But under a federal confidentiality rule, the data cannot be made public without <NAME/>'s consent.  The documents concern the Chula Vista plant, which former employees have alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days in January. However, state records show that the agency overseeing the electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing throughout the state. Dunn said <NAME/>'s refusal thwarts the committee's investigation and efforts to enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential information cannot be shared with others in the Legislature or the public.  Dunn said <NAME/> cited a rule of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and which stay secret.  "The only one who can release the data is <NAME/>. We agreed to be bound by what is provided in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less," he said.  Former Employees Tell of Maneuvers  Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the information elsewhere and "release it over <NAME/>'s objections."  Three former workers at the <NAME/> plant near Chula Vista testified last month under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in what seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergency.  But <NAME/> countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricity grid in balance. <NAME/> later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its explanation.  <NAME/> executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full picture of the plant's operation during the three days.  But Dunn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging, said Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data, <NAME/> was guilty of the same tactics.  "<NAME/> is trying to draw the impression that it has [provided] the full picture. But they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions until all that data has been released. That hasn't occurred," Dunn said.  To make a determination whether the Chula Vista power was withheld to drive up prices, Dunn said, the committee must publicly examine "the bids <NAME/> submitted from which the ISO issued orders to the plant." They include the expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, he said.  <NAME/>, a North <NAME/>-based wholesaler that operates several plants in California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and off-limits to legislators not on the committee.  <NAME/> spokesman <NAME/> <NAME/> insisted that the generator is attempting to comply with the committee's demands. But he was unable to say whether <NAME/> would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records the committee plans to turn over.  "We are complying now," <NAME/> said. "There is some suggestion that we are leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I don't know what we are ultimately going to do."  The committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they provide pricing and bidding documents by Wednesday. Six, including <NAME/>, have said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation. Two, <NAME/> and Mirant, were cited.  Dunn said the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are trying to comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formally charged with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is the final arbiter of such issues.  Although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing severe fines. In 1929, the most recent case, a cement company executive was sent to jail.  Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times        NEWS ANALYSIS Concern Over Price of Long-Term Power Pacts Grows Embedded costs may yield more rate hikes, critics say, and the $43-billion total could complicate plans to rescue <NAME/>. DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 9 2001  SACRAMENTO -- Even as the summer progresses without blackouts, and Gov. Gray <NAME/> prepares for yet another news conference today to symbolically switch on a new power plant, the work in the Capitol has shifted to the seemingly more daunting task of balancing the books.  It's a task with potentially far more long-lasting implications for state coffers, for businesses' bottom lines and for consumers' wallets.  In particular, long-term power contracts trumpeted by the governor's office as helping to bring stability to California's out-of-control electricity market are having the opposite effect politically. A growing concern about the $43-billion price tag of the contracts is complicating one of <NAME/>' most ambitious energy initiatives: a proposed financial rescue of Southern California <NAME/>, which already faces an uncertain fate in the Legislature. Questions about the contracts come as California readies a complex $13.4-billion bond sale to reimburse the state's general fund for other power purchases.  Critics worry that costs embedded in the contracts, on top of the billions needed to pay for the <NAME/> rescue, could lead to additional electricity rate hikes for consumers. Key lawmakers, consumer advocates and business lobbyists are urging that at least some of the pacts be renegotiated.  Citing a recent plunge in wholesale energy costs, these critics say the state should work to shorten the duration of the contracts and lower some of the prices. They argue that the state entered into the deals under duress after California's utilities neared insolvency and the state Department of Water Resources took over the purchasing of electricity for more than 25 million residents.  "They are vulnerable," Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman <NAME/> Bowen (D-<NAME/> del Rey) said of deals the state struck with independent power companies when prices were at record highs.  Bowen lauds <NAME/> administration negotiators for signing "the best deals they could." But she said that in the crisis atmosphere in which the negotiations took place, "the state had two cards and the generators had 50."  Contracts Open to Challenges  The contracts could be challenged in court or, more immediately, before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington. There, an administrative law judge could direct that the pacts be reworked as part of a settlement of allegations by <NAME/> that generators overcharged the state for electricity by $8.9 billion.  "We ought not to say, 'Fine, the contracts were the best we could do,' " Bowen said.  For his part, <NAME/> says he is willing to accept partial payment of the $8.9 billion in the form of contracts with terms more favorable to the state. He attributes the recent sharp drop in wholesale electricity prices to conservation, the administration's effort to increase power supply and--a major factor--the long-term contracts, which slashed the state's reliance on the volatile daily, or spot, market.  "You can see the value of these long-term contracts . . . dramatically shrinking our overall price, which is what matters to Californians," <NAME/> said, pointing out that the average cost of power plunged 30% from May to June.  <NAME/> energy advisor S. <NAME/> <NAME/>, who helped negotiate the contracts, said they may end up costing less than $43 billion, given the recent decline in prices for natural gas, the main fuel for California's electricity-generating plants.  <NAME/> also compared critics to someone who calls the fire department to douse a blaze. "After the fire is out," he said, "you complain about the water damage."  The contracts have other defenders, among them UC Berkeley economics professor Severin Borenstein, who says the deals helped to tame the volatile spot market by reducing generators' incentive to drive up prices, while reducing the state's exposure to wild swings in price.  "The point of signing long-term contracts is not to get a great price; it's to reduce risk," Borenstein said.  Still, experts have been picking through the pacts ever since a Superior Court judge in San <NAME/>, ruling in a California Public Records Act lawsuit by news organizations and Republican lawmakers, ordered last month that <NAME/> unseal the contracts.  An analysis done for the Assembly by three experts--one each representing Southern California <NAME/>; the Utility Reform Network, a consumer group; and large electricity consumers--concluded that the about $43-billion price tag announced by the administration may not account for all the costs. When other expenses are factored in--ranging from environmental equipment upgrades to any new energy-related taxes--the contracts could cost an additional 10% to 20%.  "Once the contracts were made public," Senate Republican leader <NAME/> Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said, "just about anyone who can read began calling for those contracts to be renegotiated."  As buyers' remorse spreads through the Capitol, the contracts increasingly are seen as a hurdle--or a bargaining chip--as <NAME/> and lawmakers confront fast-approaching deadlines in their effort to prevent the energy crisis from morphing into a broader financial crisis.  A bill pushed by <NAME/> to avert bankruptcy for the financially hobbled Southern California <NAME/> must be approved by Aug. 15. The deadline could be tighter, because the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn for a monthlong break July 20.  <NAME/>' rescue plan, along with legislative alternatives, languishes in the Legislature. The plan, which has little apparent support, would require the state to buy <NAME/>'s system of transmission lines for $2.76 billion and permit the utility to charge ratepayers for the rest of its back debt of $3.5 billion.  Some lobbyists and lawmakers believe that the electricity rate hike approved in March by the California Public Utilities Commission--at 3 cents a kilowatt-hour the largest in state history--may not be enough. The revenue generated under the new rate structure must cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and repay the planned $13.4 billion in bonds, which would be the largest municipal deal ever.  Whether there would be sufficient money left to pay for the <NAME/> rescue remains to be seen. But some experts say the utility may need to seek a separate rate hike to cover its costs.  As written, the contracts have few escape clauses; <NAME/> cannot simply walk away from them if he concludes that prices are too high. Still, criticism persists and crosses political lines.  <NAME/> Snyder, longtime Sacramento lobbyist for Consumers Union, and <NAME/> <NAME/>, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn., rarely find themselves on the same side of a debate. But in separate interviews, they sounded similar themes.  "If there is a way to buy our way out of these contracts, even if we have to pay damages, we'd be better off in the long run," Snyder said.  <NAME/>, like other business leaders, does not advocate abrogating the contracts. But like many familiar with the terms, he hopes that some deals can be renegotiated.  "They are problematic," he said.  In a move that critics fear could lock in high electricity prices for the next decade, the <NAME/> administration is pushing the PUC to agree within a month to limit its authority to question costs incurred by the Department of Water Resources as it goes about procuring power.  State Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides said the PUC must act so he can complete the $13.4-billion bond sale. A binding agreement is necessary so that Wall Street investors can be assured that they will be repaid.  "The state will be out of cash by the end of the year without the bond sale," he said. "We will move toward fiscal insolvency."  The so-called rate agreement, a draft of which was obtained by The Times, would bind customers of the three big regulated utilities to pay more than just the principal and interest on the $13.4 billion in bonds. Consumers would have to pay for consultants, lawyers, to pay taxes, fees and other as-yet-undefined charges that may be incurred by the Department of Water Resources.  Additionally, the PUC would be obligated to approve payments for programs by which the state would pay large and small customers to cut electricity use, although the Legislature has not approved the programs and their details remain to be worked out. The Department of Water Resources estimates the cost to be $800 million, spread over this year and next.  "It is loaded up," Senate President Pro Tem <NAME/> <NAME/> (D-San <NAME/>) said of the proposed rate deal, adding that it would require the commission to "raise rates to cover whatever the Department of Water Resources decides to do."  "That is giving a blank check to some bureaucratic office," he said.  'Dictatorial Power' Warning  <NAME/> of the manufacturers group also is alarmed by the plan, saying it would provide the water agency with "dictatorial power."  "As skeptical as we are of the PUC process, at least there is a process," <NAME/> said, referring to the commission's procedures to set electricity rates. "There is no process for DWR. DWR just tells the PUC, 'This is what we need,' and the PUC must approve it."  Others say the rate agreement is a standard piece of work, given the extraordinary step the Legislature took in January when it authorized the Department of Water Resources to buy power for utilities that had fallen so deeply into debt that they could no longer carry out their obligation to consumers.  In essence, <NAME/> energy advisor <NAME/> said, lawmakers in January created "the equivalent of a public power purchasing agency" beyond the jurisdiction of the PUC.  "There is no public power agency in California that is reviewed by the PUC," said <NAME/>, former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.  *  Times staff writer <NAME/> Rivera <NAME/> in Los Angeles contributed to this story.  Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times        State's refund demand rejected  Judge ends rebate talks, rebukes $9 billion claim  <NAME/> Coile, <NAME/> Berthelsen, Chronicle Staff Writers  Tuesday, July 10, 2001  ?2001 San <NAME/> Chronicle   URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=3D/c/a/2001/07/10/MN117914.DTL   Washington -- An administrative law judge, delivering a powerful message to Gov. Gray <NAME/> and California energy officials, cast aside the state's claim that it is owed $8.9 billion in electricity overcharges by generators and called for further hearings to determine "hard numbers."  The judge, ending talks designed to settle the dispute between California and power sellers, said the state and its cash-strapped utilities may owe more in unpaid electricity bills than they are owed for overcharges by the generators.  The comments by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chief administrative law Judge <NAME/> L. Wagner, although a strong endorsement of the generators' position, seemed to indicate that neither side wanted to settle the issue before it reached the five-member regulatory commission.  "There are refunds due (to California) that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars," Wagner said yesterday.  "At the same time, there are sums due to sellers from the California Independent System Operator and the investor-owned utilities in the state of California that probably are higher than any overcharges that (the state) may come up with."  Now, it will be up to the federal regulators to settle the case. But the recommendations by Wagner, who mediated the talks, carry significant weight with the commission and cast doubt on the state's chances of collecting the full $8.9 billion it claims to be owed.  The judge said he will recommend that the commission order new hearings to calculate what the state and the power sellers are each owed. The hearings would be overseen by an administrative law judge and would last 45 to 60 days, Wagner said.  CLOSING SESSION Wagner made his comments in the closing session of the 15-day talks, which were ordered last month by the regulatory commission to try to defuse the dispute between power wholesalers and California officials before it reached the courts.  The judge's message was a sharp rebuke to the unyielding stand by California leaders -- especially <NAME/>, who last week said he wouldn't take a dime less than $8.9 billion for California's consumers.  The governor issued a statement shortly after the close of talks insisting that California had won its basic case that the state is owed refunds.  "I am pleased that Judge Wagner accepted our methodology for calculating refunds and rejected the generators' position that no refunds are due," <NAME/> said.  The governor's chief representative at the talks, <NAME/> Kahn, called the judge's statement a "ringing endorsement" of the state's call for refunds. Kahn said the judge's order would improve the state's legal position if it files suit against power sellers.  GENERATORS FAVORED But much of the judge's order seemed to favor the generators.  For example, state officials have made the case they should be refunded $8. 9 billion for alleged overcharges from May 2000 to May 2001 -- even though the regulatory commission has said only that the period starting Oct. 2, 2000 could be considered.  The judge said yesterday that he would stick with the October date, meaning that more than a third of the state's claim -- at least $3 billion -- would not be refunded by the commission.  <NAME/> Bailey, vice president and general counsel of <NAME/> Energy North America, said that under Wagner's guidelines, the state may be eligible for $1 billion to $1.5 billion.  "Certainly to the extent that it helped refute what California has been saying, it's a victory," Bailey said of the judge's statement.  But <NAME/> said the nation's big power sellers never came to the table with a serious offer.  "Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepayers out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good faith," <NAME/> said.  $716 MILLION OFFER  Wagner disclosed yesterday that the generators had made an offer to California: $716 million in refunds.  The judge said the figure included about $510 million from the so-called Big Five generators, as well as $125 million from BC Hydro's Powerex, $49.6 million by a group of 15 electricity marketers, $16.5 million by six California municipal utilities and $25 million offered by other out-of-state power sellers.  California officials say it was not a legitimate offer because it included no cash. It was simply an agreement by the companies to wipe some of the state's debt off the books.  Throughout the talks, generators complained that the California team was trying to shield some California companies and government power providers from having to pay any refunds, and trying to disproportionately extract sums from out-of-state power companies.  FAVORITISM CHARGED According to documents and interviews, the state attempted to remove Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California <NAME/>, San <NAME/> Gas & Electric., the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and other government power suppliers from the group from which it was asking for refunds, even though they were paid the same high rates for power as everyone else.  Representatives for the power sellers said they believe that <NAME/> made a political decision to demagogue the companies while refusing to compromise on the state's claims. They say the governor calculated that his reputation would be enhanced by continuing to attack the generators.  "The California delegation did not come into these talks with any willingness to compromise," said <NAME/> Stultz, vice president of the Electric Power Supply Association, a Washington, D.C., trade group. "They went in with a dollar figure and never budged on that figure. If you're looking for a settlement, you have to be willing to compromise."  Up next 1. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will consider, probably on July 25,  new hearings on how much, if anything, California was overcharged. 2. If ordered by the commission, an administrative law judge will take testimony on how much the state says it was overcharged and how much generators say they are owed. 3.

Gray <NAME/> celebrated the startup of a new power plant in Pittsburg yesterday -- the latest in a string of openings <NAME/> hopes will help California "build its way" out of the energy crisis. The state rushed to throw as many megawatts on line as it could when it looked like the summer would feature regular blackouts, and yesterday the governor said it was paying off.  "This is the third plant I've helped open in the last 13 days," <NAME/> said, pumping his fist as the Calpine Corp. plant belched an impressive burst of steam. "In the past 13 days, we've put more power on the grid than California did throughout the 1990s."  The 555-megawatt Los Medanos Energy Center and the Sutter Energy Center that Calpine opened in Yuba City last week bring a total of 1,115 megawatts online. Last month, <NAME/> threw the switch on a Bakersfield plant that opened more than a month ahead of schedule.  <NAME/> used yesterday's event to blast out-of-state generators that he maintains have gouged the state for electricity. Yet he lauded San <NAME/>-based Calpine as a sort of energy favorite son.  "They were the first to enter long-term contracts with us," the governor said. Calpine is among the big energy firms being pressed by the state to issue refunds for what the governor insists were overcharges, but unlike the others, <NAME/> said, Calpine is giving ground in negotiations.  "They likely will be the first to enter into settlements with us," he said.  Although the Los Medanos plant is one of a generation of efficient new gas- fired plants that will be as much as 40 percent cheaper to run than their forebears, the state will be paying well above current market rates for the first three months of its contract with Calpine.  Calpine President <NAME/> Cartwright insisted, however, that the company is not making excess profits off the deal. To ensure that Calpine could provide the electricity even if plant construction wasn't finished by its mid-July target date, the company bought the needed power from other energy traders at $232 a megawatt hour when market rates were higher, he said.  In addition to the 300 megawatts it has pledged to the state, Calpine will supply electricity to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and other power agencies.  In the long term, Calpine will be selling power to California at $59 a megawatt hour, Cartwright said.  A spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which started buying power in January after state utilities buckled under high prices, said Calpine's rate is well below the $70 a megawatt hour the state is aiming for as an average price for the long-term contracts.  Cartwright said that with its recently opened plants, along with an 875- megawatt facility it plans to open in Pittsburg next May, the company is doing its share to ease the state's supply crunch.  "Ours are the lowest contracts in the state," he said. "If these plants weren't online, we'd be having blackouts."  A spokeswoman from the state agency that manages the power grid said California is skating so close to blackouts that "every megawatt counts."  "It's definitely making a difference and it will continue to do so over the summer," said <NAME/> O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the Independent System Operator.

Hydro $125 million settlement   Tuesday, July 10, 2001  ?2001 Associated Press  URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/07/10/state0321EDT0105.DTL   (07-10) 00:21 PDT VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) --  California has rejected an offer by B.C. Hydro's power trading subsidiary to refund $125 million to settle the state's allegations that it was overcharged by the Canadian power company.  The dispute will now be resolved by U.S. judicial and regulatory authorities.  The offer from Hydro's Powerex subsidiary came during 15 days of settlement talks between power generators and distributors, California and other western states.  The talks, initiated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates cross-border power sales in the United States, concluded Monday evening without resolution.  Hydro spokeswoman Elisha Odowichuk said that under the offer, the Crown corporation would have been subtracted $125 million from the $290 million California still owes British Columbia for power sales.  The $125 million was Powerex's first offer and it did not change through the negotiations, she said. The company put conditions on that refund figure, but Odowichuk would not say what those conditions were.  California has charged that Powerex gouged it by more than $430 million. Odowichuk said Hydro had to join the settlement talks to preserve its otherwise lucrative power trading relationship with California.  Electricity imports and exports statistics compiled by Canada's National Energy Board show Powerex exported more than $900 million worth of energy from January to April.  The average cost of that power was $661.56 a megawatt hour.  Prices have dropped to around $140 a megawatt hour since the regulatory commission instituted price caps on June 19.  ?2001 Associated Press         <NAME/>' criticism of Texas misdirected, report finds  <NAME/> Gledhill, <NAME/> <NAME/>, Chronicle Staff Writers  Tuesday, July 10, 2001  ?2001 San <NAME/> Chronicle   URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/chronicle/archive/2001/07/10/MN48875.DTL   Sacramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of criticism from Gov. Gray <NAME/> for gouging California during the power crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share of the money went elsewhere.  Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private energy companies from Canada to <NAME/> to California got the rest.  The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas.  Earlier this year, <NAME/> lambasted the Bush administration for not acting against power firms in his home state. "What's going on here, pure and simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- most of them, incidentally, located in Texas," he said in May.  Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators who have also gouged California.  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind," said <NAME/> Maviglio, <NAME/>' spokesman.  The latest financial information is contained in a report by the state Department of Water Resources detailing $7.2 billion in power purchases from Jan. 17 through the end of May.  About $5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are made a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually used.  Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropped as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of events that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could recover from customers.  The numbers released yesterday show that Texas companies weren't alone in receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2 billion went to Mirant, an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to turn over documents subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its investigation into alleged market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt proceedings.  Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis. Powerex,  a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC Hydro, received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which <NAME/> said charged higher average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 million.

The DWR report says the energy companies that were paid the most by the state for last-minute power were: Mirant Corp., which was paid $1.24 billion as of the end of May; Canada-based Powerex, $1.05 billion; and Sempra Companies, $429 million.  * <NAME/> ceremonially switches on the largest licensed power plant to come online this year, Calpine's 559-megawatt Los Medanos Energy Center in Pittsburg.  * No power alerts as electricity reserves stay above 7 percent.  * Shares of <NAME/> International closed at $14, up 69 cents.

THE PROBLEM: High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis.  Southern California <NAME/> and Pacific Gas and Electric say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June 2000 to high wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San <NAME/> Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger <NAME/> and PG&E but is also struggling with high wholesale power costs.  The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 37 percent for the heaviest residential customers and 38 percent for commercial customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15 percent or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.

"I think we have demonstrated very clearly both to the FERC and to the judge that the state is owed $8.9 billion and will settle for nothing less," said <NAME/> Salazar, a spokesman for Gov. Gray <NAME/>.  With negotiations at an impasse, the administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said California is probably owed no more than $1 billion in refunds.  "The numbers were too far apart," said <NAME/> Wagner, the FERC chief administrative law judge.  California, Wagner said, may receive nothing at all, because generators may be owed more than they have to return for any overcharges.  He placed the refunds owed the state at between $716 million and $1 billion. Power providers had offered $716 million as part of an overall settlement, while California state officials sought $8.9 billion, Wagner said.  He said California officials had not made the case for $8.9 billion in refunds.  Salazar, however, said the state would go to court and may ask for $20 billion.  Separately, Wagner split off claims of overcharges from the Pacific Northwest, saying he has not had time to consider those allegations under the short timetable ordered by FERC last month.  Wagner served as a mediator during the 15 days of negotiations and will recommend a settlement to FERC by next Monday. The commission ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences between producers and the state over the breakdown of California's deregulated electricity market.  Consumer advocates assailed the judge's recommendation and urged the state to continue its attempt to get refunds from what they say are profiteering power companies.  "It's like catching a bank robber, but instead of making him give back all of it, you only make him give back 5 percent of what he stole," said <NAME/> Heller, spokesman for the Santa <NAME/>-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.  Power generators, however, were generally pleased with Wagner's comments.  <NAME/> Bailey, general counsel for <NAME/> Energy, said even if the formula Wagner recommends produces $1.5 billion in refunds, "that's a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks."  California officials, negotiating on behalf of utilities, the Public Utilities Commission and state power buyers, accused the producers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices.  The producers have acknowledged prices are high, but blame jumps in the price of natural gas, which fuels many power plants, and the workings of the free market.  The bill for wholesale power in California soared to $27 billion last year from $7 billion the year before. <NAME/> has estimated the state could spend as much as $50 billion this year.  The producers reiterated Monday that California's numbers are grossly inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators -- <NAME/> Energy, Dynegy, Mirant, Reliant Energy and the <NAME/> Cos. -- said in a statement that they have made a "very substantial global settlement offer."  Reliant would agree to no more than $50 million in refunds as part of an overall settlement that also would have to include protection from additional legal claims, said <NAME/> H. Stout, a company senior vice president.  But Stout also said, "Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains that no refunds are justified."       Toxic fumes not linked to blackouts  Backup power OK in facilities, report says  <NAME/> B. <NAME/>son, Chronicle Staff Writer  Tuesday, July 10, 2001  ?2001 San <NAME/> Chronicle   URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/chronicle/archive/2001/07/10/MNC115768.DTL   Despite a power-related mishap that released toxic fumes from an industrial plant in May, rolling blackouts are not expected to cause dangerous releases in Contra Costa, a county study concludes.  The county Health Department report found that 52 industrial facilities have adequate backup power plans.  The report to be presented to the Board of Supervisors today was prompted by a freak traffic accident that knocked out power at Richmond's General Chemical Corp. plant. When the plant powered back up, a cloud of sulfur trioxide and sulfur dioxide was released.  Contra Costa hazardous materials director Lew Pascalli said that there is always a possibility that a plant's hydraulic or mechanical systems could fail but that those chances are slight given the growing number of power plants coming online and the state's successful conservation effort.  He also said industry has done a good job preparing for outages.  "The industry is doing a good-faith effort in this particular instance to make sure that nothing happens," Pascalli said.  County officials relied on industry records in determining the adequacy of the different plans, such as having multiple electrical leads feeding a source regulating hazardous materials.  <NAME/> Larson, spokesman for the group Communities for a Better Environment, said the report relied too heavily on industry self-reporting.  "Unfortunately, the conclusions of the report can't be backed up by the facts," Larson said. "Oil and chemical plants in Contra Costa have repeatedly had toxic releases due to power failures over the years."  The 52 facilities include chemical plants, oil refineries and small shops that produce limited amounts of hazardous materials.  For many of these businesses, the loss of power would shut down their operations and make it impossible for substances to be released.  Larger facilities, like oil refineries, have either their own backup generators or contracts with cogeneration plants that could supply all or most of their power independent of the electricity power grid, according to the report.  Plans are also in place to conduct partial shutdowns at plants running on reserve power during a blackout.  General Chemical said all electrical feeds to the chamber processing chemicals are automatically pulled in the event of loss of power. A backup generator will automatically come online to keep operations stable.  Dow Chemical has a contract with a Calpine power plant to supply it with electricity. Battery backup and diesel emergency engines are also at the site to ensure enough power to run lights, alarms, controls and emergency shutdown equipment.  e-mail <NAME/> B. <NAME/>son at jbjohnson@sfchronicle.com .  ?2001 San <NAME/> Chronicle    Page A - 11         Power suppliers, state fail to agree on refund total  Posted at 10:41 p.m. PDT Monday, July 9, 2001  BY JIM PUZZANGHERA   Mercury News Washington Bureau    WASHINGTON -- California officials and power suppliers failed to agree on refunds for electricity overcharges as 15 days of contentious negotiations ended Monday, leaving the matter in the hands of a federal judge who said the state is owed much less than the $8.9 billion it demands.  The judge overseeing the talks for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission put the refunds at between several hundred million dollars and a billion dollars. His estimate is closer to the $716.1 million offer made by power suppliers during negotiations. The offer was rejected by California officials.  But it was unclear Monday which side in the bitter refund battle would prevail, and California officials indicated the dispute is probably headed to court. At stake is how much the state's electricity consumers will ultimately have to pay for costs that skyrocketed as California's deregulation system collapsed.  <NAME/> Wagner, the commission's chief administrative law judge, will recommend a formula for the commission to use to calculate a refund dating back to October. That formula -- a complex methodology that involves factors such as daily natural gas prices -- includes many of the provisions the energy suppliers had advocated during the talks.  <NAME/> Kahn, who headed the California negotiating team, said the state would contest some aspects of the formula. But even without changes, Kahn said he was confident the formula will result in more refunds than Wagner estimated.  ``We think the numbers even using the judge's formula are going to be in the multiple billions,'' said Kahn, chairman of the state Independent System Operator, which runs the electricity grid. ``California will get its $8.9 billion dollars. If we don't get all of it from the commission . . . we'll still get the remainder of the money'' through the courts.  Amount in dispute  Power industry representatives appeared pleased with the judge's plan.  ``We haven't gone and run the full numbers but it's going to be nowhere near the $8.9 billion,''' said <NAME/> Bailey, vice president and general counsel for <NAME/> Energy North America. ``But let's face it, that's a pie-in-the-sky number that nobody in there believed in their right mind was a legitimate number.''  Wagner acknowledged he had not calculated any figures using his formula, saying he arrived at his dollar estimate based on the offers made by the suppliers.  The energy commission ordered the private settlement conference last month when it enacted new price controls to try to rein in soaring electricity prices in California and throughout the West. Commissioners hoped that under pressure of a deadline and their looming intervention the state and the power suppliers could resolve the refund issue and stave off future litigation.  But the suppliers and state officials never came close to a deal, participants said.  ``The numbers were too far apart. You saw $8.9 billion on one end and you saw $716 million on the other end, and that's a long way to splitting the difference,'' Wagner said. ``I think a lot of the parties genuinely wanted to settle. Others didn't.''  Wagner now has until Monday to make his recommendation to the five-member commission, which will make the final ruling on refunds. To date, the commission has ordered $125 million in refunds for periods since last Oct. 2.  Wagner said Monday that he will ask that a special hearing be set up in the next 60 days to get the detailed information from the state and power suppliers needed to determine a refund total using his formula.  The state may not end up with any cash, as any refund total could be applied to the several billion dollars California and its utilities still owe many of the power suppliers.  Reflecting the tone of the negotiations, California Gov. Gray <NAME/> on Monday blamed power suppliers for the failure of the talks and challenged the commission to resolve the situation.  ``Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepayers out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good faith with our team in Washington, D.C.,'' <NAME/> said. ``While in the past the FERC has shown little, if any, interest in consumers, they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 billion California has demonstrated it is owed.''  <NAME/> may go to court  At the opening of a new power plant in Contra Costa County on Monday, <NAME/> told reporters that he's prepared to take the power generators to court if FERC doesn't order the full refund. <NAME/> also said the ISO's estimate of $8.9 billion doesn't represent all the overcharges. He said other estimates put the figure as high as $20 billion, although he did not elaborate about how those figures were calculated.  <NAME/> H. Stout, senior vice president for Reliant Energy Wholesale Group, said the state used faulty methodology to arrive at the $8.9 billion figure.  California officials and several suppliers said they would continue to negotiate separately, and an official with San <NAME/>-based Calpine said his company is close to a settlement with the state.  Power suppliers urged Wagner not to calculate refunds by applying the energy commissions' June price-limits plan retroactively. But that's what Wagner said he will do. It was a victory for California officials, who had pushed for it. Wagner, however, also made some changes to the price-limit plan that power suppliers had wanted. He applied it only back to Oct. 2, 2000. State officials wanted it to cover up to May 2000.  $3 billion difference  The state's $8.9 billion figure comes from May 2000 through May 2001. Factoring refunds beginning with Oct. 2, 2000, eliminates about $3 billion in overcharges the state says occurred in the earlier period.  Among the changes to the commission's formula that Wagner made was to revise the way the prevailing electricity price limit is calculated. Wagner wants the price limit determined for each hour of each day. The commission's formula sets a price limit during Stage One power emergencies that remains in effect until the next emergency.  But in a sign of just how complex the issue is, <NAME/> University economist <NAME/> Wolak said he believes the standards described by the judge will produce a much higher figure than $1 billion.  ``That's the methodology the state used,'' said Wolak, who advises the California ISO on market issues. ``By using the marginal unit for each hour, you'll get refund numbers on the order of what the state estimated.''

Power purchase bills exceed $7.5 billion  Published Tuesday, July 10, 2001, in the San <NAME/> Mercury News  BY MARK GLADSTONE, NOAM LEVEY AND DION NISSENBAUM   Mercury News Sacramento Bureau    SACRAMENTO -- Six months after jumping into the electricity business, the <NAME/> administration on Monday provided the first detailed glimpse of California's daily power purchases, showing more than $5 billion in payments, much of it to government-owned utilities and private companies that state officials have branded as price gougers.  The state spent an additional $2.5 billion on a variety of contracts and other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy markets, according to documents that the state agreed to release last week amid a legal dispute over public access to the data.  In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2 billion to Atlanta-based Mirant, the most any company was paid for electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro in British Columbia. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.  The documents raise questions about some of the common assumptions that have arisen around the electricity crisis. For instance, almost 40 percent of the state's purchases have come from government-run power generators in California and elsewhere, but not Texas; some of the biggest suppliers are from the Northwest.  Gov. Gray <NAME/>, who has ambitions to run for the White House, has put much of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies based in President Bush's home state.  The figures are tucked inside 1,770 of pages of invoices that <NAME/> has resisted divulging, saying disclosure would encourage suppliers to charge more. The state, which last month released information on its long-term electricity contracts worth $43 billion, agreed Thursday to release the first quarter details.  Short on explanation  The figures were disclosed late Monday by the California Department of Water Resources, which buys power for the state's financially strapped major utilities, and seem to buttress the administration's contention that the price of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for what prompted the decrease.  In January, for instance, the average price for power on the spot market was $321 a megawatt hour. It peaked in April at $332 and dropped to $271 in May.  One megawatt powers about 750 homes.  <NAME/> spokesman <NAME/> Maviglio said the price data supports the governor's assertions that California has been gouged. ``The bad guys are clearly the out-of-state generators,'' Maviglio said. ``There has been a significant shift of money out of California.''  But the documents fail to shed much light on whether, as the administration contends, the price drop was due to long-term power contracts negotiated by the state earlier this year. Critics contend that the <NAME/> administration panicked and rushed into deals that commit the state to pay high prices for many years.  Used for support  Republican officials used the price information to bolster their attacks against <NAME/>, a Democrat, for signing long-term contracts with power generators even as the price of power on the spot market was coming down, partly because of the declining price of natural gas used to fuel many plants.  ``It's more clear than ever that the long-term contracts are a bad deal,'' said Assemblyman <NAME/> Strickland, R-Camarillo. ``The governor's really hurt the ratepayers for the next five or 10 years.''  The newly released bills highlight the volatility of California's energy market, where the price per megawatt hour ranged from $70 to $1,000. On any given day, the records show, the prices from seller to seller varied widely, with some of the highest prices being charged by public utilities and companies outside Texas.  On one day in February, for example, San <NAME/>-based Sempra Energy was charging $165 per megawatt hour, the <NAME/> Water and Electric Board was charging nearly $500 and <NAME/> Energy, a North <NAME/> company, was charging up to $575.  The state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million for all power, including the spot market and contracted power.  The state began buying power in mid-January on behalf of the state's major utilities, which were unable to borrow money to buy power after amassing enormous debts for electricity.  San <NAME/>-based Calpine Corp., which is building several new power plants around California including one in South San <NAME/>, did only $29 million worth of business with the state in the first five months of the year, according to the figures.  The state began buying power in mid-January when Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California <NAME/> Co. were on the ropes financially. PG&E later went into bankruptcy.  On Monday, state lawmakers took another shot at trying to cobble together a plan to rescue financially ailing <NAME/>.  While most concede that a rescue plan <NAME/> worked out with <NAME/> will not win the necessary support in the Legislature, lawmakers have created several working groups to come up with alternatives.  Compromise plan  On Monday, state Sen. <NAME/> Sher, D-Redwood City, unveiled the latest compromise proposal that seeks to protect average ratepayers and small businesses from further rate increases and forces everyone else to help finance the <NAME/> bailout.  The ``shared pain'' proposal would force power producers, owed about $1 billion, to take a 30 percent ``haircut'' and agree to forgive about $300 million in <NAME/> debts. <NAME/> would be asked to swallow $1.2 billion -- about a third of its debt. And big users would be asked to pay off the remaining $2 billion in debts, possibly by paying higher prices for power.  In exchange, large companies would be given the opportunity to buy power on the open market, a system that would allow many of them to sign cheap energy deals.  Sher presented the proposal to Senate Democrats Monday afternoon, but it remains unclear how much support the framework will receive in the Legislature.

             Refund outlook dims  Talks break down; judge says state is owed much less than its $8.9 billion demand -- and unpaid bills may offset gains.  July 10, 2001  By DENA BUNIS and JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Register  WASHINGTON The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California is owed maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the $8.9 billion demanded by Gov. Gray <NAME/>.  And even at that, said Judge <NAME/> Wagner, the electricity sellers are owed so much more in unpaid power bills that in the end California might not see one red cent.  Wagner announced his recommendation to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission after two weeks of fruitless negotiations between all the parties to California's electricity crisis. With no settlement, the matter is now in the commissioners' hands.  Power generators, Wagner said, had offered a combined $716 million in refunds, an offer the state rejected. "I don't think it's 8.9 (billion dollars)," he said afterwards, "because I haven't been shown that it was."  For California consumers, every dollar the state can extract in refunds is a dollar less that ratepayers have to shell out for state-purchased power. And the more money the state gets back, the better the chances of warding off future rate increases.  "California will get its $8.9 billion," insisted <NAME/> Kahn, head of the state's delegation and the California Independent System Operator. Kahn brushed off Wagner's comments, finding victory in the judge's assertion that the state is owed some refunds, a concept the generators have been unwilling to embrace up to now, he said.  Since the talks began, some generators have made refund offers -- last week <NAME/> Energy offered $20 million and on Monday, Reliant officials revealed their refund offer was $50 million, provided all other actions against the company were dropped.  But the net result of the 15- day closed-door sessions is that California is no closer to getting repaid for what it claims was price gouging by power companies going back to May 2000 than it was the day the talks began.  And it means the state is in for possibly more hearings before the FERC. If unsuccessful there, the whole issue could wind up in court for years.  "You can take a horse to water but cannot make him drink," Wagner said during an afternoon public session where he made his preliminary recommendation. He has seven days to put his ideas in writing. At several points during the often-tense talks, Wagner expressed frustration to the negotiators and tried to get them to agree, even to the point of holding an unprecedented Sunday session.  "The numbers were too far apart," Wagner said.  While Kahn insisted the state had made progress, on hearing of the judge's comments, state Sen. <NAME/> <NAME/>, D-<NAME/>, called them "barely better than a jab in the eye with a sharp stick." <NAME/> agreed with Kahn that the state has to do all it can to get more than that.  And <NAME/> backed up his team.  "Our delegation made a clear and compelling factual argument that there were overcharges made because the market was broken," <NAME/> said. "Remarkably, the energy generators and suppliers refused to recognize their responsibility to the people of California and own up to their profiteering."  Power generators seemed satisfied with the judge's views, even though <NAME/> Stout, vice president of Reliant Energy, said his company's "fundamental position has been and remains that no refunds are justified."  <NAME/> Bailey, general counsel for <NAME/> Energy, called the judge's recommendation, "a fair one."  Republican lawmakers in Sacramento were quick to say it was <NAME/>' failed energy policies that brought California to this point. They also distanced themselves from the state's refund request.  "I don't believe there really exists a true justification for that number," said Assemblyman <NAME/> Campbell, R-Irvine. "I've never considered that anything more than a wild number to throw out there."  The two sides are so far apart in their estimates of overcharges because they are using different assumptions about how to compute the complex pricing structure. And Wagner was more persuaded with the majority of the generators' methods.  To start with, the state is asking for $8.9 billion, but about $3 billion of those alleged overcharges happened between May and October 2000, a period FERC is not looking at. FERC issued two refund orders in March, finding that power companies had $124 million in overcharges during power alerts. But the state is challenging that finding, saying there were overcharges beyond those limited times. And the state is also asking FERC to reconsider allowing refunds for May to October 2000.  How energy panel affects California  Six months ago, few people had heard of FERC. Now the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency charged with making sure that the nation's power markets are running smoothly and that wholesale prices are "just and reasonable," rolls off the tongue.  The five commissioners who make up FERC - all of whom were members of their home state's Public Utilities Commissions - ordered the settlement talks that concluded Monday. They had hoped all the parties involved in California's electricity crisis could reach an agreement on proposed refunds, long-term power contracts and other issues that have divided the parties for months. FERC's chief judge, <NAME/> Wagner, was asked to mediate the talks.  WHAT WAS AT STAKE?  For the state: $8.9 billion that Gov. Gray <NAME/> said was the amount power companies overcharged California in the past year. Wagner's finding? There should be refunds. But more like $1 billion.  For the generators: More than $5 billion that they say they are owed for unpaid power bills. Wagner's finding? Generators are owed more money than the refunds they owe California. He did not specify by how much.  For California consumers: A stable electricity market. Until the refund issue is settled and power prices are stabilized long term, what the future holds for rate increase remains uncertain. Wagner's finding? No settlement. Consumers still in limbo.  HOW DID WE GET HERE?  In spring 2000, wholesale power prices began to soar. The state began appealing to FERC to cap wholesale prices. In the meantime the utilities were running out of money. Generators weren't paid for all the electricity they sold. Rolling blackouts began.  Starting in January, the state began buying the power, replacing the near-bankrupt utilities. Politicians from Sacramento to Washington increased the pressure on FERC to cap rates. More than $27 billion was spent to buy power for California last year, compared with $7 billion the year before. The price tag could reach $50 billion this year.  On June 19, FERC imposed the kind of soft price caps experts say could moderate wholesale rates. Wholesale prices have come down, but the caps have caused confusion among generators, leading some to hold some power off the market.  WHAT'S NEXT?  The FERC commissioners will receive Wagner's report within a week. In it, he will suggest they hold a fast-track formal hearing that would last no more than 60 days.  If they agree, after that hearing the commission would rule on refunds and other California market issues.  If either the state or the other parties to this dispute disagree, they can contest FERC's decision in court. Such legal proceedings could last many years.                State reveals details of power purchases  Report shows last-minute energy buys in first three months of 2001.  July 10, 2001  By JENNIFER COLEMAN The Associated Press  SACRAMENTO On three days in May, California's daily power allowance topped $100 million, according to a report released by state power traders.  The California Department of Water Resources released the report Monday, along with 1,770 pages of documents that also detailed the last- minute power purchases the state made on the spot market in the first three months of the year.  The report details the department's electricity spending since Jan. 17, when the state took over electricity purchases for Pacific Gas & Electric Co., San <NAME/> Gas & Electric Co., and Southern California <NAME/>.  The utilities had amassed billions in debts and were no longer creditworthy enough to purchase power. Since then, the state has spent nearly $8 billion to keep the lights on.  The state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million. The second-highest daily total was May 23, when the state spent $101.8 million.  But since May, spot-market prices have dropped, due in part to moderate weather, lower natural gas prices, increased conservation that lowered demand and because of increased scrutiny by lawmakers and investigators into possible price manipulation. Gov. Gray <NAME/> has said long-term contracts also drove the price down.  "It does look like some of the spot-market prices have gone down, but it looks like it's primarily due to natural gas prices," said Jamie Fisfis, spokesman for Assembly Republicans.  The slight reduction in spot-market prices "underscores questions about the strategy of locking us into long-term contracts, if natural gas prices continue to drop," Fisfis said.  Most of the long-term contracts run for 10 years, with one lasting for 20 years.  <NAME/> already has released details of the state's long-term power contracts after losing a court battle with Republican legislators and several news organizations.  But <NAME/> wanted to delay the release of the spot-market buys and short-term contracts until now to keep the state's buying strategy secret.According to the state, Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. got $1.24 billion as of May 31 for spot-market purchases.  Canadian Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro, has been paid $1.05 billion.  The newly released short-term contracts also show that on March 19-20, when the state had rolling blackouts, the state paid above-average prices in its largest short-term contracts.  For example, Mirant sold the state 650 megawatt-hours at off-peak usage times on March 20 for $345 a megawatt-hour, more than $70 above the average price of $272.96.                 Tuesday, July 10, 2001        Ghost of <NAME/> Citron roaming halls of capitol  Gray <NAME/> is following footsteps of former O.C. treasurer into fiscal chaos     JOHN M.W. MOORLACH  Mr. Moorlach is the Orange County treasurer-tax collector.   A recent L.A. Times poll found that Californians still remain unconvinced that our state suffers from a shortage of energy. Perhaps the state's subsidizing of the actual costs for electricity these past five months has caused us to believe that everything is fine. It is not.  The state has been spending an average of $57 million, a medium-sized city's annual budget, per day for electricity. Now California is headed toward the same financial catastrophe that was imposed on its shareholder-owned utilities, finding one of them in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and another on the precipice. At this pace, it will not be long before the state will be staring a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing in the face.  That's why I'm gnawed by this "d?j? vu" sensation. The similarities and parallels between California of 2001 and Orange County of 1994 are frightening. Here's a refresher. In 1994 the county, through former Treasurer <NAME/> Citron, was borrowing at variable rates and investing at fixed rates. The "experts" and the "politicos" were comfortable with the investment scheme.  No wonder the electorate was convinced that there were no investing improprieties. Even while their former treasurer was very secretive about how he was investing and what his "exit strategy" would be. Guess what? The unexpected happened. Short-term borrowing rates doubled. The cost of borrowing suddenly exceeded the revenues being generated.  It caused the investment pool to implode and Orange County taxpayers realized a $1.64 billion loss. In spite of pleas to avoid or minimize this train wreck the county's leadership, he ignored it. The rest is history. In a half-pregnant deregulation scheme, the state capped the retail price that the utilities can charge. It also eliminated the availability to acquire electricity through the use of long-term contracts.  Guess what? The unexpected happened. The wholesale price for electricity spiked dramatically above the inflexible retail price cap. It depleted the available funds for the utilities, and then some, and they are imploding. In spite of pleas from the utilities imploring Gov. Gray <NAME/> to avoid or minimize this train wreck, he ignored them. The rest is also history.  It gets worse. <NAME/> doesn't allow for the immediate raising of retail rates and decides to have the state secretly purchase electricity. Guess what? The expected happened. He depleted our budget surplus! Our reserves! Nearly $9 billion - and counting! He's a Citron, only quintupled!  And in the light of day, the secret purchases were not attractively priced and only compound this financial nightmare. Gov. <NAME/> has done what no Libertarian or Republican could ever dream of doing in such a short time. He has returned the budget surplus created by taxpayers to the residents of California by subsidizing their electricity bills.  Bravo! It may not be the most equitable way of refunding taxes, but has anyone ever thought up a more efficient method? But, that's not all. He wants it back! <NAME/> now wants to borrow some $13 billion to replace the spent reserves and purchase even more electricity at rates in excess of the retail prices! When does this train wreck in slow motion stop?  And how do we pay off these bonds? <NAME/> did not want to raise rates last summer or this past winter. But now he will to pay off this historically largest municipal bond offering with a significant utility rate increase. The ratepayers will be reminded for 10 years after <NAME/> is gone about his expensive brilliance. And this elected official wants to purchase the power grids and bureaucratically manage the utilities? I say "no."  If we don't show some leadership in Sacramento soon, potential bond buyers will also say "no," unless they receive an attractive interest rate. Just ask <NAME/> International about attractive interest rates. It just subscribed $800 million in bonds paying 14 percent. Tragically, Gov. <NAME/> walked into his position with an existing budget surplus and now has no tangible legacy to show for it. No reserves. No improved highways. No new schools. No infrastructure improvements. Only interest payments.  Wasn't that Citron's legacy? If amortized over 10 years at 6 percent, the citizens of California will pay an additional $4.4 billion in interest costs. Over 15 years it's $6.7 billion. And therein lies the true legacy of <NAME/>, squandering the entire budget surplus that he inherited on interest resulting from his indecisiveness and lack of leadership!  It is so tragic that the perpetrator of this colossal mess is still in denial and continues to play the "blame game." Orange County played the "blame game," too. But it had obvious perpetrators and succeeded in a court of law in securing a significant amount in retribution payments. I'm not so sure California will have a similar result.            Calpine's Los Medanos Energy Center Adds Needed Generation to California Second New <NAME/> Base Load Generator for California        July 10, 2001      Second New <NAME/> Base Load Generator for California  SAN JOSE, Calif., July 9 /PRNewswire/ -- San <NAME/>, Calif.-based Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) announced today that its 555-megawatt Los Medanos Energy Center in Pittsburg, Calif. is providing needed electricity to California's strained power grid. Los Medanos is the second major combined-cycle facility to be licensed and built in California in over a decade. Fueled by natural gas, the facility is designed to add up to 555-megawatts of clean, reliable electricity to California on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week availability. As a cogeneration facility, the project also delivers electricity and steam to USS POSCO for use in industrial processing.  Governor Gray <NAME/> and Calpine CEO <NAME/> Cartwright will hold a press conference Monday afternoon to commission the Los Medanos Energy Center and to recognize the support of the local community, the construction and trades people, and numerous organizations that helped develop the facility.  Cartwright said, "We are committed to creating innovative energy solutions for California's growing power market. Los Medanos exemplifies excellence in power generation-ratepayers and the environment benefit as Calpine brings to California new energy resources like Los Medanos."  Los Medanos is the second of eleven announced modern, fuel-efficient energy centers Calpine is building in the State as part of a $6 billion energy initiative. Three additional facilities are under construction, including an 880-megawatt facility in Pittsburg at Dow Chemical's facility. By year-end 2005, Calpine expects to be generating 12,000 megawatts of clean, affordable electricity to help repower California.  Calpine broke ground on the Los Medanos Energy Center in September 1999. More than 600 construction and trade personnel worked on the project over a 20-month period. During the past several months, the project scheduled two ten-hour shifts, seven days a week to get the plant operating as soon as possible in light of the energy crisis. And over the past several weeks, technical teams worked round the clock to complete the facility. The total cost of construction is estimated to be approximately $350 million.  The Los Medanos Energy Center is located in Pittsburg, Calif., in Contra Costa County adjacent to the USS POSCO plant and is operated by a 22-member staff of highly trained personnel.  As with all of Calpine's modern base load facilities, Los Medanos uses combined-cycle design with natural gas-fired turbines in combination with a steam turbine to achieve maximum fuel efficiency. Advanced emissions control technology enables Calpine to reduce certain emissions by more than 90 percent.  Based in San <NAME/>, Calif., Calpine Corporation is dedicated to providing customers with reliable and competitively priced electricity. Calpine is focused on clean, efficient, natural gas-fired generation and is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy. Calpine has launched the largest power development program in North America. To date, the company has approximately 34,000 megawatts of base load capacity and 7,200 megawatts of peaking capacity in operation, under construction, pending acquisitions and in announced development in 29 states, the United Kingdom and Canada. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its Website at www.calpine.com.

The failure of the negotiations shifts the burden of resolving the yearlong dispute to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to which the mediator may recommend a pricing formula that would mean refunds of about $1 billion. California , which wants $8.9 billion, vowed today that it would seek that much and more, through the courts if necessary.  Although electricity prices in the West have eased in recent weeks, the power crisis that has afflicted California and other Western states seems unlikely to be resolved unless rival parties can agree on how much electricity should have cost during the last 13 months.  The power market has been mired in an accounting gridlock. The state claims that generating companies began grossly overcharging for electricity -- with prices soaring by a factor of 10 or 20 over year-before levels -- beginning in late spring last year. Generators say they are prepared to pay some refunds, but argue that California 's estimates of overcharges are radically inflated.  The mediator in the settlement talks was <NAME/> L. Wagner Jr., an administrative law judge for the federal agency, who said today that the negotiations had failed to reach the comprehensive voluntary settlement he had sought.  Mr. Wagner said he would recommend to the agency's commissioners that they convene a 60-day evidentiary hearing that would impose an administrative solution. He also said he would suggest a method for determining fair prices for electricity .  Under federal law, the energy commission has the obligation to ensure ''just and reasonable'' electricity rates. Though the commission declared last year that California 's electricity market had broken down, it only recently began imposing price controls on the market and has yet to address accusations of past overcharges systematically.  While the scope of any refunds remains uncertain, Mr. Wagner's remarks appeared more favorable for generators than for Western states, which have collectively pressed for as much as $15 billion in refunds.  Mr. Wagner said that to determine how much California should have paid for power since last September, when the commission began monitoring California energy prices, he would suggest that the agency retroactively apply a price control formula it adopted in June. He also indicated that he supported a way of calculating the costs of power generation that is closer to the method favored by power companies than to the one put forward by California officials. The judge suggested that the formula he is recommending could require generators to pay back hundreds of millions or ''maybe a billion'' dollars.  California officials gave a positive cast to the judge's statements, calling them a step forward because he formally acknowledged that companies would have to pay some refunds. They also noted that whatever the level of federally mandated refunds, they would have the option of seeking more in court.  ''We are still going to get the $8.9 billion,'' said <NAME/> Kahn, who represented Gov. Gray <NAME/> of California in the talks. ''If we don't get it all from the commission, we will get the remainder in the courts.''  Governor <NAME/> himself said today that if the agency did not provide refunds in the amount the state claims it is owed, it would sue generators for $18 billion to $20 billion. ''We are in a war with generators, mostly out of state, that are trying to bleed us dry,'' Mr. <NAME/> said, speaking at the ceremonial opening of a power plant in Northern California .  Representatives of several generating companies said that during the settlement talks, they collectively offered to refund California about $500 million. They estimated that the calculation method suggested by the judge would result in refunds of no more than $1.5 billion -- far closer to their offer than to California 's demand.  Still, several executives said they now hoped to reach individual settlements with the state that would end the threat of prolonged litigation and allow them to collect several billion dollars they say they are owed by the state and its leading, financially pressed utilities, which ran up huge debts to suppliers in the last year.  ''We remain very interested in reaching a global settlement with the state that will put this problem behind us once and for all,'' said <NAME/> Bailey, vice president and general counsel of <NAME/> Energy.       Financial  Energy Refund Talks Fail In Calif.; Federal Agency's Judge To Propose Settlement <NAME/> Behr    07/10/2001  The Washington Post  FINAL  Page E01  Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved  California consumers were overcharged by as much as $1 billion by electricity suppliers since October, a federal administrative judge said yesterday after state officials and power suppliers failed to reach an agreement on the disputed charges.  Gov. Gray <NAME/> (D) and California power officials wanted $8.9 billion in refunds dating back to May 2000, when the state's energy crisis began.  A group of generating companies headed by units of <NAME/> Energy Corp., Reliant Energy Inc. and <NAME/> Cos. offered refunds of $716.1 million in the past week, going back to October. The companies said refunds should be offset by the larger amounts they are owed for unpaid power deliveries to the state.  "The numbers were too far apart," <NAME/> L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, told reporters after two weeks of closed negotiations ended yesterday. Wagner acknowledged that his refund number was imprecise and said further hearings before FERC are needed to pin down the figure.  Calpine Corp. of San <NAME/> and possibly one other supplier are expected to reach individual settlements with the state, the judge said.  "A lot of the parties genuinely wanted to settle and others didn't," Wagner told reporters. "There's an old southern saying," said the 72-year-old Tennessean. "You can take a horse to water, but you can't make it drink."  He declined to say which side balked, but previously he had blasted California officials for not modifying their initial demands.  Wagner said he will send his own refund formula to FERC's five commissioners within a week. His formula essentially will reflect what he thinks reasonable electricity prices would have been in the state at various times since October, considering fuel costs and other factors. Charges over those levels would be subject to refund, if FERC agrees.  The judge's recommendation is likely to carry considerable weight with FERC's commissioners, according to energy analysts. Earlier this year, FERC tentatively ordered $125 million in refunds for the first three months of this year, an amount that <NAME/> called far too low.  Facing increasing political pressure from Congress, FERC -- with two new members appointed by President Bush -- has taken a harder line on California 's power prices. Last month, the commissioners imposed price restraints on wholesale power transactions in California and 10 other western states. Wagner patterned his formula after FERC's ruling last month.  The nation's wealthiest state has been battered by an extraordinary surge in electricity and gas prices that have pushed its electricity costs up from $7 billion in 1999 to an estimated $27 billion last year. Power prices did not retreat from record levels until last month.  <NAME/>'s top aides quickly claimed vindication yesterday.  "We think the numbers, even using the judge's formula, are going to be in the multiple billions," said <NAME/> Kahn, chairman of the California Independent System Operator, the state's power grid manager.  Kahn noted that the state refused to drop a growing list of legal claims against the principal energy suppliers, most of them headquartered outside the state. The companies had insisted on being released from the state's legal claims as part of any settlement, according to sources close to the negotiations.  "We will have a viable claim in state court and other jurisdictions for the remainder," Kahn said. " California will get its $8.9 billion."  But the state's own expert witness, economist <NAME/> Hildebrandt, chief market monitor for the California grid, testified before Wagner that the out-of-state generators and other nonpublic power suppliers would owe about $3.7 billion using FERC's pricing formula of last month -- less than half the $8.9 billion goal.  <NAME/> Energy is "very pleased'' by Wagner's action, said <NAME/> Bailey, vice president and general counsel of the <NAME/>-based company. The generators, however, repeated their claims that <NAME/> is trying to make them scapegoats for the state's failed electricity deregulation plan.  The major generators, in a statement yesterday, said they had delivered only 20 million megawatt hours out of the 145 million the state power grid used from October 2000 to last May. (A megawatt supplies enough power for about 750 homes.)  California utilities and municipal power companies also reaped large profits, the generators said.  "The refunds sought by California would send a profoundly counterproductive message to suppliers: when prices are low and surpluses exist, you face a steep downside; when scarcity develops and prices rise we will take away all upside [profit]. No one will invest [in California power facilities] in that climate," the generators' statement said. "The power supply shortage thus will continue without relief."   http://www.washingtonpost.com  Contact: http://www.washingtonpost.com            Economy   California and Energy Companies Miss Deadline By <NAME/> B. Schmitt    07/10/2001  The Wall Street Journal  Page A2  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  WASHINGTON -- State officials and power-company executives failed to meet a federal deadline for settling $8.9 billion of disputed California electricity charges, as a federal mediator overseeing the talks suggested the state's demand was excessive.  Cautioning that he hadn't done formal calculations, <NAME/> L. Wagner Jr., the chief administrative law judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, put the level of potential refunds at "hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe a billion dollars." He also said any sums due the state could well be offset by monies its insolvent utilities owe in unpaid power bills.  Mr. Wagner said he would recommend to the commission that any refunds be calculated only from October -- the state had been seeking rebates calculated from May 2000 -- in line with an earlier FERC jurisdictional ruling. That decision alone would shave $3 billion from the $8.9 billion claim.  Mr. Wagner, who is expected to issue formal findings in the next few days, said he would recommend that the FERC hold an evidentiary hearing to assess the correct method for figuring refunds.  The collapse of the talks doesn't preclude individual deals later between energy companies and the state, which has accused them of overcharging for power during the past two years. Yesterday, some industry lawyers indicated a willingness to keep bargaining, and Mr. Wagner said two "partial" settlements were in the works.  Yet, absent any such solution, the overcharge issue -- a flash point in the California power crisis -- is apt to be resolved in protracted legal and regulatory proceedings, which could drag on for months or even years.  The negotiations began June 25, with a deadline set for midnight last night. But late yesterday, participants indicated they were billions of dollars apart, with basic differences over everything from the disputed charges to doubts about whether the FERC, which ordered the talks, could enforce a deal because of the industry's questions about the reach of the agency's authority.  "We haven't reached a settlement. We really haven't come close," said <NAME/> Stout a senior vice president of Reliant Energy Inc.'s wholesale-power group. Reliant had offered to pay California about $50 million to extricate itself from the fight. That is more than a third of the <NAME/> company's operating profit during the relevant period, he said, although far shy of the more than $375 million California sought from Reliant.  Mr. Wagner said the industry offered a total of $716 million to settle the matter.  The refund issue is fast becoming a test of the agency's authority and credibility. The FERC, a onetime regulatory backwater, has come under intense scrutiny of late for its largely hands-off monitoring of deregulated California markets. The commission has ordered some companies to pay refunds, but they have been relatively small -- such as a $124 million rebate covering wholesale electricity bills in California in January and February.  California Gov. Gray <NAME/> has said he hopes two new FERC members will take a much more aggressive tack. The agency is expected to act quickly on the judge's call for a hearing and other findings.  Yesterday, <NAME/> Kahn, a San <NAME/> lawyer representing Gov. <NAME/> at the settlement, declared he was "gratified" by Mr. Wagner's findings, saying they validated the state's claims to some refunds, a concept the industry had rejected at the talks' outset. "We've had a ringing endorsement of the idea of refunds and we'll get back lots of money," he said, adding that what the state doesn't recoup via the FERC it will pursue in court.  But power generators, who derided the state's request for a huge refund as "ludicrous" and "unsound," felt vindicated by yesterday's proceedings. "The state came away with far less than its expectations," said <NAME/> Loeffler, an attorney for a unit of AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. "The common expectation now is that any refunds will be way below this $9 billion."

<NAME/>:

Before any brokerage account can be opened, you need to advise the RAC group.  Please send an email to the three persons ("Cc") above explaining what accounts <NAME/> North America Corp. ("ENA") requires and the purpose of those accounts (if you have not already done so).  ENA has a brokerage agreement with Bear Stearns Compamies, Inc. but not with Bear Stearns International Limited.  ENA already has resolutions for opening brokerage accounts.

Sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you.  Things are so bad at work right now. I have nothing to do whasoever.  I get in to work around 9 am and leave around 12:30 every day.  I hope all is going well in the job search.

I saw your add/drop request for the Pats. If you want me to add the Steelers as well just let me know.

Also, you might want to practice, "Would you like to SuperSize that?"

<NAME/> <NAME/> with Carr has called to inquire about ENA financials and an <NAME/> Corp. guaranty.  From an historical perspective, it has always been my understanding that <NAME/> Corp. did not wish to provide guaranties to brokers and we have been successful in that regard with several recent exceptions.  In particular, <NAME/> Corp. provided Carr with a "comfort letter" reciting the corporate "policy of general financial responsibility and interest in seeing that subsidiaries act responsibly."  [letter dated February 16, 1999]  Such letter is no longer sufficient to satisfy Credit Agricole which owns Carr.  

Joe, I believe that <NAME/> may have already spoken with you.  I don't know if your conversation included discussion of a guaranty.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.

Good Morning Honey,

I wish that I could have pulled it together enough to get up with you and take care of you this morning, I really missed that.  Thank you for waking me up and giving me kisses and love. It was a sweet way to start the day.

Today there is a meeting from UBS, in about 10 minutes. I wonder what will be said. I will let you know everything.

On the way to work I was thinking about us planning for our home. I love the sound of our home. I hated seeing all of your stuff packed away today, I like snuggling with your pillows when you have gone to work. Soon we will both just be home.

Hopefully I will be all done with my bullshit in time to meet you at the grotto before going to Stanfords, but if not I will meet you there at 6. If I make it to the grotto by 5, will that be enough time for you to pick them up as well?

I am calling the doctor when his office opens to complain about the medication. I hope he gives me some more meds, but he might tell me just to hang in there until the new lower level is stabilized.

Last night was wonderful, each time we are together I find something new to enjoy. I love being with you, holding you and feeling all of your touches and caresses. You make me so happy, and I want to make you happy. I love that little grin on your face and the tenderness in your eyes. You are a wonderful man and I am the luckiest woman in the world to have you in my life.

I love you,

<NAME/>

Your recent voice mail message to me indicated that you maintain a list of board positions held by VP's and above.  I thought that it might be helpful to have this in writing to add to your list.  Beginning with a fiscal year that starts April 2001, I am now a member of the Board and President-Elect of National <NAME/> League, a mother-daughter community volunteer organization. 

We have over 300 members, including mothers and their daughters in grades 7 through 12, in the Spring/Champions area.  We run bingo games in local nursing homes, provide "coaching" during practices for Special Olympics volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc.  It is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a focus on others, at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only on themselves.  The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment.

If you can think of a project that will be an improvement, please add it.  If you add a project, put an expected completion date and then put the date it was completed.

The list of proposed Netco employees that <NAME/> Fitzpatrick provided to me at your request included tabs for Weather and Crude.  Do you contemplate that Netco would trade those commodities/products?  <NAME/> Hall's team that he has assembled for Netco does not include anyone with either Weather or Crude operations experience.  

We retained two top-notch operations individuals - <NAME/> Hall and <NAME/> Sweeney - who at this time are not on the list for Netco.  Both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations - documentation, risk books and settlements.  <NAME/> and <NAME/> each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details.

<NAME/> has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for Weather.  Prior to has role in EGM, <NAME/> created the MPR and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio.  He also has had extensive experience in gas risk management.   

Sweeney's most recent assignment has been to manage operations for EIM.  The bulk of his <NAME/> experience has been in crude and crude products.  He was part of the original team that opened the Singapore trading office and has experience in the UK as well.  

If you anticipate dealing in commodities outside gas and power, <NAME/> and <NAME/> would both be great players to have on the Netco team.  

Let's discuss.  --<NAME/>

     I've been holding Babiuk off.  But this is starting to sound like vintage Ballentine, and I have some doubt that he has any real deal in store.  Can we sell him an option for $50,000, to accept this deal by execution of our document and payment of the consideration by November 15, 2001?  It would show that he's, at least, serious.  Or we could break off discussions with him all together and start up with El Paso.  What do you think?

OpenLink is one of the leaders in risk management systems. We used at Coral, and it was then called Abacus. It is strongest in front office risk management. I would view their competition as KioDex. The deal with <NAME/> has been around for awhile.

USA: Shares of NewPower plummet in midday trade.

10/01/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Shares of electricity provider NewPower Holdings were down almost 20 percent on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, but the company had no comment on the share drop. 
Shares of NewPower were down 55 cents, or 17.9 percent, to $2.53 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
"We don't comment on stock activity. We are reporting our earnings in November," said Gael Doar, spokeswoman for NewPower. 
NewPower, which bills itself as the first national provider of electricity and natural gas to residential and small commercial customers, recently became the outside provider with the greatest share for competitive energy providers as part of the Texas's deregulation.

I made a few adjustments to your expense estimates based on a more detail look at actuals in 2001 and my previous 2002 budget.  The total impact is to increase the budget by $68,000.  I also was not sure what your Rent, Technology and Transportation amounts were supposed to represent.  Based on our previous discussions I thought that rent and technology are covered elsewhere, but I used your numbers anyway.  I am interested in what that is supposed to be since it is not very much and those are potentially very large dollar categories if everything gets rolled in.

Call me if you have any questions.

I keep the curves very tightly controlled due to proprietary reasons.   I lose control of who has access outside my group, therefore, I have chosen to not make it available.   EOL has prices in all markets through 2003 which should be all you need to perform your analysis.

<NAME/>,

Here are the examples we talked about

Assumptions:

1.  EOL and Broker market:  COB $30 @ $40.
2.  We put out a COB/MC market $4 at $7.
3.  In EOL, Product 1 = COB and Product 2 = MC.

Here's what will happen in the broker market:

(A) If someone hits my bid of $4 in the broker market I will BUY COB at something like $35, and I will SELL Mid-C at $31.
(B) If someone lifts my offer of $7 in the broker market I will SELL COB at something like $35, and I will BUY Mid-C at $28.

If you take the same assumptions and show this market on EOL, here's my understanding of what will happen:

(C) If someone hits my bid of $4 on EOL, I will SELL COB at $35, and I will BUY MC at $39 (compare this with (A))
(D) If someone lifts my offer of $7 on EOL, I will BUY COB at $35, and I will SELL MC at $42 (compare this with (B)).

Clearly this doesn't work.

One possible solution, I think, is to examine what happens if you put out a COB/MC product on EOL, but switch the products such that Product 1 = MC and Product 2 = COB, and assume we put the underlying Product 1 market out as MC $30 @ $40.

(E)  If someone hits my bid of $4 on EOL, I will SELL MC at $35, and I will BUY COB at $39 (achieves same result as (A), which is what we want).
(F)  If someone lifts my offer of $7 on EOL, I will BUY MC at $35, and I will SELL COB at $42 (achieves the same result as (B), which is what we want).

I realize (E) and (F) don't jive with our long contract description, but conceptually it works.

If you have any questions, let me know.

<NAME/> Walters: As California's malaise deepens, Gray <NAME/>' standing plummets 



(Published Oct. 7, 2001) 

A year ago, Gray <NAME/> was riding high -- because Californians were prosperous, confident about their future and thus supportive of the political status quo. 

<NAME/>' high approval ratings had little to do with his actual performance, or any personal affection among Californians for their cool and distant governor. He was just the fortunate beneficiary of good times and good feelings. 

Today, a dark cloud has descended on the state. A sharp decline in the economy, particularly high-tech sectors, a stubborn energy crisis and, most recently, the terrorist hijackings and murderous crashes of California-bound airliners have left Californians worried about their personal safety and economic security, and they're looking for someone to blame. 

<NAME/>' approval ratings began to decline early this year as the energy crisis hit home and it became apparent that he had failed to take the initiative in heading off the worst aspects of the situation. And they have continued to sag, thus presenting the governor with a series of interlocking tests as he begins his campaign for re-election in 13 months. 

The seriousness of <NAME/>' decline was underscored late last month in a statewide Field Poll indicating that, at the moment, most California voters would prefer former Los Angeles Mayor <NAME/> Riordan to <NAME/>. History indicates that <NAME/> should still be favored to win a second term, but if Riordan does become the Republican candidate, he would have at least an outside chance of unseating <NAME/>. 

<NAME/>' chief problem is that he will be running for re-election in what will almost certainly be sharply declining economic circumstances, the product of a slowdown already under way and the plummeting consumer confidence in the wake of the terrorist hijackings. State tax revenues are in a nosedive, running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year, and <NAME/> will be compelled to make multibillion-dollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups. 

How big the state budget hole will become is anyone's guess. There's a distinct tendency for state revenues to plummet far faster and further in an economic downturn than official forecasts, just as they rise faster and higher in a recovery than the bean counters project. Some analysts believe that <NAME/>' problem could rival the $14 billion deficit that predecessor <NAME/> <NAME/> confronted in 1991. <NAME/> swallowed hard and agreed to the largest state tax increase in American history. 

However large the state's fiscal problem may be, it will be much, much larger if the state money <NAME/> spent on power purchases this year cannot be recovered from a proposed bond issue. And the $12.5 billion bond issue is on indefinite hold because the Public Utilities Commission, consumer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric are opposing the administration's demand that past and future power purchases be covered by ratepayers without review. 

It's apparent now that the long-term contracts the administration signed are much too expensive, which is why <NAME/>' own appointees to the PUC are balking. <NAME/> could try to renegotiate the contracts, but that would be admitting that he and his advisers erred in the first place. Or he could accept the Legislature's proposal, contained in legislation on his desk, that only past power purchases be guaranteed and that future contracts be subjected to the scrutiny that private utilities' purchases must receive. But <NAME/> is insisting that he'll veto the measure. 

The effect of the current flap over bonds and power contracts, as well as <NAME/>' months-long effort to provide a bailout for financially strapped Southern California <NAME/>, and his lackadaisical performance earlier in the energy game, will undermine the governor's claim for a second term. He comes across as someone who dithered when he should have acted, and signed too-expensive contracts even as the power market was contracting. That, and Californians' increasing apprehension about their future, will make his re-election a much dicier prospect than he had envisioned.

I had a conversation with <NAME/> <NAME/> and <NAME/> <NAME/> Browning this morning re: ECTRIC and the London process.

<NAME/> has generated both an in and out -of-the-money list which he will forward so that <NAME/> can review for counterparty termination accuracy.  I think that London can use our newly established processes as a template.  <NAME/> and others will participate in the 9:30 a.m. conference call Feb. 6.

<NAME/> and Bjorn:  Can you provide a <NAME/> with a copy of the "Star Gas Propane, L.P." template, or if this has been replaced, a copy of the most recent template?  Also, the "Liquidation of Price Risk Management Book" template?

<NAME/>:  Can you provide <NAME/> and <NAME/> <NAME/> with a copy of the decision tree and settlement process flowchart?

If the handouts for tomorrow will be ready and incorporate the above, the handouts are all that London will need.

hey!

sorry for the delay and thanks for thinking of me.  

i missed you at thanksgiving as well!  canadians celbrate thanksgiving
in october!?!, but some friends had me over for "american" thanksgiving,
so i had a good time anyway.  

i'm hoping to catch up with you and kt over the holidays.  i'm planning on
being on the east coast from dec 16 - jan 3, mostly in northern va.  are you
going to be in bethesda at all?  also planning a trip up to NY.  

yes, enron is in a bad way.  i'm doing fine, but it hasn't been a pleasant 
month at work with layoffs and massive uncertainty about future of the
company.  i've resolved to not worry about it until the new year and it seems
to be working!  still planning on staying in calgary but who knows?  

let me know about your holiday plans!  

love,
coop

This morning I discovered and forwarded to Teb/<NAME/> the cases of several major pipelines (Trunkline & Texas Eastern) that converted to LLC status with no protests or conditions.  These were unpublished letter orders so they don't turn up on a Westlaw search.  Teb agrees that these provide a very straight forward road map for us.

I haven't had any complaints from the post office.  In fact, we used to have a mailbox outside the gate.  It was a heavy metal box that required a key to open on a post set in cement. It was stolen (box, post, cement and all!) about three years ago and the mail carrier said that a gate key (their key does not fit any of the doors, mine or yours) was the best answer.  When I gave him the key, he put it on a huge chain with lots of keys that he uses on his route.  Has there been a problem?

On the electrician, I am going to have some work done at some point soon but am waiting for the design people to finish and suggest a good electrician -- so nothing has happened yet.  I'll keep you posted.

Winds will become northerly and northeasterly throughout the day gusty at times as well should clear out late in the afternoon....temps will be fairly low and below normal should be a high of like 72 or so on Saturday

There does appear to be some intelligence gathering going on at the CPUC.  You should speak with legal about the inquiry.  Clearly the CPUC has a right to ask anything they want - it is my understanding is that our customers have a confidentiality clause in their contract that prohibits them from responding.

I have had a request and I also think it is a good idea to put the regional gas price for the following regions.

PJM - Transco Zone 6 Non New York
NY - Transco Zone 6 New York
NEPOOL - Algonquin

The heat rates would then be calculated off the appropriate regional gas price.

Thanks for your note.  Just so you have the whole picture -- our analysis from a US law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the transactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake trades.  The offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is not blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade.  We have been handling these by using a written termination rather than a reverse trade.  This is universally the approach we have taken when our traders have agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by mistake on their part.  This happens often enough that we have given the confirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed (<NAME/> can get you a copy if you want it).  But when the counterparty refuses to let us out of a trade that is a mistake on our part, our only hope is that the mistake is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake.  Under US law when there is mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed.  In that case, the original trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind.  One alternative we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customer's "completed transactions" section as if it had never happened.  As far as I know, we have only had to do this once or twice.

Given that 1) the PUC has quite a few important issues on its agenda and 2) the PUC meeting will likely coincide with our regularly scheduled meeting time, we'll reschedule our 11:30 AM PDT call to 3 PM PDT for today only.  

With the Legislature adjourned (thankfully), we'll re-assess the need for a twice-weekly call and get back to folks.  The potential for a 3rd extraordinary session may affect what we do.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to call.

FYI.  Latest word is that Assembly, Senate and Administration staff have been locked in a room with orders not to emerge until they've struck a deal on the <NAME/> MOU.  

Word on DA is not good.  Thus far it appears that the PUC "study" outlined in the letter from <NAME/> & Co. to Lynch is as far as the Senate wants to go at this time, but folks continue to push.  Seems to be a possibility that, if the Legislature does reconvene, there may be a push by "green Senators" to pass a "green only" DA bill.

In addition, Lynch is setting the stage to have the PUC reject the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC on Tuesday.  This despite the Governor calling to vigorously lobby each of the commissioners.  Despite the strong arm tactics, it appears that Brown may be the only aye vote at this point.

The idea is that, if the PUC votes down the rate agreement, the only thing <NAME/> will have left is 18XX.  

We'll report back with news as we get it.

 I was writing to get your reaction to the judge's proposed order in the El Paso case.  You think the Commission is likely to adopt it?  Change it?  Judge's proposal fatally flawed on the market power issue?  Appreciate your insights.

The normal process is to have him interviewed by three members of the Executive Committee who then confirm that he meets our requirements for being an <NAME/> VP.  I assume you are asking us to agree to deviate from this process.  I am uncomfortable with that due to the fact that if the process is not going to be adhered to anyone can nominate a person for VP based on the strength of an individuals resume.  If everyone else agrees to the exception I won't be the one to hold this up but I don't necessarily agree with the exception being granted.

Can you also include how much this information would cost?

Hello, glad to hear you are well.  This all depends on who owns the domain name.  If it is <NAME/> Europe we need to forward all inquiries to Price Waterhouse - this is important as <NAME/> Europe is no longer part of <NAME/> and the administrator has all legal claim to the name.  I have no idea what happened to the sale of <NAME/>Direct and who now owns it.  I would suggest ringing London and asking to talk to someone from Price Waterhouse managing <NAME/> Direct.

Hi Mom,

I am amazed at those bear photos.  The entire office (what's left anyway) was around my desk looking at that.  That guy must have filled his drawers!

How is <NAME/> doing?  What shot do they think she reacted to?  I can't imagine how frightening that must have been for <NAME/> and Jackie and the whole family.

<NAME/> is staying at <NAME/> and <NAME/>'s for the weekend, I asked him to go or let me know if he wanted to stay and I would go somewhere. I need some space and he is still so upset that my presence is not helping. It would be easier on him if I just moved out now.  I can't because he can't afford to live in the house without me, and he can't leave because you can't get an apartment in this town without a job. We will be putting the house on the market no later than the first week of January.


I love you, thank you for your love and support for both of us during this very difficult time.

I think there is a real possibility here.  It would be extremely challenging commercially.

How do we convince customers to participate?
Two distinct areas:  (i) Existing portfolio of business and (ii) New business.

New business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money, who would say no to a AAA credit?  Still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present, separating them out as not netting with new trades.

Existing business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money -- they will want the improved credit.  But how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate?  This seem to me to be the biggest hurdle.


Issues:

Requires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts.
	Adequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate?
	Might make more sense where no current positions exist.
	
Contract hurdles:

	Need to allow for termination by defaulting party so <NAME/> (VMAC) will be able to control termination on default.
	Need the consent of counterparty to assign contract to VMAC.
	May require changing permitted credit support from counterparties (letters of credit probably don't work).

If we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure, an initial chunk of money will have to be given to VMAC to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio - how much is it and do we have that money?

It's not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties.  That is, if we have given an aggregate $200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate $100 million credit line to in the money counterparties, will VMAC be satisfied with the mismatch.  <NAME/> we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers?  If we go to 100% collateral requirements for all participating transactions, this is solved since there can't be a mismatch.  (<NAME/> customers agree to 100% collateral requirements - i.e. no credit lines?)

Once the supported/participating portfolio is out of the money, <NAME/> will have to post collateral to VMAC.  If we fail, VMAC can default all participating/supported contracts.  

When all of the contracts are terminated with <NAME/> as the defaulting party, the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market.  Presumably VMAC will require some cushion to cover this.

We just successfully bought out of the 02 OPPD capacity and energy obligation.   Therefore, we don't need to proceed with the diesel installation.

I have instructed <NAME/> to make your group whole on any costs incurred pursuing the diesel development in Nebraska.

In addition, I would like to pursue an 02 LM6000 project inside Ameren (approx. 100-150 MW).   This would be a strategic asset to create a control area around and utilize the flexible interconnections Ameren has with multiple systems.   We also have significant retail load obligations behind IP and Ameren in Illinois.

<NAME/> devises new borrowing plan 
His executive order could speed up $12.5 billion in bond sales and bypass PUC oversight of repayment mechanism. 
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray <NAME/> is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis. 
The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged <NAME/> last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan. 
With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis. 
"That is one scenario," <NAME/> spokeswoman <NAME/> McLean said Wednesday when asked about the proposal. "There are a number of different scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced." 
Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before they could be marketed to investors. 
<NAME/> wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes. 
The PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to the <NAME/>-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue. 
The PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that authority. It rejected the <NAME/> plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its president, <NAME/> appointee <NAME/> Lynch. 
<NAME/> earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market. 
The plan now under review, however, would bypass that. 
The DWR would not directly set rates, but under the <NAME/> plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers' utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect, guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street. 
The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes. 
Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations, but questioned whether <NAME/> had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates. 
"I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great," Lynch said. "But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of those two things." 
The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the payback plan. By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by Senate Leader <NAME/> <NAME/>, D-San <NAME/>. 
<NAME/> opposes <NAME/>'s bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers. The power companies' contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority, which <NAME/> believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute. 
If <NAME/> signs the order soon, the bonds could go to market early next year. Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion shortfall in other income.

stephanie, I know that <NAME/> McMicheal has appointed someone from the estate to start to consolidate all of our transportation positions ( if any remain ) and also our obligaitons.  I will confirm his name and from here on in, you may be asked only to assist, not lead these discussions.  However, for the purposes of PGT ( at this time ), I would ask that you continue on your path of resolution. 
 
I will follow up with Canada this a.m. to ascertain what they have done with the NOVA and ANG portions.

I got a call from Rome's lawyer, who wants to call the whole thing off because he doesn't think he'll get the money he wants.  I told him we were ready and willing to proceed.  He was going to call the mediator to see if he could cancel without incurring the mediation fees.  So, I'll keep you posted.  <NAME/>

Hi Dot,

Well, we've been talking about Italy again.  We are looking at leaving late May, like Friday, May 24 (so we can scoop in Memorial Day) and returning to <NAME/> on Sunday, June 9.  We are pricing fares now.  Continental has them posted on their website at $1,100-$1,200.  I will also check with Alliance Travel Agency (formerly Travel Agency in the Park) to see what they may be able to do for us.

Can you and <NAME/> swing these dates?

Let me know.

From my perspective the Waha, Exxon <NAME/> Tailgate and the new Carthage Tailgate product should be converted to ENA on the 18th if we find out that the close will occur June 1st.  Since the bidweek procedures we are proposing include AEP directing HPL activities for June during bidweek if we determine that close will occur June 1st, then it seems only logical that we should start operating as ENA at the same time.

i don't have a problem with that.  The 3 factors I ask in releasing info are:

	1. Do customers even know the info is available or useful?
	2. Is the info publicly available?
	3. Is the info easily obtainable?

	In this case, the answer is yes to all three, so I don't care.  If the answer is no to one or more of the above, a judgment call has to be made.

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with <NAME/> and coordinate any early afternoon departures with <NAME/> and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

State lowers estimate of energy costs 
Consumers might see rates decrease 
<NAME/> Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau <mailto:lgledhill@sfchronicle.com>
Saturday, October 20, 2001 
?2001 San <NAME/> Chronicle 

URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/10/20/MN39027.DTL>

Sacramento -- The state lowered its estimate yesterday of how much it will cost to buy power -- suggesting that lower rates could eventually be the result. 

Officials of the Department of Water Resources said the state will need $17. 2 billion to buy power through the end of 2002 -- about 20 percent less than previously estimated. 

The agency began buying power on Jan. 17 when the state's three investor- owned utilities were no longer considered credit-worthy. At the time, prices on the spot market reached upwards of $450 a megawatt hour. Now, however, prices average $30 a megawatt hour. 

"Circumstances have changed," said <NAME/> Nichols of Navigant Consulting, which is a consultant to the Department of Water Resources. "Conservation has helped, we think the DWR contracts have established reliability in the market. We have broken the back of the spot market." 

Earlier this year, the state signed 56 long-term contracts with various generators to purchase power. Those contracts, which were inked when prices were at their peak, have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the PUC, 

and Gov. Gray <NAME/>' administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts. 

But the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day. The rest comes from the spot market -- purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed. Prices on the spot market have dropped, in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive. 

It is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs. If the projections hold, the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue $12.5 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases. 

At the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs, they blasted the state Public Utilities Commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers $8 billion. 

Administration officials and state Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides said a PUC decision to delay the suspension of direct access -- the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power -- will shift higher costs to smaller customers. 

The PUC proposed the ban on direct access in June but didn't adopt the policy until Sept. 20. During that period, the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 2 percent to 13 percent. 

"What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis," Angelides said yesterday. 

He urged the PUC to reverse its decision, setting the date back to July 1. 

But Lorretta Lynch, president of the PUC, said the delay was at the request of the administration and the Legislature. 

She also objected to Angelides' numbers, saying that the PUC estimates the direct access load at 8 percent. The commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to July 1, and action will be taken at the next PUC meeting, she said.

The blending vs. non-blending can be confusing and could potentially cause problems down the road so I would first like to make some general statements regarding the history or this change and what the rules should be as I understand them.  

	Only the curves applicable to the East NERC regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility; therefore, no blending is needed for daily options (they point directly to the daily vols) or monthly options (they point directly to the monthly vol).  All curves applicable to the West NERC regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly; therefore, blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily options.

	The best rules to be in place for the blending vs. non-blending would be based on curve.  East curves do not blend.  West curves do blend.  Therefore, ANY daily or monthly option in the East would not have to blend.  The potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that, for example, the East portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a West region (curve) and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the East portfolio.

	Options at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem.  Are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration?  We still need to discuss this.

	I would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the current rules.  Let me know.

<NAME/>,

I understand you spoke to <NAME/> <NAME/> about the consent and assignment documents.  Maybe the attorneys can work this out faster than we have.  

I spoke to the city this morning and the final bills are to be mailed out today.  So I should have an amount on Wednesday.  I will email and fax the amount and the supporting bills as soon as possible.  Maybe we can close out the release this week and consent to the assignment pending 1st lien holder approval.

I have a favor to ask you.  I received the check from <NAME/> that was due May 20th.  However, I have misplaced it.  Can you ask her to put a stop on her 1st check and send me another (net of any costs for the stop payment).   If you would prefer for me to call her myself, I will.  It seems that communicating through you is working well. 

Thanks for all your help.

As most of you know, NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut (UI's territory) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC.   The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago.   The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a "bargain price" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT.
 
Over the past 2-3 years, the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "puked" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000.   At a minimum, it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies.
 
My strong view is that, as a practical matter, the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT.   The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect.   The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area.   In a true "locational marginal price" environment, the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York   Currently, pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads, regardless of who causes the congestion.   
 
In the recently proposed "single NE RTO" model, it is about 80% certain that the PJM "locational marginal price" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004.   At that point in time, consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL (in-city Boston and CT) will be exposed to higher energy prices, while consumers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island should see lower prices.
 
Given the facts above, coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets, I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "node".   
 
If we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades, the resulting "all-in" (depr, fixed & variable O&M, fuel costs, NOx, SO2, capital reserve, interest) 7x24 plant cost would be approx. $34-36/Mwh.    This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve.   Additional upside is derived from positive basis, ICAP, ancillary services, emissions allowances, and long term requirements sales to LSE's.

thanks.  I think "hump day" is putting it mildly.  You see in the press that we approached (are still approaching?) KKR?  And that Buffet ain't interested?  What a world.

A.  <NAME/>Online has been a extremely successful e-Commerce project in the energy industry.  As of September 14, 2001, it has completed over 1.4 million transactions worth $800 billion.  Currently, 60% of <NAME/>'s transactions are done via <NAME/>Online and the company's transaction costs have been reduced by 75%.    

Our business model for leveraging the internet has proved invaluable and is inherently strong.  We built EnronOnline in collaboration with input from commercial as well as technological experts.  Over the past 22 months, we have successfully the EnronOnline e-commerce platform to:  

1) Access new markets and customers
In addition to enhancing its Natural Gas and Power businesses, <NAME/>Online has enabled <NAME/> to get into other markets, for example, broadband, paper, freight, metals, weather, petrochemicals, and even financial instruments from all over the world.  The system has been instrumental in reaching many more customers than previously possible via telephone or face-to-face meetings.  

2) Manage high volume of products and transactions
<NAME/> does more than 5,000 online transactions in an average day.  Before <NAME/>Online, a buyer might have needed to make numerous phone calls to hunt down prices; now s/he can go to <NAME/>Online and instantly buy or sell a commodity at a market-driven price, with no transaction fee.  The easier price discovery attracts more companies to <NAME/>Online.  More trading builds liquidity and more liquidity tends to narrow bid and offer spreads, resulting in better prices and more deals for <NAME/>.

To paraphrase Smart Business (September 2001), a long-term gas contract, that in 1981 took two years to execute, and in 1997 took two weeks - now takes less than a second online [thanks in part, to <NAME/>Online].  Because of the technology and software <NAME/>Online has developed, it is relatively easy for <NAME/> to add new products to trade online, further making it easier to move into new markets without having to wait for long lead-times required to develop new systems.
 
3) Improve Competitive Position And Bottom Line

<NAME/>Online has truly differentiated itself in the industry by using the internet effectively.  The results have been widely reported in the media.  Internet Week (October 2000): "<NAME/> is a company that fundamentally transformed itself on the Internet - having whipped its existing businesses into online ones, ridden the Net into many new markets, added $60 billion in revenue last fiscal year, and has beaten Wall Street earnings forecasts in the first two quarters of this year . . . [<NAME/>'s] second quarter net income rose 40% from the year-earlier quarter to $404 Million, on 196 percent higher revenue of $50 billion . . . the Internet trading marketplace <NAME/> launched in late 1999 is allowing the company to pounce on market conditions with startling efficiency. <NAME/>Online now does more than $4 billion a day in trades, in everything from coal and steel to storage services and weather derivatives. 

<NAME/> was praised in Smart Business magazine (September 2001) as No. 1 of the "Smart Business Fifty" list for successfully embracing the Net to expand and enhance the business.  

Forrester Research (Forrester Report April 2001) predicts online energy trading will explode from a $400 billion market in 2000 (with <NAME/>Online dominating most of the wholesale energy trades), to $3.6 trillion in 2005.  <NAME/> leads the field with double the online trading volume of its nearest competitor.

I need help determining how much margin the short options require.  My account has a value of around $1,400,000.  That includes 750,000 of us treasury notes.  I am ready to build a bond ladder of muni's.  I need to know how much I can purchase with the funds in this account.  Obviously, I don't want to margin the account to invest in fixed income.

Vin,

Glad we could hook up yesterday. 

The gist of what we are interested in is providing <NAME/>Online's liquidity to local NYMEX traders. I would like to explore the concept of NYMEX's clearing corp or another clearer standing in the middle between <NAME/> and these locals. <NAME/>Online's architecture provides for a Master user, such as a Clearing Corp, to set up as many sub-users (local traders) as it wants. Each sub-user has trading rights as designated and controlled by the master. We would envision the Clearing Corp. handling it credit arrangements with the locals, and negotiating its relationship with <NAME/>. I know this is pretty simple stuff, but every long journey starts with a small step. Please let me your interest in pursuing this sort of arrangement or a variant thereof.

Thanks,
<NAME/> Zipper

FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite DWR contracts and DA "stampede"), which should leave one to believe that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which further supports <NAME/> Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.
Best,
<NAME/>
CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed 
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible. 
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has been resolved. 
Chairman <NAME/> stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. 
<NAME/> indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as well as 400 MW generated by wind. 
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? 
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman <NAME/> and <NAME/> Doll, provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation. Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. 
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand side management, renewables and peakers. 
Power Authority Names <NAME/> <NAME/> as Chief Financial Officer 
<NAME/> <NAME/> was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. <NAME/> currently works for the City of San <NAME/>, and has worked in the past for the New York Power Authority.

whatever babe - i am concerned but not to the point of worrying my brains out - like you.  i tend to trust the doctor in matters such as these- like when i had chest pains, the doctor ran tests to rule out significant problems and did notice an abnormality on one test.  instead of running out and panicking i waited and took the tests again and they were normal.  now i am not advocated waiting for the next test if that makes you uncomfortable - you should do what you want to do. but i guess what i am saying is that YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DIE !!! so stop worrying and let the tests confirm or deny any problem....

We absolutely should do this.

We shouldn't necessarily not get paid.

There are many different type of outsourcing structures that we have used.

PetroCanada/Suncor - Milnthorp

<NAME/> Union

Peoples - <NAME/> Luce

Enerconnect - Devries

My experience have been only positive when we have been able to get very close with a customer.  Money will show up.  However, if we do operations/accounting stuff for them we should get paid.

The Management is trying hard to put on a good face forward, but they fucked this one up nicely.

McKinsey:  I read their letter - pretty good recap of where we are today.  <NAME/> Busby and I would like to meet with you regarding his assessment of market potential and internal trade-offs relative to that.  Would make most sense for the three of us to do that before having any further conversations with McKinsey.  What I know is that McKinsey can be very expensive to work with.  We would have to feel revenue opportunities would be very strong in order to commit to spend dollars with McKinsey.  


Staff Meeting Attendees:  <NAME/> <NAME/> Sommers now attend the Thursday Net Works staff meeting?  Does he know about it for this week?  Have we made any decisions on the purpose and make-up of that meeting?  We are including <NAME/>'s directs on IT, but not their counter parts in Operations.  Including operations would make that meeting too big, so I am not necessarily suggesting that.  Just trying to rationalize the meetings that we want to have.  (FYI - In Causey's staff meeting today, <NAME/> mentioned that the move of the ISC under Net Works was announced within Net Works - and spread - before Causey or <NAME/> announced this to the people in the ISC.  Creates a bit of a bumpy start.  Causey is still very much in favor of this move - he did share with me last week 3 things that he will be looking for to insure that this move is smooth and yields the results desired,.  I can share those with you.  Causey has explicitly covered the 3 items with <NAME/> in agreeing to the transition.)  

Budgets:  After meeting with Whalley last week, should we consider coming to the table as Net Works with a reduction in budgeted dollars (expense and capital) of 10% or so?  That has not been our goal to date, but maybe it should be, given the stretch that <NAME/> is trying to make.  Might also bode well with all of the business units to which we are allocating if we could say that we took a hard look and made those reductions ourselves.  I have some ideas on how we might get there.  Let me know - we would need to get that done this week.  --<NAME/>

Tell them that margin will be posted as normal, no excess nor any intraday calls.  Since ENE is flush with liquidity, he should be very comfortable that we can pay our bills.  The positions will roll off through time until the position gets very small and then we will x-pit everything out of Man and close the account.  Anything different and all dealings between Man and <NAME/> in energy will be terminated in both OTC and futures.

All:

I am trying to resolve a recurring issue in the financial power group.

In the past, we have withheld payment for all swaps with the same counterparty terminating during a calendar month until the fifth Business Day after the floating price is determinable at the end of a month.  As a practical matter, calculation of the payment of an aggregate of daily transactions would conceivably wait until the last Business Day of the month when a floating price was needed for one or more of the swaps.

How do you feel about payment for multiple trades with a party having varying termination dates throughout a given month?  Is this a cash flow issue?  Do I need to involve someone from Treasury or Settlements?

Please let me know.  Thanks.

Attached are my final comments.  They deal more with the proposal to curtail exports (including muni).  I don't really care if we file this with the material we have already put together, or do something with it separately.  With respect to the ATC and TTC questions we were addressing earlier, I haven't added anything to what <NAME/> put together.

jeff,

Is the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE  or  just above market.  If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?  If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time.  Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.

<NAME/>,

When I was approving latest expense report I noticed an item listed Gulfstream project (lunch with <NAME/> Higginbotham).  I have been working on Gulfstream OBA & interconnect agreement with Frazier/Dot/ <NAME/> for several weeks.  I didn't realize that you were working on Gulfstream items too.   What is your team working on on Gulfstream?

Also can I get a copy of the revised contract quick reference manual.  I think I had the outdated  one prior to the latest printing.

we flashed this as Union, they subsequently moved the volumes on GL to CPR pipeline exchange.  you have to look at both to get this to reconcile.  Does this make sense?  If not, give me a call.  Thanks.

FYI. 
Thought folks might be interested in the following story. 
In addition, I've attached at the end for those that are interested a CSFB report on PG&E's POR announced yesterday.
Very much enjoyed working with this group on a solution for California.  Perhaps, given were things stand, we'll have another shot at helping get the market, California energy policy, and <NAME/>, back on their feet.

FERC To Examine Alleged Market Manipulation By Calif ISO
Updated: Friday, September 21, 2001 04:53 PM ET By <NAME/> Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipulating its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.
At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state under contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The state's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has proven embarrassing for Gov. Gray <NAME/>, who signed $43 billion in deals to head off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market, according to a letter sent by <NAME/> Wolfman, lead FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.
The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resources - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend the meeting.
"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedures of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine months, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market structure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to develop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and procedures."
ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC
The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines which power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from.
If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an audit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated the market, Wolfman's office said.
"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational audit of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated."
The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest power first.
"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR power at high prices and protect Gov. <NAME/> from political embarrassment," the second letter says.
The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and declined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's meeting.
Generators Confused
Generators, including Mirant Corp. (MIR <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=3DMIR>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=3DMIR>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=3DMIR>), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=3DREI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=3DREI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=3DREI>), <NAME/> Cos. (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=3DWMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=3DWMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=3DWMB>), <NAME/> Energy (DUK <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=3DDUK>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=3DDUK>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=3DDUK>) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=3DDYN>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=3DDYN>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=3DDYN>), have bought apparently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegations, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-of-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market participants see.
DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DWR operations chief <NAME/> Garris has said, but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-term contracts.
The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to the ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hours was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computerized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than the out-of-market prices for months.
None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.
The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Calif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meeting isn't open to the public.
The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to improve the market.
"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility practices," Wolfman said in the letter.

<NAME/>,

Thanks for passing this message on -- it is good to know what is on the rumor mill, and nobody who knows what I do ever passes those on to me directly!

I believe that we should carefully stay away from any statement that cuts are based on mid-year PRC, as that would not be the best legal defense to have.   

Instead, HR, with assistance from legal, has put forth a matrix for businesses to use in determining which employees, if any, will be affected.  Listed on that matrix include factors such as job criticality (which is weighted to be twice as significant as any of the other factors), ability to perform several different types of jobs, business knowledge, leadership, teamwork, and historical performance over the last 18 months.  PRC results would not be the sole factor.  Otherwise, someone who is the only person who knows how to do a mission-critical job might be affected simply because he rated out lower at mid-year review.  That result obviously would be disasterous.

In California, all customers can choose--large and small.  There are core (small customer) and noncore (industrial customers).  Consumption volume differentiates the two.  Noncore customes receive cheaper transporation rates.I'm not sure what sort of limitations you're specifically focused on.  There are requirements regarding storage requirements (customers must have some storage) and requirements to pay a share of past "stranded costs" caused by the move to competition.  And noncore customers on PG&E have more flexibility to buy in-state transportation than customers on SoCal have.

If there's anything else, let me know.

hi jill,

ah, i don't think you'll get this until next week, but maybe you're checking your email on the road.  hope your course is fun.  

how was it to see your family.  i've had my parents visit me up here and i was also down there over christmas break and i much prefer when they visit me rather the other way around.  i feel like i'm back in high school when i'm back home, i think, or something like that.  

don't tease me, what did you do on sat night?  

work is going really well - finally feeling some pressure.  

hmm, i don't know anything about painting pottery, but i'm interested. i've done it before and its harder than it looks and takes awhile, but could be fun with the right group of people.  

talk to you soon,
cooper

The writer fails of course to mention that <NAME/> (with bi-partisan support) bombed the shit out of bin laden after the embassy attacks.  Frankly, I find any partisan activity at this juncture to be petty and deplorable.  There's a heckuvalot of people that just watched a couple of jumbo jets fly into the WTC, and a whole bunch of people without families anymore.  There's no room for politics in my view, period.  And I think partisan politics is about the very last thing that  the families of the victims are thinking about at this time.

G-P Leaf <NAME/> pulp mill sale deal with <NAME/> falls through
10/24/2001 17:43:03, Forestweb 
By <NAME/> <NAME/>  San <NAME/>, Oct. 24, 2001 (Forestweb) -- The tentative deal for <NAME/>-Pacific Corp. (G-P) to sell its Leaf <NAME/> market pulp mill to <NAME/> Corp. has collapsed, according to a knowledgeable industry source.  Neither company is speaking publicly about the latest development, citing policies against commenting on rumors. However, the pending arrangement, subject to final approval, was no secret to some pulp and paper industry players (see Forestweb, Oct.19).  Top <NAME/> officials were said to have nixed the agreement this week. Last week in its third quarter earnings statement, the company reported a net loss of $618 million, including a write-off of $1.01 billion.  The source said the deal might still be salvageable at a later date.  The Leaf <NAME/> mill, in New <NAME/>, Miss., has the capacity to produce 600,000 tonnes per year. Since February it has produced exclusively softwood kraft pulp.

Dear Little Sister,

Thank you so much for you love and support during this difficult time.  I wish that I could make this easier on everyone, but this is what has to be done.  I have no intention of separating from you or the <NAME/>/McPhersons, you all are more than family to me.  You will always be my little sister. I am going to work very hard to come through this with <NAME/> and me as much friends as possible, so that the stress to us all will be minimized.  I see no reason to hurt people over what amounts to belongings.

I am glad you liked your gifts, you did save at least one to open on Christmas day, right?  I hope so.

I have the house to myself this weekend, <NAME/> is at your folks to give us a little space.  He is still very upset, and I feel bad that I have made him so sad. I really didn't think he would be this upset. I am glad that the family is rallying support for him, and I have been kind of laying low with the family so that he can have that support. He has no real friends here, and that is a big problem.

I love you,

<NAME/>

<NAME/> responded and filled me in on the issue.  Sounds like we need the automated link to solve future problems.  How are we going to clean up the existing backlog?  Did you know that this had grown so large?  <NAME/> says that this sits in <NAME/> Stubbs' lap to solve and that he has offered up resources to help. Sounds as if the offer has not been taken by <NAME/>.  

<NAME/> is obviously out of his crisis mode on counterparty credit issues and has lifted his head to look at other things.  I hate getting these e-mails from him --he always has more info than I do on issues and for some reason his confidence level in operations is not incredibly strong because he always contacts me!  I would love for someone else on the operations team to gain his confidence and I am sure that you would like for him to come to you with issues instead of always contacting me first.  (<NAME/>'t worry - you are not alone in this -- applies to EA, EGM and EIM as well).  Let's talk about how we can manage this better.

I am planning on calling in from home.  Do we have a list of issues/states that we want EPSA to focus on?

If you send me your thoughts, I think that we can send to EPSA before the phone call.

My list -

1.	Florida Wholesale (EWG w/o CCN)
2.	AZ opposition to the APS - Pinnacle West generation "sale"
3.	Continue pushing at state level for NOx fairness in allocation to IPPs
4.	Re-instate Direct Access in California.

Many EPSA members (led by <NAME/>) will fight against direct access.  I won't push hard here.

Attachment shows where we ended up.  I really don't think it helps if we have customers read only on EOL. How does that hurt us?  It certainly helps them - I think you have a publicity nightmare too .
We should probably talk but I am more of the opinion we'll take anyone's credit now and risk reducing helps them to keep trading potentially.


AEP sent us a very threatening letter.  Way outside of their contractual rights.

Hello <NAME/>,

I was glad to hear back from you. So you are going to be a grandpa soon. That's great news!

Well, the main reason I am writing to you is that I need some advice. I would like to go back to school next year but I have no financial security. My job prospects don't look good either now that <NAME/> was bought from another company.  I know that many private schools offer scholarships as well as assistantships. I am looking into all of those. 

It would be very helpful for me if you would help and direct me in the righ direction, let's say if you know a professor that would like to have his own researcher which would help me in the process to go through with school. I have a great deal of interest in finance, and that is what I want to do, I really don't want to do a MBA, rather a MS in Finance. I am very ambitious and work really hard to succeed. I have great work experience and I have worked for a company that is well recognized for its talent pool.

If you can't help me with this process, do you know anyone who can? I really would appreciate any advice that you can give me because I have no one else to get advice from right now. In addition, if you have any contact in the job market I would look into that too. 

Thanks <NAME/>,

Here are my thoughts / issues with the EPSA paper:

1.	The EPSA paper indicates the preferred option of the 5 models that FERC Staff proposed.  Should EPSA at least indicate that it stands ready to analyze other solutions that may be proposed?  Gives EPSA an "out" of this recommendation if it proves later that FERC's application of the Delivered Price Test is unworkable.

2.	 I don't understand when EPSA says "Our recommendation, therefore entails a more stringent method of assessing market power" on page 2 of the draft?  Why should EPSA indicate that it is comfortable with a 20% Economic Capacity test to FERC.  I would argue that 35% is the minimum we should entertain as an opening position.  Also, is there a fear that a power marketer would have to meet this test in "real-time"?  Having a once and done for three year application is ok, but if we are conditioned that we can't get beyond 20% in any market, what does this do to trading and how would this be reported?

3.	  The discussion on Available Economic Capacity and its implication for having a "bias against new entry" is confusing.  Maybe we should clairfy our concerns.  

4.	The argument that ALL new generation is by definition pro-competitive needs to be strengthened.  It should be explained in the context of the Delivered Price Test.  Also, it that still true if a party which holds 100 MW in a 500 MW market builds a 100 MW power plant - now 200 MW in a 500 MW market?  Maybe I am missing something.

5.	EPSA needs to make the argument that Conditioning MBR on vague rules is wrong and anti-competitive earlier in the paper.  This is my biggest concern - that we are perpetually subject to some refund risk when the market "breaks" even though our fundamental presence has not changed.

6.	I don't understand the EPSA paper on RTO versus non-RTO markets.  EPSA endorses something but I'm not sure what?  What does this mean if I sell on TVA's network?  I appreciate blanket authority, but I wonder about exactly how this would be constructed?  Would this be similar to the natural gas marketer blanket authority?  Also, doesn't this play into the hands of the transmission monopolists who don't want competition - if they never set up an RTO they never face competition?

The desk took the adjustment and we were waiting on <NAME/> to verify the amounts on the A/R.  We need to know the variance on the A/R by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in Sitara.  The desk took a 5.7 million dollar expense PMA.  Please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in Sitara.  Until this gets done, OA will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment - we wanted to get it in for year end.

I have made reservations for <NAME/>'s Bachelor Party.  You are the chosen few.  The cruise is set for Sat. Jan 19 at 7 pm out of Freeport.  Transportation will be arranged for you.  We need to leave at about 5 pm on the 19th.  I will arrange a meeting place and relay it to you in a future e-mail.  The final tally will be $32 a person. I have paid for this already so you can reimburse me on the 19th and I can promptly blow all of that money on gambling.  Sadly, the gourmet dinner was not available on the Freeport cruise so we will have to suffer through a buffet dinner.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Would there be any interest in using the Auction functions on EOL for this product instead of a product line?  There is a lot of flexibility in setting the rules -- reserve prices or not, sale commitment or not, timing, etc. -- and you would have the added benefit of finding out where customers were willing to transact if our price was too high for them.   I assume we are only showing one side of this market.

One other thing.  I just had coffee with a former business colleague.  She is preliminary stages of starting a new, private science and tech high school (in conjunction with Cathedral in SF--Episcopalian folks).  I told her that you would be a good person to talk to w.r.t. setting up board, staff, etc.  She's very interested. She is an extremely neat person who I think you would like a lot.  Are you interested in talking to her?

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/<NAME/> merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, "it's not you <NAME/>, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new."

Hello,

Your right it has been a long time since we have chatted.  Things are a change'n with my life.

First I just got back from a little (so called) vacation where <NAME/> and I drove from West Palm Beach to <NAME/>.  We did it over 3 days so it wasn't that bad.  Day one was a 10 hour hop from West Palm to Desitn, Fl.  You would have loved <NAME/>, they have the most amazing sand on their beaches.  It kind of reminds me of Icing Sugar.  Very white and has a very fine texture, and I felt like I was sink right into the sand. www.holidayinndestin.com.  Next stop was in New Orleans, which ended up with lots of drinks and some pretty good Cajun food.  It took about 6 hrs to get there from <NAME/> but the traffic was not that bad.  Next stop was in <NAME/> (about 5.5 hrs) from New Orleans.  By now I'm sure you have asked yourself.."Why did they do this drive?"  And the obvious answer is because <NAME/> is moving there.  She rented a really nice loft in down town <NAME/> not far from <NAME/> Field http://astros.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/hou/ballpark/hou_ballpark_history.jsp.  She took a job with <NAME/> Energy Service which is our retail company.  The bad thing is I'm not sure how I feel about having her work for the same company. The good thing is that she is in a different building than the Wholesale group so the chances of having my personal life and business life cross are low.  I guess this would kind of be like if we worked for Shell and I ran the Bulk dealer ship and she was responsible for exploration.  Not the same business but none-the-less for the same company.

Second,  It look like I am going to sell my house and probably end up moving to <NAME/> as well.  Believe it or not this was not by design, just a mere coincident.  However, it has presented some tough questions.  Do I really want to move again? and Do I want to co-habitate?  Moving is the easy part, I'm starting to become an expert, and I was thinking about selling my house anyway.  As for co-habitating, the jury is still out.  <NAME/> would have no problem with the idea, but, Cold feet McKay has mixed feeling.  Co-habiation is in the lead as it stands.

Third, What would you prefer I do with some of the goodie's you have let me borrow. ie Your beautiful dolls, the cabinets the dolls are in, the TV stand, you mirror, and the other few remaining items.  I thought I would store the dolls at <NAME/>'s, but I was unsure as to what your preference was for the other things.   I am going to sell everything I can and start over in <NAME/> regardless my living plans (the only thing I'm going to try to take is my car).  If you want I can either try to get a fair price for you furniture or <NAME/> might be able to make good use of the TV Cabinet and other things.  Email me your phone number as I do not have it, and we can talk about what is best.

Anyway, good to hear you are getting some exercise (I am trying to do the same), and stay off the darts if you can.  If you cann't, reward yourself for trying!

Take care and I will talk to you in a couple of weeks.

Love,

<NAME/>

I generally agree with your approach.  We may be able to assign our contracts to a competitor and actually get paid (because of margin in contract vs. current market), particularly if competition is not pricing this risk or choosing to ignore it.   Potential candidates are Green Mountain, New Power Co, TXU, etc.

Any thoughts?

Corp Security did a quick audit today of the Gas Control Center on EB42 and made several recommendations of some 
steps we should take prior to some of the expected workforce changes next week.  

1) Tighten control of access to the Gas Control facilities
	- They recommended reducing access to a single door and posting a guard for the next week or so.
	- They recommended reviewing the card access lists for the secure doors and reducing to critical staff only.

	We have arranged for a guard beginning Monday morning. Access to Gas Control will be through the South
	hallway and door only. Exit, except for emergencies, will be limited to the South door as well. The guard
	will be checking everyones card prior to entry. 

	We have reviewed the card access lists for all secure doors and removed everyone except Gas Logistics and
	IT support staff. We have disabled access into Gas Control on all doors except the	South door.

	We have cancelled all scheduled meetings and presentations scheduled for the Gas Control Presentation
	Center (EB42C1). 

2) Isolate the Gas Control Network environment - disconnect our network from the Corporate backbone 
	
	We DO NOT intend to Isolate Gas Control until events dictate that we should. We are taking steps to be prepared 
	to isolate, while minimizing the impact to the Gas Control SCADA system, the TMS system, and PGAS. 
	
On Monday we will also configure the Hangar to support temporary operation of the Gas Control and other Gas Logistics
business functions. Two conference rooms and the break room will be configured with phones, network connections, 
and workstations. They will be configured to support up to 60 staff. The minimum staffing requirements for the Hangar to
support the Gas Control and Gas Logistics functions,as currently defined, is 35 staff. The Hangar will be left configured
for approximately two weeks, depending on events.

Last update that I know about for CDWR costs.  If <NAME/> or <NAME/> know of later $ figures, please advise <NAME/>.  Also, my understanding was that the CPUC simply disallowed the CDWR from having straight passthru without review.  They may get to charge 100% of these dollars, but needs CPUC approval.

We have decided to name our books FB-West1 thru 10......for each region

We will have a matrix saved for everyone to be able to look at with the book names, trader names, sitara books, P&L file name, global id, and everything else that anyone might want to see.  I think this will make things more consistent than coming up with new stupid names like before.  All books, including the financial books, will have the same portfolio and book codes.  Physical books will be seperate but will all be the same.

Please review the attached agreement for the Big Sandy Interconnect.  It is very standard.  It is reimbursable.  It has a few blanks that have to be filled in for certain dates that we (or Caithness) don't know just at this time with respect to receiving regulatory approval, in-service date, etc.  Caithness wants this agreement for their prospective equity partners to review for content.  

Teb, Lee and <NAME/>, this agreement has not changed since you have last seen it, but I just wanted you to give it one more look.

Sorry I missed your call last night.  I had a good cry and went to bed early.  
 
As you noted in your voice message, I am planning to travel by myself on Saturday, Dec 15.  It is the only time I can get a confirmed flight (albeit a more cumbersome route and more expensive).  
 
Here is the other part of my plans.  I feel fairly sure that I will return to the US immediately after my court date, unless the stay requirements are very, very short.  I can fathom the courage to travel by myself, but not to hang around 2 weeks by myself.  Also, all these constant changes have put a serious strain on what is already a very tedious work situation for me.
 
I am still planning to have Connie move forward with getting <NAME/> a letter of invitation /VISAs -- including a Russian VISA that is good until Mid-January.  That way <NAME/> can return for <NAME/> after the first of the year if necessary.  Please ask Sergei to look into possible arrangements.  I would be happy to pay for Sergei and Larisa to have a holiday in Moscow if they were willing to fly with <NAME/> there.  Perhaps she could stay at the orphanage or with a host family and have an orphanage worker take her to Almaty.  
 
I am totally terrified about traveling by myself  -- but this isn't a fear that will ease with time.  I feel like I just have to dive in or I am going to change my mind.
 
I need some reassurance on what happens at the airport.  <NAME/> the assistance service help me at customs?  <NAME/> Sergei pick me up and where will I find him?  Do I have hotel accomodations (if so preferrably at the Hyatt)?
 
Obviously I am also handling a mountain of guilt about leaving without <NAME/>.  I wrote her a note about my current thoughts on travel and why I am leaning towards leaving on Sat.

Retroactivity (July 1)
No contract renewal
No incremental "DASR'ing", i.e., adding/subtracting load on the margin (fast food chains, for example)
Cost allocation risk (e.g., IOU undercollection, bonds, DWR undercollection gets distributed to DA customers)


Before providing elaborate descriptions, wanted to try to get a complete list of the key risk areas.  Please add to/subtract from this list, and then I'll take a shot at fleshing it out.

Glad to hear their attorney contacted you.  I agree that we will not consent to the assignment unless the release and utility issue are resolved, but I would prefer to get the utility and release resolved without waiting for the 1st lienholder to consent.  Can we wrap up those issues and sign some sort of agreement to consent subject to Southern Pacific Bank's consent.

I don't see you on MSN, but I am on the phone now with <NAME/> and she is having back problems (a long story, I'll share later), but we are going to have to cancel the lake this weekend.  I have a 10:00 meeting, so I will have to run soon.  I'll call you when I get back.

I'm still OK taking off tomorrow and next week.  Maybe we stay home this weekend to be with <NAME/>, and if he is better, then we can take him to my mom's on Mon or Tue and go on to the Hyatt Hill Country next week.


Thoughts?

I am very interested in what the wholesale customers have to say about our issues.  Do they have a mandate to not trade, are they wanting to turn down their exposures etc. If any customers say this, then let me know.

We held a meeting to discuss the status of TW's 637 Imbalance filing.  Our current position (after discussions about a month ago) has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stir-up segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie.  We discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our OBA "wish list" outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 637 filing.

After further discussion we decided that the one thing, most narrowly defined, that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cash-out in constrained areas.  If defined this narrowly, this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data.  We think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 637 filing.

<NAME/> & <NAME/> are going to discuss with MKM and Teb with <NAME/>.  Lyn & Terry are going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe (<NAME/> to Blanco, Blanco to Thoreau, Thoreau to the border & check with <NAME/> for any other areas that should be included) and increased imbalance levels.  We plan to get together next week to discuss further.

Concerning the rest of our OBA "wish list", we are discussing whether to hold meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the Imbalance issues of the filing and work toward a "settlement" position on those issues to have ready in the event of Commission action in this docket.

Couldn't another explanation be that the Board DID UNDERSTAND the partnership transactions and were comfortable with the deals once the Chinese Walls and protections were put in place?

I don't believe the Board members would shirk their responsibilities (as you pointed out, most of the members have more than the average expertise to understand the transactions) if for no other reason than not taking the chance in possibly sullying their individual reputations by not properly vetting the deals.

This is very sad.  Prentice (now one of PWC's finest) and I talked and here's where I come out.  I love <NAME/> and want to remember her the way she is.  And I bet she would feel the same way.  All the chemo gets her is a little more time, and who knows how long, and the quality of extended life is likely to be very low.  It's really hard, but I think that the best thing for <NAME/>, and everyone else, is for <NAME/> to go to sleep, peacefully and quietly.  I hope you don't mind, but I'd like to pass on the 6 o'clock phone call.  I hope you understand.  I'll be at your place on Thursday to see her.

Further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of. The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  

Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. 

In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by <NAME/> Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.

I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..

Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.

I agree with this approach and I'm fine with this allocation.   My objective is to get everything as accurate as possible so the proper price signal is being sent to retail and wholesale origination.   I caught the scalar issue when we were looking at 4 hour tolls vs. 8 hour tolls vs. 16 hour and I could tell there was a disconnect.

thanks.

1.   don't know.  some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent.  some will not come back at the same prices it went off.  residential conservation i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back as prices fall.  as far as switching i dont think #2 is the floor some people think it is.  maybe #6 is the floor.
2.  you know my outlook for xh,  with slightly above normal weather jan goes out at 2.75 and that is not constrained by a #6 floor.  next jv, too far away to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a $2.50-3.50 commodity.  
3. the obvious
4. yes.  believe if we end at 2.6 in the ground, the current nymex forward curve may be fairly priced.  my belief is that at the current prices we will end up with much more than 2.6 and that $5 is not value if we have 2.8 in the ground and gaining y on y.  circular argument that leads to my belief that prices must fall.
5.  not necessarily.  will loss of demand with normal weather cancel the fact that there will be much less demand destruction.  probably.

<NAME/>, 

Here are the procedures for the East.  The West is not currently running option sensitivities. 

Approximately every one to two weeks or as requested by the options traders an option sensitivity report is run using PortCalc.  Three parameters are tested:  Price (increments from -5 to +5), monthly Volatility (increments from -25% to +25%), and Time (increments up to 90 days.  (Reminder:  the increments are changeable)  The data is imported from PortCalc into an Excel pivot table.  The pivot table is then used to show how the various Greeks (delta, gamma, theta and Vega) change for each trader's book, generally with a 3 month look ahead.  The data can also be sorted by and grouped by other criteria, if requested, such as by region and delivery date These reports are given to the East option traders only.

Help Joe -- what is this about?  Is there some possibility of the FERC curbing our ability to use OFOs?  This is an absolutely critical tool for us to keep -- even though we seldom use.  Where/when can we make our case.

Extraordinary (Special) Session Rules and Procedures
Call of Special Session: 
Only the Governor has the authority to convene a special session of the Legislature. In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon. 
Election of Special Session Officers, Committees and <NAME/> Referrals: 
The election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees. 
Identification of Special Session Bills and Publications: 
Separate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper. 
Introduction of Special Session Bills: 
There is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session. 
Special Session <NAME/> Procedures and Calendars: 
There is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the "30-day in print" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session. 
Effective Date of Special Session Legislation: 
Simple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature. 
End of Special Session: 
Only the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session. The concurrent resolution takes effect upon passage by both houses of the Legislature, and is not subject to a Governor's signature or veto.

I think the only other solution is to post two curves, one with an SP and one with PR.  You should be able to simply set up the same curves as risk type PR and have it look to the SP curve.   Then you would publish two curves with the exact same name and value, just two different risk types.  The only other option I see is to change the deals back to the "old" aeco curve that we used prior to this.

I don't know if <NAME/> has responded to your request yet concerning what contracts are expiring with WTX Pool capacity and about that <NAME/> contract you mentioned in our Staff Mtg yesterday, but I looked at my notes and this is what I come up with.

The <NAME/> contract that expires 7/31/2002 without ROFR is already taken into consideration as expired in the November, 2002 capacity of 17,300/d we derived last week (which we've already sold 20,000/d to Calpine & PPL).

Other contracts expiring in 2002 & early 2003 from the WTX Pool are:

	25841	PG&E	17,200/d	10/31/2002	(ROFR trigger 10/31/01)
	26511	PG&E	  8,165/d	10/31/2002	(ROFR trigger 10/31/01)
	Total		25,365/d

	26683	APS	8,000/d		3/31/2003	(subject to ROFR)
		
Otherwise, we have WTX Pool capacity every Apr-Oct of 14,000/d (opposite of SWG's seasonal ctrc).

The other issue we could take into consideration here is displacement.  For the month of November, 2002 (for example) we have 22,000/d of capacity we are including in our WT-1 total that is made up of southward paths (20,000/d for USGT & 2,000/d for Astra with receipts north of WT-1 for delivery to WTX delivery points south of WT-2).  This is the most conservative capacity reservation policy.  In the event not enought physical receipts were nominated south of WT-1 to fulfill all physical deliveries nominated south of WT-1, we would need to compress gas south through WT-1 to make deliveries for these two contracts.  We may want to reassess this.

<NAME/>,

You asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance.  

The bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as follows:

	"Provided that <NAME/> meets its earnings targets and provided that Employee is rated within the top 25% of the performance criteria under <NAME/>'s annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question, Employee's annual bonus amounts under the Plan for calendar years 2001, 2002, and 2003 (payable in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively), shall be based on an annual bonus target of $_____________."

This language does not address a person's performance as compared to one's peers, but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25% of those criteria.  Thus, if there are only 3 rating categories (i.e., 1, 2, 3, distributed as 10-80-10), then only the people in the top category would be within the top 25/33% of the rating criteria.  

Given the huge change in our process, however, there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead, we should look at the top 25% of the peer group, instead of performance criteria, even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was drafted.

As a result, I would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories (i.e., 2A, 2B, or 2C).  That way, persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2A would be eligible for the target bonus.  If there is a decision not to break  down the middle 80 further, then it would be useful to look at those employees with a bonus target that we think is too high. For those employees, a more conservative approach may be to evaluate them on a scale that is more subdivided than the 10-80-10 breakdown and to document that they fell out in the bottom 75% of the categories under that process.  

Of course, it goes without saying that we should ensure consistent treatment based on race, sex, national origin, age, etc. in this process.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

12:24 16Aug2001 RSF-Canada blisters under "year with too much summer"

    By Kanina Holmes
    WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Canadians, sometimes divided by regional differences, economic disparities or linguistic snits, find themselves united this summer by an uncomfortable phenomenon -- a national drought.
    From Atlantic to Pacific, from the Arctic to the U.S. border, most of the world's second-largest country has been sweating through weeks of blistering heat that experts say could end up being the worst drought in decades.
    "In many ways, this drought is the same tune that's being played right across the country. It's a different look, different season and different impact, but nevertheless, everybody has a water shortage problem in many parts of the country," said <NAME/> Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment Canada.
    Whether it's fires raging in the forests of British Columbia and Quebec, barren Prairie plains or harsh restrictions on water usage in Ontario, many will remember the summer of 2001.
    "It'll be memorable for the wrong reasons I think. Too much excess and not enough normal," said Phillips.
    In parts of British Columbia, water management officials say the tinderbox conditions are largely the result of last winter's record low snowfall in the mountains.
    "We've had normal summer in terms of rain. But we knew back in March with the low snowpack that if we had a normal summer we were going to be in trouble," said <NAME/> Mattison, Water Management Director for B.C's Bureau of Sustainable Resources.
    But the devastation is most apparent in Canada's breadbasket, the Prairies. Many farmers, especially in southern <NAME/> and Saskatchewan, have already written off their crops.
    "I've been here since '63. I have never in my life, ever, seen anything like this," <NAME/> Stienwand, a farmer in Castor, <NAME/>, told Reuters.
    "IT'S BEYOND YOUR IMAGINATION"
    "There's no water. The grasshoppers are so bad. It's beyond your imagination," said Stienwand who farms 1,080 hectares (2,700 acres) of grains and oilseeds and also raises beef cattle.
    It has been so sweltering in his region, located about 160 km (100 miles) west of the Saskatchewan border, that some of Stienwand's farm machinery caught fire this week as he tried to bale a meager barley crop into hay for his livestock.
    "It's just going to destroy a lot of farmers. They're just not going to come out of it," he said.
    In June, the <NAME/> government declared a drought disaster to trigger emergency aid to livestock farmers struggling to feed and water their herds, and, as many of the withered and patchy crops are harvested, many analysts are already anticipating sharp reductions in yields and quality.
    Last week, the Canadian Wheat Board, the marketer of western Canada's wheat, durum and barley crops, forecast a 10 to 15 percent decline in exports.
    In Ontario, Canada's most populous province, prime agricultural areas have received only about 15 percent of the precipitation they would normally see.
    "You wouldn't be able to fill a sardine can with the rain they've got since the twenty-second of June," said Phillips.
    The drought has created ideal conditions for billions of Asian aphids to infest Ontario's soybean crop.
    "I drive by and actually now I just shut my eyes and pretend I don't see it. It's just really, really, really dry," said <NAME/> Yuck, a farmer who lives near Ottawa and who has watched her corn whither and yellow over the past few weeks.
    "When they come on (the radio) every morning and say it's a beautiful sunny day, great to be at the cottage, I think a beautiful day would a good downpour for about 16 hours," said Yuck.
    Canada's largest city, Toronto, has experienced a record number of days with health alerts because of the heat and smog, with temperatures soaring as high as 37 C (99 F). Some Ontario residents now face fines for watering their yards.
    An Ontario woman was recently charged for dropping incendiary material near a forest after she threw her lit cigarette butt on a road in front of a police officer.
    "THE YEAR WITH TOO MUCH SUMMER"
    "I wish I could come up with a word that would describe the misery and the hardship that urban and rural folk are feeling," said Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment Canada who tracks national weather patters.
    "I would describe it maybe as the year with too much summer."
    The hot, dry spell could be a blow to the national economy. By the time the final bill is tallied for lost crops, aiding farmers, battling forest fires and generating more electricity, it could run into the billions.
    Quebec's multibillion-dollar agricultural sector, which accounts for some 16 percent of the Canadian industry's revenues and produces 38 percent of the country's milk, has also been hard hit since early July.
    In southern Quebec, where it has not rained for five weeks despite bouts of high heat and humidity, vegetable farmers have been working around the clock to save sun-ravaged crops.
    "The farmers are on the edge of burn-out, they can barely stand up," said <NAME/> St-Cyr, a spokesman for Quebec's powerful Agricultural Union.
    The Atlantic provinces have also been caught in the oppressive heat, the result of massive high pressure systems in the United States that, for weeks, have blocked the circulation of other weather patterns trying to make their way north.
    Clouds of red dust follow behind potato producers working the parched fields on <NAME/> <NAME/> Island, growers who may lose 25 percent of their crop. Blueberries in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have shriveled to look like raisins.
    "I think there are a majority of Canadians, probably, who can hardly wait for the winter. And I never thought I'd ever hear that," said Phillips.

Schedulers talking points on the separation of NNG/ENA


 

1.  NNG and ENA are entirely separate entities and our businesses are run entirely separate from one another.

2.  Customers may think that they can net ENA invoices against NNG invoices.  NNG is a separate business and is not responsible for ENA invoices to their customers.

3.  Should suppliers cut volumes for ENA; NNG will cut the market accordingly.

4.  Creditworthiness status for ENA remains the responsibility of the Commercial Department. We are to maintain our normal course of business until instructed otherwise.

I would like to recommend to following allocations of retention $'s - THIS CREATES NO NET IMPACT ON TOTAL $'S ON THE SPREADSHEET

Gain 575 cash 450 equity (<NAME/> Herndon, <NAME/> Forney, Joe Wagner, <NAME/> May)

Re-allocate in the following manner:
			Cash		Equity
	Arora		+75k		+75k
	Gilb-Smith	+25k		+25k
	<NAME/>		+25k		+25k	
	Gupta		+25k		+25k
	Misra		+75k		+75k
	Suarez		+50k		+50k
	<NAME/>		+25k		+25k
	Imai		+25k		+25k
	Steffes		+50k		+50k (we will lose key reg people if we don't pay)
	Nicolay		+50k		+50k ("                            "                            ") 
	Novosel		+25k		+25k ("                            "                            ") 

	

Please call with any questions.   I feel very good about keeping nearly all of these people at the levels above and we could lose some key ones if we don't do this.
Again, I am not spending any additional $'s - I am simply taking from other people who will not be part of UBS.

My Italian Amigos,

I have just received a fax from the Marincanto Hotel, Positano.  They do have availability for us beginning May 25 for 3 nights.  They have at least one standard double room (sea view) for Euro 186 (approximately $165 USD) and one superior double room (also sea view) for Euro 217 ( approximately $192 USD).  The only difference between the rooms that I can tell from their fax is that the superior room has a jacuzzi bath.  I do not know where in the room the jacuzzi is located.  This hotel has a private beach (I think I read somewhere in one of my books that there was a small nominal fee to use the beach) with a private descent (Wahoo!).  They also have private parking at the cheap price of Euro 18 per day and only a thousand (uphill each way) steps to it.  

Is this hotel still OK?  I do not know if they have two standard room and two superior rooms or just one of each type available.  Please let me know what your preference is.  I can clarify in my next fax.  If both our preferences are for the same type room and they only have one of each, shall we draw straws or have a pizza eating contest?

Also, there was one other hotel in Positano that I looked into before finding Hotel Marincanto for our Sept. trip but they were full.  I may look them up tonight and fax them tomorrow just to compare.

Please advise.

Thanks, <NAME/>.



P.S.  We also have a fax from Hotel Firenze in Rome that we are confirmed for June 7 & 8!

<NAME/>, <NAME/>, & <NAME/> --

Joe Short works on Project Phoenix (rebooking of old EES deals).  He is interested in any analysis that we may have provided related to the <NAME/> Properties deal with the Master Meter issue.  

If anyone has any old files on this, please send his way.  Also, any updates on where we stand (e.g., Ohio court cases) would be good.  

We probably need to have a review of our rights and obligations so that we can properly book the deal.  After we get Joe our info, we can regroup to determine next steps.

Thanks.  If anyone has any questions, please call.

I am losing my Logistics Manager/Transportation person, <NAME/> Farmer to AEP.  I have talked to <NAME/> Germany about this opportunity and he would like to do this job.  Does this create any problems for you?  Given the current uncertainty about NETCO headcount and considering any transition issues you may have with <NAME/> leaving, I thought we should leave things the way they are for now but develop a transfer date to be in a week or two.  If you are OK with this move, I would like <NAME/> to spend part of his time next week downloading from <NAME/> as I have him through next Friday.

On another matter, I believe <NAME/> has E-mailed you about an agency agreement that we have with Cleburne Plant that needs to be transitioned to the estate.  He knows the details as does <NAME/> Hill (I believe he is in your group).  We should probably get someone else in your group plugged into this deal (<NAME/> Kelly?), to handle to the administration of this deal.  We should try to identify someone quickly so that he/she can download from <NAME/> next week.

Hey <NAME/>,
	Sorry it took me so long to write back, but it is tough to do at work and I kept putting it off.  Sorry about that, I will get better at writing back. So what is up man?  How has the sea been treating you? So what have you been doing, and what have you seen?  Around here the same ole stuff is goin on. Work, Golf and hanging out.  Thats about it.  Ferg got his new Yelliw Lab at the end of April. He named him <NAME/>.  He's a pretty good lookin dog, but he has been cutting in to their sleep time.  <NAME/> and <NAME/> had to start wearing ear plugs at night because the dog kept whining.  I thought that was pretty hilarious. Well, I finally got promoted.  I am now a full time trader. Its pretty cool, but ot can be real stressful. I'm still pretty much doing what I was before, but now I have to take full responsibility in all profits and losses.  So far its been goin Okay, but the days when you have on the wrong positions it can really suck.  <NAME/>'s brother graduated last week from Galveston A&M.  He already got a job and started Wednesday for a shipping broker.  He is staying with us until July 1 then he is going to Paris to train for 3 months.  That should be pretty cool!  <NAME/> is still traveling alot. She went to Toronto, Miami, London, and she is going to Berlin in June.  Wer might be going to Italy in September for our anniversary.  She is going for work and I might try to tag along. The weather has  been pretty good around here lately, all the Golf course are in great shape.  I shot a 77 the other day at FT. Bend - 41-36.  Pretty inconsistent, but I'll take it.  I bogied 18 to miss shotting 1 under.  How's Cass doing. I keep meaning to call her, but I haven't yet.  We miss seeing you guys and look forward to kicking back and drinking some beer and listening to all your stories.  I hope all is well and lookin forward to seeing you soon.  Keep our country safe, we're counting on you.  "You and your faggoty white uniforms."  Just kiddin -

Hey <NAME/>,

The auction process concludes today and we should no who the winning bid is tomorrow.  It looks like it will be either UBS or Citigroup.  As far as our friends go: <NAME/> Hull got laid off and is looking for a job - he actually got offered to move back to risk but decided not to take the job b/c he thought he had something else in the bag - it turned out that he didn't;  <NAME/> Lenhart - is still here and is in the same boat as I am; <NAME/> Boucher - is still here and is handling the liquidation of EES' retail book - he may or may not continue on with EES depending on whether or not another company is willing to take a chance on EES - apparently there are some pkg deals in the works - he is also interviewing with other companies; <NAME/> got laid off and is touring Europe for a month; Gillette got laid off and moved to <NAME/> to teach English to young <NAME/>ns (how crazy is she?); and <NAME/> still has a job at <NAME/> in tax (the gov't always gets there $$) she is also looking for another job.
 
I think that just about covers everything.  I am sure that you have talked to <NAME/> and know his situation.  How is <NAME/> holding up? I never hear anything from him - tell him I said hello.
 
BTW, <NAME/> (my bro) get married in February.

<NAME/>, <NAME/>, & <NAME/> --

Can we sit down and discuss our strategies going forward in light of this RD?  I'd like to understand where there are opportunities (both for POLR outsourcing and standard market entry).  I don't think that there will ever be a huge surplus in generation (and there shouldn't be in a competitive market).  Instead of focusing on something the NYPSC can't control, why not work on demand responsiveness?  Better metering technology would certainly help.

Let me know when a good time would be?

Two other items when you get a chance:

Greetings TJ:

<NAME/> all is well with you and yours.  Two quick questions:

1) When can we expect to get our grades?  I have a tuition reimbursement "issue" and would like to get the grades ASAP.  Any idea?  Much appreciated.

2) Where do I go and how do I get there to uncover what classes I ended up getting in the bidding process.

Thanks for everything and have a great holiday.

2.	Total megawatthours of market-priced wholesale and retail sales for the 12 months ending March 31, 2001 (probably just get <NAME/> <NAME/> to sum up our monthly sales (I would have a separate total for wholesale financials) and use someone from <NAME/> Hughes shop for physical retail sales).

Understand.  <NAME/> has been Man's biggest account for years and during that time we have paid them a lot in commissions.  They approached us on Wednesday to try to increase the margin required, even though we were below the credit threshold that had been established in the contracts written 5+ years ago.  I refused to agree to change the margin calculations.  It became clear that Man was uncomfortable with the exposure to such a big account given that Man is a relatively small shop.  I agreed to xpit some positions such that they would get more comfortable with the outstanding risk in the account.  At the same time I told them I was transacting business as usual and if they couldnt handle/didnt want the clearing business I would clear somebody else but that was a permanent decision for them to make.  Clear our business always, or clear it never.  Paribas has stuck with us throughout and I intend to clear the majority of future biz with Paribas.  I agreed during hours of phone calls wednesday that we would xpit specific futures positions on thursday, which we did, but the rest of the position would stay there.  They agreed.  We specifically stated the rest of the positions and the options would stay and we would work out those positions over time.  &!@$ them if they are trying to go back on that.

With heightened security concern in the building this morning, I wanted to report two items:

1. When I parked in the <NAME/> Center Garage this morning, level 7 yellow section (at the top of the stairs from the <NAME/> building, just under the covered area), I noticed a large brown/copper truck.  I park my blue explorer in this same spot every day and I have never seen this truck before.  It's probably nothing, just wanted to report it.

2. When I reached my desk this morning I wanted to call in this concern.  I pulled up the corporate security number listed on the website 713-435-2804.  The woman that answered the phone was rude and said that the number wasn't corporate security, but rather building security -- she laughed and didn't seem remotely interested in my concern.  Perhaps, I misunderstood the website posting about who to call with security concerns.  But, if I did, perhaps other employees will as well....

Greetings folks.  The folks doing the appeal have asked me to inquire if you folks would be willing to sign on.  They understand (as do we) that the likelihood of prevailing is slim, but feel that beating the drum is important in continued effort to maintain current DA status and to attempt to preserve it going forward.  (DA seems to need all the help it can muster given that <NAME/> Wood and <NAME/> Barnett appear to have control of the issue at the PUC.) Could you let me know either way if you'll sign on.  <NAME/>, talked to <NAME/> yesterday, who said you'd be making the call on this one.  Thanks a bunch.

We've been experimenting with spreads on EOL and I want to lay out to you what happens when you transact a spread on EOL.

Assume you want to put out the COB/MC spread -4 at 4.  Also assume COB is 275 at 300.  As you know, if you put this out in the broker market, you would expect to buy COB $4 under Mid-C or sell COB $4 over.

If you want to duplicate these trades on EOL you could put out COB/MC -4 at 4, but here is what's going to happen (assume COB mid is 287.5).  If somebody 'hits' your 'bid' you will sell COB at 287.5 and buy Mid-C at 283.5.  If somebody 'lifts' your 'offer' you will buy  COB at 287.5 and sell MC at 291.5.  Effectively the EOL transaction turns your bid into an offer and an offer into a bid, or the title is COB/MC but the transaction is MC/COB.  The problem it seems to me is that, fundamentally, bid is always first, offer is second.  For this to work as is, the market would have to accept that, in all cases bid/offer applies except with EOL spreads where it's offer/bid.

This seems too confusing to me.  I'm not sure how you guys feel about  it, but I want to give you a heads up.

Please let me know a soon as possible this morning (by 9:30 if possible) what the annual dollars are we collect from NWPL & PNM for the Blanco Hub and from NWPL for the La Plata Facilities.  I need the total dollars (both the Operating and Market Services together).  I just need a ballpark number.  Whatever was the agreed to budget for 2001 on the Blanco Hub and whatever that flat fee is for the 3 years on the La Plata Facilities.

THANK YOU!!

<NAME/> has forwarded to me your letter of October 18 wherein you asked how <NAME/> wanted to handle several activities which you are now engaged (Trojan nuclear plant decommissioning, contract review for offshore sales and rep agreements and involvement in Transparency International).

<NAME/> has asked me to work with you on this.  Please let me know a good time to discuss.  Thank you.

Hey, buddie.  <NAME/> and <NAME/> still differ.  We're getting the transcript to verify.  I told them both that this is not something we should make a big issue out of since what the judge said in a "quip" from the bench will in no way alter our strategy or tactics.  They both agreed.  Soon as we get the transcript, we'll fill you in.  Let me know if this works for you.  (Please be easy with <NAME/>, she's pretty tense.)

Because we have lost several people to retail risk management (<NAME/> Herndon, Narsima Misra, <NAME/> Homco, etc.) and <NAME/> Forney has moved to ERCOT hourly, I have been forced to manage an EOL stack for multiple markets.

Therefore, all tours during trading hours (6:30 am to 3:30 pm) will have to be provided by non-trading personnel.

Sorry, but we are in our busiest season and I cannot afford to have my traders away from the desk for even 10 minutes.

For the following dates, we do not have Cycle 7 data in the database for PG&E (Pipeline #17).  These should have been reloaded from the saved html files.  Do we have these files, and if so, can you load the appropriate dates, in order the get the Cycle 7 data in for these points.


2/8/01
3/7/01	
3/8/01	
3/9/01	
3/10/01	
3/11/01	
3/12/01	


For the following dates, the data we have for Cycle 7 in the database does not match that in the spreadsheet that the west desk maintains.  We need to verify from the saved webpages whether our data is correct, and if it isn't, get it corrected.  I could check them, if you could print out the saved pages for me.	

2/12/01
2/27/01 
3/1/01 
4/11/01 	
4/16/01 	
4/17/01 	
4/18/01

For both of these, the actual date of capture will be several days later than the effective date for cycle 7.

<NAME/>, etal  --

Attached is the complaint that EES intends to file tomorrow against SCE related to the recoupment of our Negative CTC.  As you aware, after returning our customers to DA recently, our billing department was expecting that the past Negative CTCs would be returned to our customer's accounts - this has not happened nor after conversations with SCE will it occur.  

This complaint is the next step in the process of attempting to recoup these funds.  Primarily EES does not want to pay for Utility charges for our customers while an outstanding Negative CTC balance is due.

One key risk with filing this Complaint is that SCE may consolidate this case with the earlier Complaint that is currently on hold.  Probably not too big of a downside.

We will be paying the bills into the CPUC for holding until the resolution of the Complaint.

Any questions or issues please let me know.

Power December books are final.  This does not mean that every termination has been accounted for in the final Dec. 31 calculation.  We eventually hit a stopping point for terminations and will catch up the remainder of terminations in 'after December' books.

I know that some of this stuff can't be avoided, but I don't think we're even being careful about what is, or is not, said in the media.  I want a fair shot to deliver a solid company with good morale and a high self-esteem to Dynegy.  And mistakes like this don't help morale or the group's cohesiveness. Could you raise the concern at you 11:00 meeting if possible?

in general if a person turns down an offer to go to a divested company, it is considered a voluntary termination/resignation. We haven't made that decision here though. 

As to solicitation of employees back and forth, it will be a negotiated deal term. I can't recall if we put any provision on that issue in the bid template or not. Let me know if you want me to check the latest version

Nevada PUC Acts To Change Or Void Long-Term Pwr Contracts 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The Nevada Public Utilities Commission Wednesday voted to allow its General Counsel Office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate long-term electricity contracts entered into by the state's two largest utilities, a PUC spokeswoman said. 
The contracts would force <NAME/> Pacific Resources' (SRP) utilities <NAME/> Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power Co. to pay a higher price for power than current market rates, said <NAME/> Soderberg, PUC chairman. 
"We paid high prices when the prices were high, but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous," Soderberg said. 
No one at <NAME/> Pacific or Nevada Power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities, or the value of the contracts. 
The PUC action follows a letter sent by Gov. <NAME/> Guinn to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early October asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts. 
The General Counsel's office will now have authority to file with FERC and in court to plead against the current contracts. 
<NAME/> Pacific has said that a June FERC order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company. <NAME/> Pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices, only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices, the company has said. As well, if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market, it will now receive less for that power under the cap, it has said. 
California 's Public Utilities Commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $43 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state, which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since January.

Please forward along to others I may have missed but need to know:

The Commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the DA suspension.
With minor exceptions, the utilities told the Commission that the Commission didn't need to conduct hearings, and that the Commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees.  
The utilities said that hearings could be held "sometime later" to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the PX credit going forward.
A large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings.
There were lengthy arguments in front of the judge, at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference.
The next hearing will be on Dec. 12th.
The judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last Friday.
In sum, there will be another hearing on Dec. 12th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the Commission making decisions on these issues.
At this point, it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings.
Of particular note, at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is NOT inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of Direct Access to July 1, and that he didnt' think that the PUC commissioner assigned to the case was either. (Worried that he said too much, he then said he couldn't/shouldn't spead for the commissioner.)
The judge, and the Commissioner who was at the hearing, went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC (as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues).
Our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1) the Commission didn't need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2) the Commission doesn't have the authority to ask to see contracts and they ain't likely going to get them without a fight.  
Though the probability many not be high, there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts.  Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity.
Interestingly, <NAME/> made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January 1 its proposal to charge all customers--DA and bundled alike--for <NAME/>'s undercollection.  
The judge (literally) laughed off the request, and then said no.  
As a result, <NAME/> didn't get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue.
The judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing, e.g., "why are you here, you refuse to be a party, you refuse to provide info," etc.
From today's hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized.  
In related news, <NAME/> has announced that he's asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that he'd thus far met with two other generators in "serious negotitations."

Here are the foundations that ARM will use in its appeal of the PUC decision suspending DA (and threats to make it retroactive to July 1).  You should feel free to share with the business folks but under the condition that they keep it confidential.  And of course, we'd be thrilled if they'd sign on.  If you have any questions, just holler.
Best,
<NAME/>

The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows: 
The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees. 
The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f). 
The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process. 
The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. 
The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority. 
The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority. 
The Decision's purported findings are not supported. 
The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.

i think you didn't let it run long enough after your boost.  i think 30 minutes is the rule of thumb when you're battery is drained.  not turning over at all is not a good sign - one thing you can do is park on a hill when you're in doubt and then you can roll-start your jeep (if you have a standard) if you didn't let it charge long enough - if the battery is really, really dead, though, this won't work.  where's your jeep now?

The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19.  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California.

The public hearing was held in <NAME/>, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of this week. 

Attended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha.

Assisted the Mountainair team with the semiannual Title V compliance monitoring report  for C/S No.7.

A meeting was held in Phoenix, Az with PG&E to review charges and invoices by PG&E for PCB management and disposal activities on their system for the last several months.   Also discussed was recent liquids sampling results and proposed PCB activities on the PG&E system for 2002.

Great trading asset, but fixed costs are enormous.   The entire value proposition is based upon $15/Mwh spread between peak and off-peak (which is clearly there today).    My view is this spread collapses over time due to DSM/DG/real-time pricing and true hourly price signals in pool based markets.

We should look at the asset, but recognize the fixed costs are huge.

<NAME/>,

The attached table contains monthly flows to the referenced Southwest Gas meter points off of El Paso, Kern and PG&E.  As I indicated earlier, SWG may have deliveries off of Socal which we would not be able to see.  Also, there may be unidentified SWG meter points not included in the attached file, and we are missing some days of data so the actual numbers may be a little higher.  Finally, if this data is used for pricing/hedging analysis, one should be careful which prices they use for comparison.  SWG territory in California would be subject to California pricing, while that closer to the producing basins would be priced differently.  In addition, Southwest Gas owns transport capacity on El Paso, such that they were really only vulnerable to San <NAME/> or Keystone price fluxuations, and not Socal.  You could only make a hedging estimate if you knew their transport capacity, which I do not (it is available on El Paso's website).  Anyway, that's all I have.

A couple questions --

1.	Could the company include distribution wires as well, instead of being just a transmission only wires?
2.	How many shares would a divesting company get?  Could this be more that 5%?  If so, wouldn't this be over the "control" threshold?

In general, I fully support this type of action.

We should get the focus off of "micromanaging FERC".  This isn't about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.  Obviously, our view is that FERC's approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power. 

 I like the "gerrymandering" message.  A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a "camel" and that won't work for customers.  Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California's energy market.

My thoughts --

1.	Focus more on Tariff standardization (I think that this is the key issue for <NAME/> because LMP based bid balancing market is almost a done deal - and the Texas market seems to be fine for liquidity).  Build around a new proforma with a NETWORK PLUS model.
2.	I would highlight that size matters - re-double our arguments and documents on natural markets in this filing as attachments.
3.	I would highlight the importance of ending the control area benefits and also strengthen the arguments for no source/sink requirement.
4.	The gas / power industries are different not because the amount of vertical integration (ie, CNG) but because of the geographic reach.  Many LDCs used Columbia p/l, but only one LDC uses AEPs.  The electric market needs transmission to be "rationalized" across the marketplace so moving power to where it's needed from where it's at.
5.	Should we attack the 209 Boards?  Agree that they are unnecessary, but pls be careful.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

Each of you needs to send a book request for the East & West portfolios for the counterparties listed in the following spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet identifies those counterparties which we are still performing under the contracts.  Please create a East-Performance and a West-Performance book.  We then need to get all deals with the following counterparties moved to those books.  I would suggest you pull the values out of AdHoc as of 12/31 for the counterparties by desk before transferring them to the new desk.  Obviously these transactions will create prior days and the amount will run through the P&L in the old and new books and flatten out.  The remaining prior day value will need to be in Schedule E.

There appear to be two International Paper Deals.  <NAME/> Breslau got me a signed copy of the one terminating the deal for $12,163,283.  There was another International Paper deal the Confirmation Desk prepared a termination for in the amount of $1,311,164.  <NAME/>, any knowledge of this other one?

No copy either of the executed terminations of the Proctor & Gamble deals the Confirmation Desk prepared for (i) deal no. Y 49018.1 for $81,083, and (ii) deal no. 49011.1 for $442,000.

That just leaves the Socal-JP Morgan on <NAME/>'s list with no copy.

Dear <NAME/>

I apologize for not having responded earlier but I do not think I received the invitation, which is quite possible bearing in mind the difficulties here at the moment.  We have recently received approval from the bankruptcy judge to sell the portion of the business I jointly manage to UBS Warburg and in fact I am planning to relaunch enrononline (under our new entity) and we hope to be up and running around the time you are in Germany.

I am sure you understand that it is going to be a busy time for me in February combining the integration with UBS and restarting the gas and power trading operation under our new owner.

I appreciate your comments and thank you for your invitation but I do not feel able to accept.

I hope you all have a safe and enjoyable trip to Germany.

Coach <NAME/> Haslett had put together the perfect
New Orleans Saints team.
The only thing he was missing was a good quarterback.

He had scouted all the colleges, and even the high schools,
but he couldn't find a ringer quarterback
who could ensure a Super Bowl win.

Then one night, while watching CNN,
he saw a war-zone scene in Bosnia.
In one corner of the screen,
he spotted a young Bosnian soldier with a truly
incredible arm.
He threw a hand grenade straight
into a 15th-story window 200 yards away
--ka-boom!

"I've got to get this guy!"  Haslett said to himself.
"He has the perfect arm!"
So, he brings the kid to the New Orleans
and teaches him the great game of football,
and the Saints go on to win the Super Bowl
for the first time in history.

The young Bosnian is "canonized"
as the Great Hero of football,
and when Haslett asks him what he wants,
all the young man wants to do
is to call his mother.
"Mom," he says into the phone,
"I just won the Super Bowl."
"I don't want to talk to you," the old woman says.
"You deserted us.  You are not my son."
"I don't think you understand, Mother!" the young man pleads.
"I just won the greatest sporting event in the world.
I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans."
"No, let me tell you," the mother retorts.
"At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us.
The neighborhood is a pile of rubble.
Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives yesterday,
and today your sister was kidnapped in broad daylight."
The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says "
 ...I'll never forgive you for making us move to
New Orleans."

what are you having at burger inn?  

it has been too long - we'll have to fix it.  what are you doing this w/e?  

i feel like i've been sick for two weeks, and i haven't been doing much, mostly taking care of errands etc since i don't have much to do at work these days.  hopefully that will be changing soon.  

um, chrissy is much too cute to be playing with her toys alone.  

i'm not sure why lucky sucked - i think it was the crowd we met up with there.  you two should have come and it would have been more fun i'm sure.

Just a reminder that ENA received a letter from Tri-State last month and you are going to verify that Deal Nos. YB 5708.1 and 5833.1 are the only active financial deals with ENA.  If you can confirm, then we can indicate on the Master Log that Tri-State has actually terminated all outstanding trades effective as of 2/27/02.

I do not know where Dead Horse is but as far as <NAME/> <NAME/> is concerned, I believe the Index market to be around CIG Index minus $.05.

<NAME/>,

I checked with Wink and his prices were slightly lower per square foot but the builder was not keen on the panels Wink is selling because the dimensional lumber to frame windows and doors is not included.  So that reduces some of the savings.  Either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to $20,000 more for a 4000 sq ft home.  Even if I assume my energy savings will be $125/month, it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5% interest rate.  

Cost is a major concern, but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs.  I am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do.  What are some other alternatives that would also be effective?  Radiant barrier?  More attic ventilation?  

Thank you for your help.

Can you please provide the following information on invitees to the series of breakfast meetings:
(example noted below from today's meeting)

Name			Title		Group 				Direct Supervisor


<NAME/> Gossett		Director		Operations - Gas Risk (EA)	<NAME/> Hall 

La Metrice Dopson	Sr. Director	IT Infrastructure			<NAME/> Rub 



<NAME/>, <NAME/> and I need to have this information the day before the scheduled breakfast meeting.  The group description may be the most difficult to get, but you can look at this as a good way for you to get to know the leadership team within ENW and what they do.  I will be glad to help you with the details - just let me know.   Noting each employee's direct supervisor will just make it that much easier for us to understand where everyone fits into the organization.  

I would also like to have this information for the breakfast meeting that was held this morning.  Thanks.  

--<NAME/> 

Can I also take a look at the total list of employees that will be invited to the breakfast meetings?  The list that I used last week for Senior Directors and above for the Tuesday lunch meeting was not completely up-to-date.  I just want to be sure that we are not leaving anyone out.  Thanks.

see below - I still have to find someone whose email we can send the requests but I will do that by tomorrow

During weeks 1 through weeks 10 we will conduct free agent drafts.  Each team will start with 100 fantasy points to use for bidding on free agents and will be awarded points each week based on your finish that week.  The highest scoring team will receive 1 point and the lowest scoring team will receive 10 points.  Each Thursday at 12pm we will conduct a free agent draft.  You must submit a list of the players you want to bid on with the points you bid on them to an email address yet to be determined.  After 12pm the highest bidder for each player will we awarded the free agent.  You can bid 0 points for a player but will lose if anyone else bids at least 1 point.  

If you have a Defense or Kicker on a bye week, you can pick up a bye week replacement from the free agent pool for free.  After the bye week is over, you must drop the replacement player.  Bye week replacements must be submitted via email to mcuilla@enron.com and will be awarded based on lowest YTD points scored.

I'm concerned about the magnitude of the supply imbalance that we've built up again.  <NAME/> - are these numbers verified and up to date.  Can I get a breakdown of the 1.5 Bcf and the 700 MMcf current month portion.   It seems like we just worked down these balances in the fall and now we're building these balances back up again.  

If these supply imbalances are building up as a result of Phase V outages perhaps the payback gas use should be separately captured and recorded against the project.

If you recall there was a physical term supply transaction done at Thompsonville with EEX during the time you were trying to get the letter of intent with AEP done.  I thought that there were some unique financing issues that required <NAME/> to retain the transaction.  It appears that is not the case and since this supply is at a split connect location with HPL it should probably go with the sale.  I just want to make sure that the swap is done correctly to keep <NAME/> whole.  Any thoughts?

<NAME/>,
       Negotiations with SoCal have gone nowhere.  Out of the $6.0m (past and future) in dispute, they have only offered about $600,000 in value.  We're taking one more shot at negotiating a deal whereby they would take more capacity going west and/or having them buy out of West Texas lateral space which TK and <NAME/> would sell for incremental revenue.  If this doesn't prove fruitful, then I would intend to pursue the FERC decision.  Agreed?

I think the confusion with this lies in the fact that last month we had the same issue and I thought you put these deals that are desk to desk in tagg back on my region.  These relate to fixed price lock ins with Peoples.  I think what happened last month happened again this month which is settlements and the risk person did not get the fixed price lock ins done until the following month.  We will have to try and work on this for this month.  The problem is that they can take their volumes on several deals and we have to wait until it is completely scheduled.  Sorry for the confusion.

Hi Sweetie,
 
I still can't believe all of this, we are laying off people here left and right, our traders are trying to call in favors to find jobs for as many people as possible.
 
We are still trying to deliver on contracts, and not all of our counterparties have cut us off.  I can't imagine for the life of me why anyone would continue to do business with us!
 
I love you, and <NAME/> and Riley

<NAME/>,

Hey, I checked out the test chart you did for outages.  Nice work!  I'm already thinking of many other things we'd like to have.  Does this charting tool, allow us to customize the chart features to the extent excel does?  Can you manually set the min and max values on the axis?  We like some of the charts to have the same axis settings so that the bars can be compared from one chart to the next.  If so, <NAME/> can tell you how we'd like them set.  Let's also discuss what interactivity we can build into this page.

If the gathering deal is an interruptible type structure, this form would not work.  For use by Crescendo, this form will also need to be scrubbed for Utah and Colorado law issues.  However, this is a starting point.  Let me know if you have any questions.

I don't blame you.  Obviously she's not dependable and her heart isn't in it, not to mention the fact that she doesn't know what she's doing and I don't think she wants to learn.  That was pretty obvious when I was training her--she never seemed to be interested in the job, otherwise she would have tried to learn all she could and would have at least taken some pride in her work.

I talked to Giffels today and he mentioned that SONGS units are under serious security scrutiny given its location.   He gave us a 50/50 probability that Indian Pt 1&2 (30 minutes north of NY City) and Pilgrim (15 minutes north of Boston) would be shut down in the near term for security reasons.

He mentioned that SONGS was also a candidate.   I personally don't think the probability is that high, nonetheless, the rumors seem to be in the market.

How can I install new programs on my laptop, without

One example: when I travel I use AOL to get access to my mail

 Also, I have my private statistical software
I often use when I work at night during business trips.

Hey <NAME/>,

not sure what you guys are up to, likely making yourself pretty for potential investors?  

we're not quite at that point yet here, so things are very slow which has given me some
time to look into R (been on my list for quite some time).  It looks very good!  have you
had a chance to look into it?  i'd like to verify that it's worth putting some time into.  

hope things are going well and i'll give a call to chat sometime soon.

Team,

We now have the capability of importing live EOL quotes into our models if so desired.  <NAME/> Tonks, who supports IT development efforts for the trading floor, has made this capability available to us via a file that I have now saved in the Models directory under the name "EOL_Product_Listen".

In order to run the file, you will first need to run a program called "Tibco Rendezvous Client"  You can run this program by going to the Start Menu/System Utility Applications/Installation and Disk Creation/"Install Tibco Rendezvous Client".  You will have to reboot after installation is complete.  After rebooting you can then open the program "EOL Program Listen".

The program has 2 sheets: 1) EOL, and 2) EOL_Search

Sheet 1 (EOL) is the sheet that pulls in the live quotes based on an EOL ID number that you enter in column C. In order to determine the correct EOL ID number, you need to use Sheet 2 (EOL_Search).  On this sheet, you can enter a search string in cell B1 and then hit the search macro.  Efficient use of this search macro requires some trial and error since the search is limited to a max number.  Once you find your product ID #, you can enter it into Sheet 1 (EOL) and then hit the "Start" button.  You will then be pulling in live quotes which can be linked to any model which you wish.

A word of caution:  We will likely all find limitations into how this tool can be effectively used.  For instance, it has been brought to my attention that the product ID #'s change each month as new prompt months roll on.  Thus, the tool should be used with discretion and verification that the right ID # is linking up should always be verified, especially on older files.  Nonetheless, as we get comfortable with the tool, I believe that it will provide some value on deals that require real-time pricing inputs.

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.  I can provide a quick demo at my desk if anyone wishes.


Thanks,

<NAME/>

so - here's the synopsis - everything is business as usual - we have alot of cash and almost all of our counterparties are supporting us 100% - we are about to get more credit lines within a few hours - it's going to be rough but everything being done right now is to protect the gas and power trading businesses and we will be the best compensated people in the company.

From a valuation standpoint I assume Case 1 would give us the highest multiple.  The issue is is it doable?  We have achieved $600 million last year.  Also, before we go further with Project Armstrong I would like to get Whalley and Dynegy to agree that if the discussions are successful we would do the deal.  Let's suspend these discussions for the time being.

Lorelie, attached is a Price Distribution table that is set up as a template for SPPC Power load as it relates to market prices  and load.  As you can see, this distribution protects your rate base against a rising price environment and partially floats with market prices as they move down.  The distribution ( fixed price vs floating ) may move up a percent or two in relation to the outright price desk that we face today ( relative to the historical numbers) but those iterations can be made as required.

Pls review and we can discuss at your convenience.

Also, as discussed, I am looking for ways to enhance our ability to transact with you on gas structures but in light of the overall credit positions that may be difficult.  With that being said however, I do believe that we can stream some structures to the physical contracts in gas and ensure that from the physical point of view ENA and SPPC are both protected and I would like to pursue this with you. One area that I would like to start with to have SPPC sell ENA physical gas ( 30,000/40,000/day) against a physical gas daily related price.  Once I have accumulated a payables position, we inherently create a secured line without having to change any of the contracts/paper currently in place.  I am also sure this will require further discussions and look forward to catching up with you soonest.

regards, 

<NAME/> Tycholiz

We did recommend using the DJ index.  But subsequent to that, I believe we filed as part of the "ARM" coalition, recommending a bottom's-up approach.  Is that right <NAME/>?  However, I don't think it's accurate to say that we "withdrew" the DJ index recommendation.  Both our original DJ recommendation, and the bottom's up recommendation, are still sitting at the PUC.  I think that's how things currently stand.

Hi Kyle!

I must not have your current office telephone number.  Please send it to me.  I would like to connect up with you this weekend if you are available.  I cleaned all of our closets last week and have the "big load" that I would like to pass on to you for your MANNA collection.  

How on earth are you?  I am still sad and overwhelmed from the Sept. 11 tragedy.  I cannot believe we watched that event unfold like that!  These are certainly interesting times....

Call me or email me, I'd like to visist!

Dear <NAME/>, 

Per our conversation on this past Monday, here is the letter we talked about.  We have an original that will be placed in the mail today.  Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.  We look forward to hearing from you soon.

You are welcome to attend any of these.  In fact, it is helpful for cross calibration purposes if there is some cross over in the meetings.  Do get with <NAME/> and <NAME/> before the meetings to give them ffeedback on those book administrators who are problematic.  

PATTI:  Please add <NAME/> to the attendee list for the Risk and Settlements PRC meetings.  Thanks.

Yes it is irrelevant.   Now that we have competent risk managers making the decision, they will know how to effectively hedge these deals.   Furthermore, pricing is always available on demand.   When each trader has 30-40 products to manage in a volatile market, they are not necessarily going to put 03-10 for peak and off-peak in every region.

It becomes very cumbersome to manage the year over year spreads when the front is moving so violently.

Please pass on the condolences of another part of the Auburn family to Mr. <NAME/>.  We are all truly hurt by the passing of his mother.  From the recent articles I have read in the Alabama papers, it appears she was a phenomenal mother and friend.  We were also pleased to see his positive comments regarding his teammates, fellow students and alumni of Auburn.  The auburn spirit is special and it means a lot to those of us who spent time there to hear current players and students share the same beliefs.  We are sure he will continue to honor his mother and her memory by his outstanding play on the field and dedication in the classroom.  Thank you Mr. <NAME/> for making us all proud to be an Auburn Tiger.  Please respond via email to let us know if the University or anyone else has set up a memorial fund or scholarship in her name.  We would really like to donate money in her name.  Thanks and War Eagle.

Yes, you are correct.   <NAME/> is making the changes I requested and we probably have at least another 2 weeks before I get a final plan.

With respect to your latest Contract, I have 2 minor changes.  The only one with any significance is the counterparty name.   I expect <NAME/>-Carroll Custom Homes to be the signator to this Agreement.   Having a "shell" LLC entiity sign the Contract would be like me having my step-son sign the Contract.

I want the "real" balance sheet to be on the hook for meeting the contractual obligations, much like you want my personal balance sheet/income statement to be the responsible financial counterparty.

The other change was wording and does not effect the contract intent.

Talk to you soon.

Here is the file.  It contains only financial trades in the active NG-PRICE book.  Also these are only Price, Basis, Index, and Gas Daily values.  They don't contain any Options.  I will get another book set up so we can move only positive net value deals with counterparties.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Ok, but make sure the documentation of the email follows the invoice for the payment, otherwise we will have to go back to him to appriove the payment.   On the otherhand, there is no reason that a DASH can't be used for non-discretionary approvals as well, and if it doesn't have to go to RAC, then it doesn't.

No this is definitely not the final document.. Issues 1-3 are correct and complete, but 4 & 5 are not. 
I imagine 6-10 pages in reporting requirements for Gas Daily Options and Pipe Options alone. 

While we are still working on these requirements we can move forward on 1-3 and the deal entry and new deal type 
for basis options.

<NAME/>,

Attached is the pulp presentation. Please take a look and let me know of any changes or additions.
Also, tissue facts are taken from a bank of America report as RISI does not have any studies on it. I found one guy in Germany that seems to do quite an extensive work on tissue. I sent you an email yesterday stating what he can offer us and what the costs are.

Also note that fluff pulp data is very limited. I am waiting <NAME/> Pinault from RISI to get back to me as he is researching and digging inside his organization to find anything on the fluff pulp. All these data can be added to the presentation upon availiability.

What do you think? I see pro's and con's.
The argument against is that during PRCs people comment
positively or negatively about a person and this is how
the word is spread about an employee.

ENA has ITM terminated positions with six bank counterparties (identified below).  Settlement is part of the ongoing EGM liquidation.

We have an approximate $70 million ITM position with Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P.  I have collected all confirms for rate/currency and weather. We need the MTM values and confirm list now because we cannot have PWC validate or pursue negotiations with Goldman.  This is the most urgent matter.

With respect to the remaining five bank counterparties, I have collected rate/currency confirms.  I need nat gas and liquids confirms, MTM values, etc.to proceed.

Can you please identify Goldman confirm numbers and MTM values now?  PWC will also need.

Also, can we establish a priority for the remaining bank counterparties?

I know you guys are busy so let's talk soon.  Thanks.  <NAME/>

Greetings <NAME/>:  Few things.

<NAME/> <NAME/> did an extremely good job of talking about your plan at DJ's thing in Yountville.
Thanks a million for helping to identify someone who's a bit more "outside the box" to help on the Lodi power plant/gas storage deal.  Any indication of who that person might be? We're anxious to start meeting with them.
Any word on getting a conference call together with the large customers?
Finally, have you told the PUC yet that you won't be filing any stinking GRC?  If so, how have they reacted?

Have a great holiday weekend.

Best,
<NAME/>

In the lunch meeting that I held yesterday, I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on ways to improve employee morale at present.  I can always count on <NAME/> Superty to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request - and to act!  Here are his ideas.  My thought is to get together an informal team (doesn't even have to be announced or publicized) to continue to generate ideas that could make a difference to employee morale right now and to make some of these things happen.  Any thoughts?  --<NAME/>

Your perception is correct.   Remember 4 years of culture is at work here.   I told <NAME/> this morning, we have to move to 35, clearly define the process for pricing deals, and begin changing the mindset of the marketing organization with respect to value.

The whole situation on 6 is considerably worse than I originally thought.

1)  Did you add to the numbers that <NAME/> and I reviewed with you on Sunday?  You had mentioned folding in some analysts and associates - did you do that?  UBS was asking me about numbers today, and I wanted to be consistent with the answers. 

2)  What about Calgary?  You were going to ask <NAME/> M. to have <NAME/> Hedstrom coordinate over the weekend.  Didn't hear from her.  Are you handling this through <NAME/>?  Or do you want me to include Calgary operations in the final org chart for Netco Operations?  --<NAME/>

FYI - reminder that the last person here every night needs to publish to the web the East P&L and the East Positions.  Everyone should have access to this and if you do not know how to load these files, let me know.  We have all been guilty of forgetting this, including myself.  We owe a big thank you to Kulvinder who has saved us a couple of nights in the last week.  Thanks.

FYI Regarding Mn EC Closing.

I really enjoyed our talk last night.  You gave me some really good advice.  

I'm sure that vacation/going out of town is the very last thing that you feel like thinking about, but when you're up to travel thoughts let me know if you would be interested in going to the Hill Country Hyatt some weekend.  I think <NAME/> would love the water rafting.  We could go the weekends of May 11, 18 or 25 if you are interested.

Talk to you soon.  <NAME/> really, really wants to have <NAME/> come over to play soon!

<NAME/> --

After our conversation today, I thought that I'd outline some Q&A topics for you to consider --

1.	How does NERC define "security"? (important to differentiate between national security and system security).
2.	What is NERC's role in national security?
3.	<NAME/> RTOs degrade national security?  system security?
4.	What does <NAME/> think about calls to restrict access to network information such as transmission maps?
5.	Does <NAME/> oppose additional emphasis on securing electricity infrastructure?

This Q&A should not be released to the public.  I think this is just to make sure that all of Govt Affairs is on the same page and our DC team has good answers to hard questions.

Thanks.

Whenever we prepare an amendment, we usually add other document "upgrades" (i.e., our form changes).  We have made some important changes since 1999.  I just wanted to alert you to these so that we don't "surprise" your customer.

<NAME/>, the account number in the original document is actually not incorrect. This was the account to which the funds were to have been deposited to. However, SCE deposited the funds to a different account.  As a result, I agree that we should amend the document to reflect that the account where these funds where they actually ere actually sent and this will conclude our busines. 

Your file did not come over correctly but if you could hand correct the original documents by changing the banking instructions and fax to me, i will provide proper signatures on amendment and we are done.

<NAME/>, trust all is well. 

I just wanted to update you on a couple of things and re-check SMUD's interest.

1. The on again off again PGT assignment of 10,000 MMBTU per day out of Nov. 2002. appears to have surfaced from our counter party again and under the assumption you are still interested I will forward to you latest offer once we have FIRMED it up with the third party. 

2. It is my understanding that you own El Paso - PG&E Topock capacity until May 31, 2003.  ENA has some of the same capacity and is prepared to offer this into the market place from the period June 1, 2003 - May 30, 2006. ( with the renewal rights), PLUS some sort of " Payment " from ENA to SMUD.  Rather than renew your existing capacity at full tolls, this is a way to pick up transport below the normal tariff and retain renewal rights after 2006. 

Pls advise if either of these points capture your interest. 

Thanks in advance, 

<NAME/> Tycholiz

<NAME/>,

I received your email on the Killeen post office.  I am still having a tough time making the math work.  Can you prepare a spreadsheet that would show why the post office is such a good investment?  Maybe the assumptions I am making about interest rates, expenses, or value at the end of the lease are incorrect.

Hi, <NAME/>!

<NAME/> said that he has passed AK Steel along to you to look at.  I told him that I thought things were passed down the chain, not up and he said that when you are as good as he his, they are passed up the chain.  You may have something different to say about this.

Anyway, <NAME/> Motley at AK is calling checking on the status of the ISDA.  We originally were going to have it signed, but when <NAME/> called <NAME/> about initialling, he said Credit wanted to revisit the credit, so can you let me know the status so that I can tell <NAME/>?

Thanks!

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.

<NAME/> I am sorry about your loss, mostly because those in the family of God hate to see pain hit a family member.  Even under the most dire and seemingly impossible situations, God is in control.  Its His promise that He will never leave us nor forsake us.  That in itself, is a real comfort and security knowing we have His eternal and loving spirit with us at all times.  When you get some time, read Romans 8:28 and then meditate on it.  So many times we confuse our wants for our needs and that are promised by Him. Because he desires to conform us inito the image of His Son, sometimes He has to empty us of worldly understandings and unrighteousness so that He can fill us with blessings that glorify Him. Once we make a heart commitment and His spirit sets up residence within us, God's promise in Romans is to work everything, including a job loss to His glory.  If we are eternally minded and understand that our citizenship and home is in heaven, then life on earth begins to look less important and we see the worldly goods as being very temporary.  I will pray for you and your family that you see a manifestation of God's work in your life and that you are brought even closer unto Him in your <NAME/> walk.  I will keep my ears open for any employment opportunities. 

When you're feeling down and discouraged, drop me a line.  Sharing <NAME/> with someone always seems to help me through the day in difficult situations.  In Hebrews were told  to encourage the brethren.  I would consider it an honor to hear form you again....keep the faith...  its all we have.........

Hi!  It has been a long time!  As you know things here are very shaky.  I can't believe the big E has crumbled!  Who would have ever guessed!  Everyone is completely disappointed and mostly pissed off.  I'll have to give you the inside scoop sometime when we get together!  And we need to!  I'll be traveling around making my rounds to find out what's in the market place soon. So, hopefully I'll get a chance to see you.  Any chance of you and <NAME/> coming down?  We have plenty of room for the two of you; you're always welcome.  I love your house!  Thanks for sending the picture.  Its so exciting but its also a lot of work!  I'm glad I'm done!  It's nice to be in the house, but also funny all the work and effort you put in and how exciting it is all those months while you're in the process....all to be completely indifferent with it afterwards!  Its very strange, but what to do?  <NAME/>, I can't believe is 3!  And a very terrible 3.  My hands are full!  I'm contemplating of putting her in ski school this winter.  She quite the daring child, so I think she'll enjoy.  Ask <NAME/> for me if this is too young.  She won't think so, its mostly my fear. =3D)  You'll get a kick of the pictures I've attached.  One of them is my depiction a young <NAME/> <NAME/>. Hopefully you saw Almost Famous to understand my analogy!  You'll also notice the Beagle that <NAME/> bought for <NAME/>.  HAHA! His name is Presley.  She's absolutely in love with him.

So I never got paid (expenses) for my tickets home.  Surprize!!!!!  So if I cancel - obviously as I didn't go.  Can I then reclaim the economy ones I booked for my parents and brother instead as I did not take my 2001 entitlement.  The tickets were all economy (4 x $1374:74).  A lot cheaper still than three business seats.

This is the last file I sent Dierdre.  It has four tabs.  One summarizes the monthly cash flow into two columns (Peoples Deal and PERC Deal).  The monthly values are PV'd.  The PERC tab is the Lagrasta deals.  The Peoples Deal is broken into two tabs (Baseload Sale and Transport).  The baseload sale includes all of the price fixing deals as well as the index -$.03 deal.  Transport is just that.  I hope this helps.

Looks like Enpower is "on the side of the road" with respect to capturing and valuing retail deals.   As we discussed in yesterday's meeting, Plan B is a more robust spreadsheet that unbundles the components and values them separately and creates postions by risk component.

I know this is easier said than done, but we need a tactical solution that gives the group confidence that value and positions are correct, rather than a bundled black box batch value with hard coded assumptions.

<NAME/>, it appears that we pay a monthly fee of $ 89.99 / mth plus monthly optional charges and all long distance and local charges.  I would like to discuss the details of a bill. What is this base fee, are there other plans available? Are we getting any value in using cingular ( especially this plan). How many minutes are we getting what are the  long distance and roaming rates? 

In aggregate, my monthly cell phone bill for my group looks to be around $1,400 - $ 2,000/mth for 7 people total and this is a little high. 

Also, pls verify who has cell phones in <NAME/> and what the monthly bills look like for this office.

Thanks, BT

<NAME/>, it seems that the letter we received from <NAME/> is otherwise.   In the process of having the Navajo EPA take over the drinking water program for the Tribe, the EPA as overseer wants to be kept in the loop for a little while longer.  In light of this, we need to not only send to the EPA all monthly sampling reports for drinding, but also to the <NAME/> <NAME/> of the Navanl Nation.  I spoke with <NAME/> about this and he said that the EPAs involvement would start  to deminish in the future but he didnt when.

Thanks for the info.  I have been building spreadsheet cases all day.   FYI - majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers, its driven by the volume.  I made the appropriate changes on <NAME/>'s spreadsheet.


A couple of further things that I need:
- I need to reconcile the net volume on <NAME/>'s sheet by month with the net cash out volumes on <NAME/>'s sheet.  There are huge differences.  Can these really all be receipt imbalances?

<NAME/> for the months Aug 00-Jul 01 can you break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances.   We are only planning to put the majority/minority pricing on the market area imbalances.


Let me know if you guys want to sit down and talk through this.  I need to get Teb my final analysis by the end of the week.

Development of Sonoran Pipeline Project Halted

02/15/2002 
PR Newswire 
(Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire) 
HOUSTON, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004. 
Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market. 
Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California. 
Based in San <NAME/>, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com . 
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects.

<NAME/>,

Attached is the memo I promised.  It's sort of rough, but accurate.  Please feel free to utilize any or all of it.  It would be interesting to get <NAME/> <NAME/>'s feedback as well.  Also, this doesn't really address my concerns with respect to curtailing firm exports under muni-transmission (at least not completely).   If you have any questions, let me know.

PG&E utility reorganization draws fire in Calif 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - PG&E Corp.'s plan to reorganize its bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric unit, California's biggest utility, is coming under fire as a bid to dodge state regulation. 
Critics said that with California beginning to emerge from a two-year energy crisis triggered by a failed deregulation law that drowned the state's utilities in red ink, now is no time to abandon state oversight. 
<NAME/> Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), called the plan "a regulatory jailbreak" and "a corporate shell game to evade proper state regulation" by transferring assets to unregulated PG&E affiliates. 
The reorganization plan would split the parent company and its utility into stand-alone companies, transferring the hydro network, Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant and gas and electric transmission systems to unregulated units of parent PG&E. 
The utility would continue to own and operate local gas and power distribution grids serving about 13 million customers. 
The plan would allow all valid creditor claims to be paid without the need for a rate increase or state bailout, said <NAME/> <NAME/>, chairman, president and chief executive of PG&E. 
It would provide creditors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. 
EYE ON HYDRO SYSTEM 
One of the concerns arising from the plan is how Pacific Gas & Electric would continue to manage its hydroelectric properties, which make up the world's largest privately held hydropower system. 
Elected officials from 28 counties in PG&E's sprawling hydro watershed in central and northern California will meet Friday to weigh actions on the reorganization plan filed at the San <NAME/> federal bankruptcy court Sept. 20. 
The Regional Council of Rural Counties is worried about who will safeguard the environmental health of the hydro system's rivers and lakes that are the foundation for fishing, boating and tourism in an area that sprawls across about two-thirds of the state, council vice president <NAME/> Lujan told Reuters. 
PG&E spokesman <NAME/> <NAME/> said the hydro system, nuclear reactors and transmission systems would continue to be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
The utility also would continue to get power from plants it now owns under a 12-year deal at 5 cents per kilowatt hour. 
But State Attorney General <NAME/> Lockyer said he is looking closely at the plan because of "serious concerns the utility is seeking to evade further scrutiny by the CPUC" and avoid state laws on the asset transfers. 
Lockyer said that in the past, PG&E had used CPUC oversight as a shield against federal scrutiny. 
Despite PG&E's claim that the CPUC has no jurisdiction on the transfer of power and transmission assets to the parent, CPUC chief counsel <NAME/> Cohen said the agency's approval is required under state law. 
'FIRE SALE PRICES' 
"PG&E's goal is clear. They want to transfer most of the utility's valuable assets to an affiliate company, at fire sale prices, so that they will no longer be subject to any state regulation. It is a deregulation plan, not a reorganization plan," Cohen said. 
"PG&E's plan conflicts with California's interest to have a more stable and regulated energy system. Deregulation has failed the public, and we will look at every opportunity to put down this attempt to solve the failure of deregulation with more deregulation," said <NAME/> Heller, of consumer advocate The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. 
PG&E's <NAME/> said the plan makes the most sense for California because units of PG&E would continue to own and manage power production and transmission. 
<NAME/> said, however, the reorganization plan does not bar a future sale to another company. 
PG&E's plan would give the utility $4.5 billion from the asset transfers to help pay off about $13 billion in debts, including $9 billion in unrecovered power purchase costs. 
The CPUC's Cohen and consumer groups said PG&E should receive far more than $4.5 billion from the assets. 
They point to the value of the hydro network. Last fall, the utility dropped a plan to sell the hydro system to its parent for $2.8 billion because the system was "undervalued in today's market" and could fetch a much higher price through an auction. 
The PG&E utility and <NAME/> International's Southern California <NAME/> utility amassed billions of dollars of debt because the deregulation law prevented them from passing steep wholesale power prices to their customers. 
SoCal <NAME/> and the CPUC reached a deal Oct. 2 to keep the utility out of the bankruptcy court and pay off its creditors.

No problem.   $0.50/Mwh is enough for this service.   You don't need to pay a $1.00/Mwh.   I would say anytime she gets more that $75/Mwh, she gets a $1.00/Mwh to keep her motivated to sell at the highest price.

Sound OK?

<NAME/> as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01.

Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits and has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, the permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this e mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is complete, but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on October 15 and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  The ADEQ plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov. 19 in <NAME/> AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  <NAME/> is located approx. 30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is the Council Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have been no responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review process, they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced them otherwise (<NAME/>, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There was also an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.

Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from <NAME/> Kohn, the permit engineer for the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  There are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public comment period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this date, it will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign off on the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As of this date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the permits for station 3 and or 4.

Ill keep everyone apprised of future events.

I'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that Angelides sent to <NAME/> last Friday.  If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.  In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on <NAME/> and the PUC.  Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to "homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises..."  Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.

The concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.  

To her credit, <NAME/> refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.

In light of these events (and the increasing attacks on <NAME/> by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give <NAME/> an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:

Angelides is all wet--DA and "fairness" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis.
Re-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.

Folks may have other points to make.  Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.  

A letter might be useful in order to 1) give <NAME/> some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.

Any thoughts?  

Best,
<NAME/>

Commissioners <NAME/> M. Duque and <NAME/> A. Bilas, dissenting:

One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.

We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. 

Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. 

	DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  

	We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. 

For these reasons we must respectfully dissent.

As some of you may be aware, <NAME/>'s consulting arrangement with <NAME/> ends later this fall.  In an effort to make the transition as easy as possible, I would recommend that the following people work with <NAME/> to transition on critical committees and tasks (nothing is hardwired, so if we need to change people, let me know).

<NAME/> will attend the upcoming WSCC EPITF meeting (not sure of date, but think in the next two weeks).  My recommendation is that <NAME/> <NAME/> attend with <NAME/> and become the lead.  We may not get a voting seat after <NAME/> leaves, but we should try and cover.

<NAME/> Alvarez should attend the WSCC Board Meeting on Aug 27 with <NAME/> to pick up these responsibilities.

<NAME/> Yeung should pick up coverage for the FlowBased discussions.  <NAME/> will not attend the next meeting in Chicago that takes place on Aug 30.  

<NAME/> Rodriguez should pick up the Security Coordinator Subcommitte discussions that take place Sept 25 - 27.  <NAME/> will not attend.

I think that <NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/> and I should attend the NERC Stakeholders Mtg on Oct 15 - 16.

Finally, <NAME/> Perrino should go with <NAME/> to the next WSCC OCTPG meeting.

Let me know if this transition plan works.

The cash was posted as initial margin on trade date of the swaps.  We have confirmed that all trades were terminated as of mid-December, 2001.

<NAME/>,  Per our discussion, attached are drafts of <NAME/>'s Master Firm agreements.  Sorry for the delay.  

  

<NAME/>'s preference would be to use these master instead of the GISB agreements for the firm deals.  The Firm GTC were really meant as a stop gap until we could be these Masters in place.  I did review the GISB we currently have in place with Northern States Power (WI and MN).  These agreements do not have the necessary credit provisions and termination payment provisions required for firm deals that are included in our attached Master.  These Masters should address the specific concerns included in your email.

1.  The Masters contains provisions to deal wth the possibility that a price will not published on any day in the same manner as the GISB does.
2.  The netting issue we need to address.  The GISB don't have netting provisions, but we don't use GISB for any firm deals over 1 month in term.  I am not sure I understand the regulatory issues with respect to netting.  These Master contain netting provisions.  Let's discuss once you have reviewed the Masters.
3.  Force Majeure provisions are similar to the GTC.  <NAME/> prefers a vary narrow definition of FM.  We modify the GISB FM to reflect this with special provisions.  If you could provide specific comments we can address your issues.
4.  Audit provisions are included in the Masters.
5.  Any affirmative action statutes and regulatory provisions can be address in this Master.  If you could provide specific language we can address this issue.

Putting these Master in place would really make business going forward much more efficient.  Please review and let's discuss and your earliest convenience.  I can be reached at (713) 853-3512.

Glad that the two of you could make the trip to <NAME/> this week.  Hopefully, your the time spent here was worthwhile in terms of sharing ideas and further developing contacts.  I <NAME/>, I will look forward to continue dialoge as we explore commercialization opportunities.  <NAME/>, I will get back with you next week on potential dates for the annual global risk management operations offsite (late Oct) and on likely dates for my next trip to London. 

I enjoyed the shopping and dinner.  --<NAME/>

deepthroat is rather provocative, don't you think?

<NAME/>, 

This stuff looks perfect. I think I like the 385-B the best. I don't think I want the hutch though. So I guess I need 3 pieces (385-512,519,533). Can please order the pieces you don't have in stock. Also, this Thursday is just fine to deliver that stuff. Can you please remind the guys in the warehouse to pick up that loveseat at <NAME/> House. Be sure to let me know what it cost to fix that so I can bill the moving company. 

Thanx for all the help!

<NAME/>,

I've been talking with <NAME/> over the last couple of weeks about possible opportunities at <NAME/>.  Just to give you a quick look at my background, I've been running <NAME/>'s short-term Northwest desk for about 4 years.  Prior to that, I performed more or less the same function with PGE for a couple of years.  My contract with <NAME/> is up July 31.  I'm under a 3-month noncompete obligation after I leave <NAME/>.  Theoretically, my last day with <NAME/> could be May 31, so the first day I'd be able to start somewhere else would be Sept 1.

To be honest, at this point I'm shopping.  My goal is to have 3-4 options to consider by May 31.  I'll be in Salt Lake on May 4, so if you are interested in getting together to talk about any opportunities <NAME/> might have, please let me know.

Thanks,

<NAME/>

Bjorn,

I don't think the scope of the project is really that big. When we looked
into it, it seemed like a relatively minor issue. 

To me, it's  really a matter of routine maintenance that should not be
an equivalent of a Desert <NAME/> operation.

Zimin and I will call Slava on Tuesday and determine what has to be done.

As long as accounting doesn't have a problem with it, I don't see why not.  The P&L will probably need to be redone for the 31st (Jan) and 1st (Feb).  It just depends on what deals change.  If it is only annuities, then only last day will need to be recalced.

I started looking at the prompt month positions yesterday and noticed that many of the deals moved to the bankruptcy book have not been deleted in sitara.  I don't think that most people checked the bottom of the sitara deal to see that the volumes were zero for future months.  I started comparing the Bankruptcy index book to a prompt month calc. and fixed as much as I could for the East and West, I just started on Central but we should check this all again on Monday.  Because of this, we have not reported any prompt month physical value.  The rates group hasn't been around to get the demand charges either.  We should have everything clean to report it on Monday.

Going forward I guess we need to show people how to check it correctly.

See you on Monday.

<NAME/>,  I reviewed the form provided.  Some comments	

1.  Generally we should make every attempt to get these guys to use our paper.  From an ENA Upstream overall standpoint, if we start using other forms then we lose consistency with how these deals are administered (payment, noms., etc).  

2.  With respect to this form there are some conceptual issues.
	A.  No specific measures of damages if the parties breach
	B.  No detail on the type of gas being purchase (i.e. Wellhead, Pooling Point, firm, interruptible)  Contract states that "Seller shall use reasonable efforts to deliver 	and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to purchase". We would have to tie this down.
	C.  Nomination deadlines and notification for production variances is not addressed.

3.  There are also some legal issues;  State Law, Arbitration, etc., Indemnity

In summary, we would have to make significant revisions to this form and it would end up looking much more like our form.  I don't know the dynamics of the relationship.  Are they insistent on using their paper?

FYI.  Here's a note I sent to the large customers.  Have spoken with them since.  They are going to write a nasty letter in response to Angelides.  Also, it does not appear that the PUC can act at this meeting on the retroactivity issue--appears that due process/notice requirements prevents it.  We're double checking to make sure.

I just got back from the greenhouse gas meeting.  The meeting was good. But you will be retired before that program is worth anything as far as a good trading program is concerned. 

<NAME/>, said he talked with you on the phone about the b-plan.  I added a table of contents, and if <NAME/> gives me anything to add I will.

I am going home (LA) tomorrow so I might work half a day.

<NAME/>, I have this outstanding bill notice which I keep getting form iPayit.  There are about 5 invoices from Argent for EOTT work which they did in 2001. It was for the Midland EOTT compliance stuff. I dont know how to let the system know that these invoices have been taken care of.  Is there someone you know of who can let iPayit know that these invoices have been taken care of?

I would like to have a meeting today at 4pm to review the work that West Power URM has been working on to compare the economic impact of the 4 alternatives.  

It would also be good to get any other feedback from the meetings with SCE and other relevant activities.

I will ask my assistant <NAME/> Noske to get a call in number and a room on 47.

A lot of ex-<NAME/> folks who use your website were involved in this year's <NAME/> Elementary School adoption program.

It didn't occur to me until seeing <NAME/>'s message that we might have a hole in communications with <NAME/> being out on an extended basis.

As I alluded to in my note yesterday, <NAME/> has received a commitment for $1 billion in additional credit from our agent banks. This is great news, more from a market perception standpoint than an actual cash need. You can be assured that senior management is totally focused on the need to shore up the balance sheet with additional equity, now that we have the debt in place, but the equity we be a longer process.

In the meantime, lets get back to work. I would encourage people to talk to their supervisors about this situation if you feel "angst".

Following up on our conversation re: Red Lake storage

assuming only a Phoenix lateral gets built off TW, no mainline or SJ expansion:
	Capital cost is estimated at $304mm.

A fully subscribed rate on volume of 750,000/d to get a 15% ROR would be $.152/MMBtu (with zero fuel retention).

If we assume a more gradual volume ramping up, beginning with 50% load factor in year 1 climbing to 100% in year 8, the target transport rate would need to be $.248 (closer to my "top of the head" $.30 we discussed yesterday).

Both of these scenarios assume 80/20 Debt/equity and a salvage value in year 20 of the project equal to 1/3 of the capital cost.

Also,
regarding the Kern <NAME/> expansion, what might the likelihood be of Mojave receiving Kern gas and backhauling to TW for delivery into Aquila Red Lake?  If the Kern volume of 700,000 (out of 900,000 capacity) doesn't go to Calif end-users, I think Mojave will have a somewhat stranded segment from Cal border to the Kern interconnect.  We could then take this gas and haul it to Phoenix.  

Let me know what you think

<NAME/>--
	per our conversation this morning, attached is the original project open season announcement from August 2001.  A couple of current changes are:

Volume to Phoenix market - 750,000 MMBtu/d
Volume to Cal Border     -  30,000
San <NAME/> receipts		 - 780,000

Projected rate to Phoenix - $0.45/MMBtu

We are also offering 16 hour peaking capability (max daily quantity available in 16 hours, not 24)
and pressure guarantees to those FT customers directly connected to the system (which doesn't help Bowie but may help you somewhere else).

Please don't hesitate to call me with any questions.

A couple of thoughts

-  Per travelocity Lufthansa does fly between <NAME/>-Frankfurt-<NAME/> Ata & then Moscow-Frankfurt-IAH.  We'd only have to take
Transaero one way from <NAME/> ata to Moscow.

- If we fly through Moscow on way to Kaz, keep in mind that the airport we fly into Moscow will be a totally different airport than the airport we fly from Moscow to Kaz (the regional airport).  I have heard that the regional airport is not a very safe or American friendly place.

- I want to me flexible on travel.  But, I'd really, really rather not fly on Aeroflot.

Big ticket item on here is the group dinner in Dallas for the ASE.  I can view the entry and can click on attendees - but only see a list of 10 or 12 attendees.  There were 30 or so, plus <NAME/> Piper and <NAME/> Petruska.  I am missing a second page of attendees, or were only a few listed?  If I am not missing a page, please ask <NAME/> to include the complete list of attendees (all who were at the ASE plus <NAME/> and <NAME/>).  A $4,000 meal for 10 attendees looks funny.  There were many more in attendance.  The cost of the meal makes more sense with a complete list of attendees.  Thanks.

TO:  All EGM and EIM employees affected
FROM: <NAME/> Beck, Managing Director of ENW-Global Risk Management Operations

Last fall, the <NAME/> Wholesale Services organization was created and announced in an organizational memo from <NAME/> Skilling.  All wholesale companies (<NAME/> Americas, <NAME/> Europe, <NAME/> Global Markets and <NAME/> Industrial Markets) plus <NAME/> Net Works and <NAME/> Global Assets were included in the <NAME/> Wholesale Services umbrella.  In that organizational memo, the Energy Operations team (now Global Risk Management Operations) was moved into <NAME/> Net Works to align our operational services, information technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality services to <NAME/> wholesale customers.  This alignment also positions us to evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as well.  With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations teams that support each of the wholesale businesses.

Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we wait until January 1, 2001 to move employees under <NAME/> Net Works.  Senior management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to <NAME/> Networks.  Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks did not get fully executed.  

To correct this, effective April 01, 2001, all EGM and EIM  employees  and non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately report in to <NAME/> Price and <NAME/> Herod, respectively, will be transferred to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under  company 083E.   Starting April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping purposes.  This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' structure.

There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to <NAME/> Net Works. Because you are transferring between <NAME/> payroll companies, IRS requirements state that FICA withholding must start over.  This applies only to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,400.00 for 2001.  Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does not start over but continues as usual.

The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you on your 2001 tax return as withholding.  Therefore, to alleviate the burden of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding.  Be sure to ask your tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes.  You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-5555 to assist you with any questions.  

We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best practices that can positively impact all teams.  If you have questions, please call the HR representative who supports your organization, as identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is dedicated:  

Business Unit	HR Contact	Phone#
EGM 	<NAME/> Hill	713/853-4218
EIM	<NAME/> <NAME/>	713/345-7803
EA/Global Services	<NAME/> De <NAME/>	713/345-3662

Certainly if you feel more comfortable staying at a hotel, you should do what you think is best for you.  We will just be happy to have you with us for whatever time you feel is right for you.   My reaction last night was simply shock, because we had never discussed your staying at a hotel during this visit.  And your lead in to the conversation with "you know we are staying at a hotel...", was such a surprise.  Yes, you stayed at a hotel when you were here for Thanksgiving, but that was with <NAME/>, <NAME/>, Brigeda, <NAME/> and <NAME/> staying in our home as well.  With just the two of you, and since you had said nothing to the contrary, I assumed that you would be in our home.  

What you couldn't know, of course, is the caring time that I have taken over the last several weeks to complete a refresh of the guest room, all with the timing based on having it ready for the two you for this weekend.  But it was this special effort for your visit that made it particularly surprising and then disappointing to me that you will stay at a hotel.  I had it down to the details of new hangers for the closet, a real bed instead of just a frame, I ironed sheets on Sunday night (something that I never do for us!) and have my framer on a tight turn-around on reframing some family pictures to complete a wall in the guest room.  Certainly other guests can enjoy these things, too, but my timing on everything was to make the room even more comfortable and complete for you by the time of your visit. 

I have certainly gotten comfortable today with the idea that you will stay in the hotel, and again, whatever is best for you.  Sounds as if we should make that the "norm" from this point forward, and then expectations will be set ahead of time for everyone.  

I do hope that you can come in time for lunch on Friday.  I am planning to take the day off from work, and the plan was that <NAME/> would join us so that the four of us could have lunch at Champions.  <NAME/> has taken some office space near Champions, and we had planned to show you that as well.  Then we can rest (you can to do that at the hotel, if that is better for you), before having our nails done at 4:00.  But again, whatever works best for you.  Just let us know.  --<NAME/>

USA: UPDATE 1-PG&E utility gives Calpine debt priority status.

07/06/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement) 
SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million for power already sold.
Calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the announcement. 
As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under the contracts, will be elevated to "administrative priority status," a claim which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors. 
Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now, Calpine said. 
The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state with a series of rolling blackouts. 
Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's power plants are qualifying facilities. These types of facilities represent more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities. 
"Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these affordable and reliable energy resources," Calpine senior vice president <NAME/> Macias said in a statement.

<NAME/>:

Here's our assessment of Wright's performance in California.

On the plus side:
He is generally pro-business, and has opposed bills that threaten economic growth, e.g., he opposed the windfall profits, and related, bills.
He sided with the California Assembly Republicans to craft an alternative to the "MOU" for <NAME/> that included direct access as a core feature of any MOU.
His decision to work with the Republicans helped move the political "center of gravity"--albeit marginally--more favorably toward direct access in California.

On the negative side: 
In each and every case that <NAME/> has had to make a choice between the market, customers and competition on the one hand, and the utility on the other, he has never waivered in his decision--he always put the utility first.
Here are three examples (and there are more):  
1) 	During this extraordinary session, he sponsored a bill that would have explicitly created a "stranded cost charge" for utilities. 	Yet by most accounts, Californians have already paid off the utilties' stranded costs.  How many times must Californians pay? 	We worked with consumer and business 	groups to oppose the bill.
2)	In the "alternative MOU" that <NAME/> worked on with Republicans, the Replicans told us that <NAME/> insisted on suspending Direct 	Access until January 1, 2003--a demand that most believe originated with <NAME/>.
3)	<NAME/> sponsored a bill two years ago that would prevent any market participant other than the utilities to provide metering and 	billing services.  Today, this issue is less important to us, but it was very important to us at the time, and <NAME/> remained 	unswervingly in the utilities' camp, despite our efforts.

<NAME/> this helps.  If you need any other information, just let me know.  

Best,
<NAME/>

Please remember that once a master has been executed the status SHOULD NEVER be changed from its "executed" status.  To accomodate the master upgrades and master netting agreements I have added additional selections to the status bar, so you now have the following selections to choose within the "executed" status bar:

1.  "executed"
2.  "executed-under amendment" - to be used when we are amending a master
3.  "executed-inactive" - to be used when a master is executed but we are no longer trading under it
4.  "executed-master upgrade" - to be used when we are doing an ISDA replacement master or replacing one master with another master
5.  "executed-master netting agreement" - to be used when we have a master in place and we are upgrading it to add a master netting agreement

Thanks for your attention herewith.

**********************************************************************************
"The Administration does not project that the State will need to make additional State loans to support the DWR Power Supply Program even if DWR does not issue its revenue bonds as planned during the 2001-02 fiscal year. DWR projects that its funds on hand at the date of this Official Statement and projected revenues appear to be sufficient to finance the Power Supply Program. The cash needs of the Power Supply Program depend, among other things, on future power purchase costs, the timing and amount of revenues from power sales, the availability of additional interim loans, and the timing of the issuance of revenue bonds by DWR. The Power Supply Act limits loans and advances from the State under the Power Supply Act after November 15, 2001, to amounts required for short-term cash flow purposes of no more than $500 million in the aggregate and requires repayment within 180 days. However, the Governor has the power under the Emergency Services Act to order additional loans or other advances to DWR if needed to further mitigate the emergency.

	The State expects to maintain adequate cash reserves to fund its normal operations during the 2001-02 fiscal year whether or not DWR repays the State loans during the fiscal year. The State plans to issue short-term notes to assure that adequate cash balances are maintained. The State has regularly issued short-term debt in the past to meet its cash flow needs. See 'State Indebtedness-Cash Flow Borrowings.'"

I think that your Phibro card is from our original meeting in New York, a lifetime or two ago!!  

Sounds as if your rollercoaster experience with <NAME/> was perhaps a preview of the subsequent weeks at <NAME/>.  Thank goodness for those little guys to go home to every night.  

My little guys aren't so little any more.  <NAME/> is a senior this year - had all of her college applications submitted by November 1, and feels pretty good just knowing that her part is done.  She has gotten one acceptance - University of Oklahoma.  She also applied to UT, SMU and TCU and is waiting to hear from them.  She may hear from SMU and TCU before Christmas - UT probably after the first of the year.  (By the way, <NAME/> and I are strongly talking up the state school thing, given the current <NAME/> share price, or diminished portion thereof.)  This senior year is going by all too quickly, especially since the last month or so I seem to be hearing about it second-hand having spent way too many hours in the <NAME/> Building.

And mentioning the building, I moved to <NAME/> Center South (the new building) in mid September.  I'm on the 4th floor - one of the trading floors.  Kinneman is on this floor, too.  Kind of a cool building, but weird because it is not really finished.  Our floor is fine, but you have to walk through a maze of temporary walls on the second floor to get to the elevator - and some elevators are "panelled" with rough plywood inside.   The sky ring thing is cool, too, but half of the circle is closed on a daily basis as they continue to finish out the space.  We walk under open ceilings with wires hanging down.  Not exactly sure how we were able to swing an occupancy certificate, but we are here!  

Do let me know if you are going to be in <NAME/> anytime soon.  I would love to get together with you.  Between 9/11 and our current cash constraints,  my previously planned November London visit is not happening!  

Enjoy your Thanksgiving in London.  --<NAME/>

There is alot of noise in the media to find some customers who will state for the public record that they will be harmed by the retroactive suspension of DA.

Any luck?  <NAME/> Denne with PR is getting quite a few phone calls from California media sources.

I need to send this to <NAME/> and <NAME/> and get it back agreed to before we can actually fund otherwise I am not comfortable with the agreement and the reps we are making. 


The following representations (among others) have been made to various parties relative to both the credit agreement (with the banks) and the Preferred Stock Agreeement (Dynegy) to the Boards of Transwestern (TW), Northern (NNG) and <NAME/> Transportation Services (ETSC) and it subsidiaries, as well as to Dynegy and the banks:

The funds that are being loaned out of NNG and TW to various entities and the further loans of these funds to <NAME/> will carry <NAME/> Corp guaranties.
The note agreements will reimburse NNG, TW and ETSC and their subsidiaries for their actual expenses associated with these endeavors.
The credit agreements actually require a large degree of separateness and an arm's length standard needs to be applied to dealings between ETSC and its subsidiaries and <NAME/> and the rest of it's subsidiaries.

Before the funding under the credit agreement takes place I would like to make sure that you two are aware of this, have agreed to and understand the conditions and further agree that you will assist me in cleaning up whatever documentation needs to be cleaned up between <NAME/> and ETSC and it's subs to make the above representations not be false.

<NAME/>, can you add the cash and rest of month price for <NAME/> Hub onto your daily pricing sheet. I think the cash to futures spreads for pretty relevant in today's market place as the cash market continues to trade well below futures.

<NAME/> Tholt called Dynegy because of the .12 cent spread between SJ EOL and SJ ICE.  The Trader at Dynegy said that they were busy training two schedulers to trade cash, and that arbing the market was not the message they wanted to send to them.  They would like to focus on the "Big Picture" instead.  

We tried.

<NAME/> and Philippe

Having listened to the DealBench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with <NAME/>, I would like to propose the following with respect to DealBench and EnronOnline:

1). The most valuable pieces of business functionality DealBench has are the data rooms and auctions. The first might have some going concern value, but probably not much, as IntraLinks, the king, only generates $10MM in revs per year. The second, auctions, while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business.

2). The technology as a whole is not severable right now, and probably not ready for prime time. Thus the chances of getting a bid for it as IPR that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal. We have some knowledge of this from our Offline experiences.


Recommendation:

EnronOnline's auction functionality is very thin. DealBench's has a lot of good business logic built into it. While the code might not be up to our standards, it would be of value to integrate it into the EnronOnline platform. This way we take advantage of the superior EnronOnline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned. There will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the DealBench auctions piece to accommodate the single EnronOnline login, as well as change the look and feel to an EnronOnline one, but this should be well worth it. It is my STRONG belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that EnronOnline should OWN. As a part of this move we should re-deploy DealBench's auction marketing force to attack this space, which furthers the general commercial goals of ENE, as opposed to something that now is fringe at best.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

<NAME/>:
Here's an email and slightly modified PP presentation that I'd like to send to <NAME/>.  Let me know what you think.

Best,
<NAME/>

*********************************************************************************************************************************

Hi <NAME/>:

	Congratulations again on your new role at Anaheim.  <NAME/> tells me that you're having a great time.

	Thanks for taking the time to talk a little bit about the strategic alliances <NAME/> is forming with public power.	We're excited about our alliance model because it offers a true win-win for municipal power companies and their customers.  I've attached a power point presentation that provides an overview of the program.  

	In sum, the initiative offers public power systems leading edge competitive retail energy and risk management products and services for their commercial and industrial electric customers, using their own brand name.  Since EES retains and manages all price and product related risks, our alliance partners are freed up to offer their customers valuable and sought after products and services with no additional risk.

Here are some of the program's highlights:

Enabling our alliance partners to provide their customers with products and services that are superior to what competitive suppliers are offering, reaffirming the value of public power and a strong customer focus.

Our alliance partners maintain exclusive control over customer relationships and continue to market power under their own name. 

Our market-tested and accepted products and services allow your customers to better manage costs, reduce operational and financial risks and focus on their core business activities

Our alliance partners do not take on any price risk related to these products.

Products and services customization further enable our alliance partners to spur economic development and maintain customer retention.

Innovative financial solutions that allow companies to upgrade industrial facilities and energy infrastructure, including energy consuming equipment and demand-side management programs, without diverting capital from their core businesses. 

	Thanks again for taking the time to talk yesterday.  If you have any questions, give me a call at 415.782.7822, and I'll call you in the next few days about arranging a time that we can meet with you in beautiful Southern California.

All the best,
<NAME/>

I don't think that is true.  Our waiver does contemplate such a release of claims.  I think we should not comment on legal questions and let the terms of our plan and the separation agreements speak for themselves.

In addition, make sure we understand the steam obligation and it's effect on dispatch flexibity and heat rate.  It appears the 8000 Heat Rate is assuming above market steam sales are buying down the heat rate.   Solar turbines in combined cycle (without a steam sale credit) would usually have a heat rate around 10,000 Btu/kwh.

The lower heat rate is probably predicated on providing 24 hour steam, which means less dispatch flexibility and producing off-peak energy at a loss.

Make sure we are modeling these dynamics properly.

I may have zapped some of these updates from <NAME/> since he has started this.  May be good in our budget review meeting on Monday with <NAME/> to have all of these updates in hand - and any documentation that you all may have kept on performance issues prior to <NAME/> starting this update process - as back up for maintenance and capital dollars to be spent on Unify in 2002 to improve performance and reliability.  Can one of you get all of these updates?  Thanks. --<NAME/>

I have a customer in town Thursday night, so we will be taking him out to dinner, than to the Nuggets game.  I still want, and I'm planning, to go to the concert on Friday night, so don't count me out.  We will have to do dinner some other time.  Make sure we talk on Friday because I have an open house from 3:00 to 6:00, and I'll start drinking and forget the plans.  How is everything else going.  I had a GREAT time on Saturday night, so I hope you did also.

This is it.  It should be self explanatory.  There are values for Jan02 and Feb02 in the file.  The value increased a little more than I expected.  I didn't have time to compare the numbers from my last run at it in December.  I will in the morning.  I also still need to find the true value on the weather deal.
