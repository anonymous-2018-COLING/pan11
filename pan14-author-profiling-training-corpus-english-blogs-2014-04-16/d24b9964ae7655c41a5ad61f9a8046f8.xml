Since I've been SAHM'ing, I've been a little.... lost? I don't necessarily "define" myself as a working-mom, but I have been working for a long time. The adjustment to being a full-time, at home parent has been jarring, honestly. Not bad, mind you, just.... different. I definitely enjoy the face time with the kids, and - DEFINITELY - the freeeeee time I have, now that the kids are back at school.<br /><br />But for the first time in ages, I'm not really on a schedule, besides Gab's school schedule. I have so much free time, I kind of get overwhelmed and freeze because I don't know what to do with it all. That sure sounds like crazypeople talk.<br /><br />Anyway, with all this freeeeeee time, you'd think I could at least be running some decent miles. AND YET.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-753RiZm5Cjo/UkkMAue3-gI/AAAAAAAAEuw/oehY6bTHV7M/s1600/daily+mile.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="157" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-753RiZm5Cjo/UkkMAue3-gI/AAAAAAAAEuw/oehY6bTHV7M/s400/daily+mile.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This is what lazyass looks like</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div>I'm partially convinced that my problem is that I had no races coming up - #1's cross country scheduling made fall plans mighty tricky for racing - so I've picked a December half, and start training..... Monday. Whee.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>With that, I guess, Plan for the Week is making a comeback!</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Monday</b>: 3 mi easy, XT</div><div><b>Tuesday</b>: 6 mi, speed</div><div><b>Wednesday</b>: XT</div><div><b>Thursday</b>: 5 easy</div><div><b>Friday</b>: 8 (with middle miles race pace), XT</div><div><b>Saturday</b>: rest</div><div><b>Sunday</b>: 3 easy or rest</div><div><br /></div><div>I have kept up on the video trifecta (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUychjqfO8I" target="_blank">Tank Top Arms</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1919eTCoESo" target="_blank">Core</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X663kXIufZI" target="_blank">Glutes/Thighs</a>), so at least there's that? (And, ps, I DO have muscle in my arms, and and AND I did full pushups - not on my knees - so I guess those videos do work....).</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>In other news....</div><div><br /></div><div>As I said, #1 joined cross country at her high school, and is busy being <i><b>so fast</b></i>. They train hard, they train a LOT, and she's made amazing improvements already. When she started going to camp, her 5k time on July 4th was 24:xx (her 5k PR from Chapman 2011 was 22:08). At an invitational last weekend, she came in sub-20 in a 3 mile race.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I would probably puke, if I didn't die first.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't want to brag (lie), but she's killing it - she's already been asked to run varsity, and I'm really excited to watch the rest of her season. Which races every single weekend. All of the weekends. All over Southern California.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Every weekend.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Excitingly, #2 has expressed an interest in going running, too, so I am hoping to log some easy miles with her this week.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>And Gab has been accompanying us to some of the races, and mostly spends her time being like this.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/601568_10201094657541889_1704427476_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/601568_10201094657541889_1704427476_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Grass Angels?&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>And in non-kid news, remember my infatuation with <a href="http://365awesomedays.blogspot.com/2012/02/dear-evan-dando-we-need-to-talk.html" target="_blank">Evan Dando</a> <a href="http://365awesomedays.blogspot.com/2012/03/knoxville-city-of-dreams-also-pftw.html" target="_blank">last year</a>?

Gab insisted she felt fine - I'm not sure how I feel about that. Did she <i>really </i>feel fine? Was she so used to being uncomfortable that a little sore throat didn't even register? Did she think it was just... normal?<br /><br />Who knows. I guess we'll figure it out in time.<br /><br />Over the summer, we also had some cognitive testing done on her - the chemo treatments she received are known to cause cognitive issues, and we had some concerns. She came away from the testing with an "Unspecified Cognitive Disorder" - basically, something is off, but she's so young, it's hard to say what specifically it is. It's something we'll have to keep watching as she continues in school, and re-test as we go.<br /><br />The last six months have been quiet, but I'm not sure that it will ever be "easy". I'm consistently on guard, watching for anything that's "off".<br /><br />But - just like during her treatment - she's just a normal kid. She plays with My Little Pony, she is obsessed with dinosaurs (<a href="http://365awesomedays.blogspot.com/2013/04/dinosaur-party-team-gab-notvirtual.html" target="_blank">still</a>), she picks up every single leaf she finds when we take a walk.<br /><br />I have said this a million times, through diagnosis and treatment, but we are so, so lucky. We are lucky that she has such an optimistic attitude, that nothing phases her. We are lucky that she is the kid she is. We are lucky that we had the access to the care we did, and that it worked for her.<br /><br />Today, she started first grade.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

While I was running Disneyland 10k, #1 was running her first cross country event. Okay, not REALLY, it was just team time trials.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-P3xOYdTlrd4/UigPEJI6WQI/AAAAAAAAEqE/DA8caX36P4w/s1600/time+trials.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-P3xOYdTlrd4/UigPEJI6WQI/AAAAAAAAEqE/DA8caX36P4w/s400/time+trials.JPG" width="125" /></a></div>She finished in 20:55, 9th place overall female. Since she has pretty much taken a MAJOR break since camp ended in the beginning of August, that's an excellent time. She's so fast! School finally starts for her next week, with her first real meet on the 14th - I'm psyched to see what she can accomplish with some real training.<br /><br />2. Last week, I ran 3 miles Friday, 6.2 Saturday, 13.1 Sunday, and then decided following that with a 10 mile trail run on Monday would be the best idea ever.<br /><br />It really was!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SzBs33F--1g/UigR2fKzvaI/AAAAAAAAEqQ/pq933cSkwl0/s1600/1240207_10200935958814520_2043125028_n+(1).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SzBs33F--1g/UigR2fKzvaI/AAAAAAAAEqQ/pq933cSkwl0/s320/1240207_10200935958814520_2043125028_n+(1).jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />It was a beautiful morning - we left super early, and did 10 easy pace miles around Crystal Cove.<br /><br />Ages ago, I went on a naturalist-led hike in an adjacent park, where the ranger said that there are no mountain lions south of the toll roads (because, DUH, animals know they belong north of the toll roads...). But that paw print was 1. not a dog, and 2. GIGANTOR. It's either a mountain lion, or a dinosaur. Either one, I won't be running that trail alone again for awhile...<br /><br /><br />3. I feel a little silly recapping the Disneyland Half, since I've done it three years in a row. So here are the pictures, and you can just imagine the caption for all of them being, "THIS IS THE MOST FUN EVER!".<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9kKR1cS5H3M/UigTLQ_iUdI/AAAAAAAAEqc/Wrg-0L_yFCw/s1600/019.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9kKR1cS5H3M/UigTLQ_iUdI/AAAAAAAAEqc/Wrg-0L_yFCw/s320/019.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"Where should I stash my needle and thread?"

Blog friend <a href="http://www.runningforbling.com/" target="_blank">Elizabeth from Running for Bling</a> is running <a href="http://www.runningforbling.com/2013/09/running-in-purple-again.html" target="_blank">RnR Nola in February with Team in Training</a>.

So.... the kids are at school. And I'm just.. hanging out. Running, some, cross training, watching an excessive amount of tv, baking.... I don't really know what to do with this nonsense called "free time". I woke up and kind of wanted to run today, but it was a rest day.<br /><br />I don't even have anything on my race calendar right now, besides Tink in JANUARY.<br /><br />What?! I don't even recognize myself any more.<br /><br />If ever I were going to train for another marathon, I suppose now would be a good time, since I seem to have ALL THE FREE HOURS EVER. I previously intended to add Paso Robles Marathon to my calendar, but with me being unemployed, it feels like kind of a jackass thing to do right now - spending a weekend away chasing a race. I've kind of checked out local races, but I'm just not really feeling them. Well, the exception to that is Carlsbad, which I'd LOVE to do, but it interferes with Tink. Womp.<br /><br />Anyway. That was a lot of words to say I'm kind of bored?<br /><br />But I have perfected a banana muffin recipe, so at least there's that.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HigAba2UD7Y/UjH10l065_I/AAAAAAAAEuQ/kKHUVuRj5WU/s1600/971902_10200785595455530_1422547718_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HigAba2UD7Y/UjH10l065_I/AAAAAAAAEuQ/kKHUVuRj5WU/s320/971902_10200785595455530_1422547718_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>If you want to drop by....

Something that I should mention, <a href="http://365awesomedays.blogspot.com/2013/10/on-being-accidental-stay-at-home-mom.html" target="_blank">related to yesterday's post</a>, is that the point of the blog post, as I read it, is that Matt Walsh is a jerkface. One thing that I don't need is a guy running his yapper in defense of my choices.<br /><br />For realsies, though, I don't begrudge anyone else their decision to stay at home or work - I am okay at playing this game with school-age kids, but I would have LOST my mind with smaller kids. The good thing about this gig, though, is I really like cooking and baking and I get to do a lot of that? It's just not as simple as he says, that having a mom at home is the best, the end. I wish people would acknowledge that more often, and spend less time selling the SAHM bill.<br /><br /><br />2. The lack of doing any real stuff is why I haven't been blogging much. There's just not much to say, when I'm not scrambling around to fit in all of the mom stuff around work, and when I have no work stuff to complain about.<br /><br /><br />3. I've got the Marathon Itch. FINALLY! I've been hesitant to get too ambitious and register for anything when I'm juuuuuuust finding my running groove again, but now I am antsy to start 18 and 20 mile weekends again.<br /><br />28 Reasons Why Training for a Marathon is the Worst Thing Ever.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr06/9/0/anigif_enhanced-buzz-5368-1381294006-7.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="163" src="http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr06/9/0/anigif_enhanced-buzz-5368-1381294006-7.gif" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Except that you are ravenous all the time so you’re not actually getting in shape. Yep.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />4. #1 is running with Varsity for the first time this weekend! She's been sick the last few races - last weekend, she was not too far off of her PR, so I'm excited to see how she performs this weekend.<br /><br /><br />5.

We did an easy 2:1 run/walk ratio, trying to teach her to paaace herself. She's a great sprinter, but then blows up early. She had a lot of smack to talk during the early intervals. By the last one, she was begging to walk. HAHAHAHA.<br /><br /><b>Tuesday </b>- easy 5<br />Nothing exciting. Easy 5 miles with random strides.<br /><br /><b>Wednesday </b>- cross training<br />Tank Top Arms, core, vinyasa flow yoga.<br /><br /><b>Thursday </b>- long run<br />Weather was cool and overcast - easy 8 miles outside, steady pace with slight negative splits.<br /><br /><b>Friday </b>- cross training<br />Repeat of Wednesday.<br /><br /><b>Saturday </b>- rest<br />Spent the day out with the family.<br /><br /><b>Sunday </b>- speeeeed<br />3x1600. Gross. Goal pace was 8:45-9, actual was 9:02, 8:56, 8:49. Challenging, but not the worst ever.<br /><br />Total: 21 miles.<br /><br />21 miles seems to be my happy spot - I feel fine, nothing feels like it needs extra recovery, all of the runs were manageable, I'm not dying of runger. So far, the Jerk Shin has behaved nicely, but I'm assuming it will resume its jerkiness as I add miles.<br /><br />Someone asked last week about what training plan I'm using - I built my own based partially on the Train Like a Mother book, and Run Less, Run Faster. I don't like running 5 times a week, like TLAM suggests, but I'm willing to give it a shot to see how it works as the weeks progress. If they're easy miles, it could be fine - especially since I have plenty of free time. BUT, I have supplemented my fall/winter schedule with a few shorter distance races, so I've pulled some of the speed workouts from RLRF to keep building speed - I just can't do the All Speed, All The Time RLRF program, it doesn't work for my janky legs. Eh. We'll see how it goes. The nice thing about making your own isht up, is you can change whatever you feel like changing. <br /><br /><br />This week, #1 races on Thursday instead of Saturday, so I may move things around. Or not. I don't know. OH, and also, Tuesday is OC Run Club night, so that may be shifting things around, too. I'll figure it out as I go, I guess....<br /><br /><b>Monday</b>: easy 2-3 miles, XT<br /><b>Tuesday</b>: tempo (ick), 5 miles<br /><b>Wednesday</b>: XT<br /><b>Thursday</b>: 6 miles, easy<br /><b>Friday</b>: XT<br /><b>Saturday</b>: Long - 10 miles<br /><b>Sunday</b>: rest<br /><br />***********************************************************************<br /><br />On Saturday, we headed up to Yucaipa for the Yucaipa Cross Country Invitational.<br /><br />The course has one "nice hill" at the end of the first mile....<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/559848_750849038263352_2058947505_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/559848_750849038263352_2058947505_n.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />which #1 used to pass everyone.

I can't wait for the recap.<br /><br />*******************************************************************<br />Last week....<br /><br /><b>Monday</b>: XT<br />Tank Top Arms, Core<br /><br /><b>Tuesday</b>: Arms?<br />Ages ago, the passenger window in my van stopped working. I would always say that it wasn't that big of a deal (until it was really hot in the summer and I wished I could roll it down, because -ahem- the AC also doesn't work), because at least it was UP and not down.<br /><br />And then, about a month ago, it ROLLED DOWN, all by itself. And wouldn't go back up.<br /><br />So for a few weeks, it was fine, because our weather is nice, and since I'm not commuting, I don't drive too often.<br /><br />But then there was finally rain in our forecast last week, so.... we googled the problem, purchased a part (a new motor for the windows), and did this...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Qd6HTRPf5Rg/Ult1tPZ_pnI/AAAAAAAAEv4/NOfArnga1Qc/s1600/1379246_10201157547314094_1479365831_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Qd6HTRPf5Rg/Ult1tPZ_pnI/AAAAAAAAEv4/NOfArnga1Qc/s320/1379246_10201157547314094_1479365831_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>And now it works, and I fixed it just in time to NOT soak the inside of my van. It was fairly easy - definitely easy enough that I feel dumb for waiting so long to do it :D. Anyway, my arms were EXHAUSTED after doing this, so I called it cross training, lol.<br /><br /><b>Wednesday</b>: Tempo<br />5 miles, 3 at tempo. Goal pace was 9:25-9:11, actual 9:12, 9:22, 8:54. It felt hard, but only REALLY hard the last 400m or so. Overall pace 9:39.<br /><br /><b>Thursday</b>: XT<br />Arms, core, and yoga. #1 had an after-school race - her first league meet of the season. It was a tough course, pretty hilly, and she has been struggling to kick a nasty cold. AND YET, she finished 4th place in the freshman/sophomore race, first for her school, at 20:08. Super powers, maybe?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c2A3vPj394g/Ult3uYiajnI/AAAAAAAAEwE/TsriXg5Euz8/s1600/026.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c2A3vPj394g/Ult3uYiajnI/AAAAAAAAEwE/TsriXg5Euz8/s320/026.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>While I certainly enjoy watching the races, these events are draining - they last FOREVER. FOREVER. This one was not so bad, because there were only 6 races I think, but they were 30 minutes apart, so it just goes on and on. At least it was pretty?<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LXIbzyw05Bs/Ult4GhDqgzI/AAAAAAAAEwM/Kl-klJRzgRE/s1600/1395288_10201164948579121_865683889_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LXIbzyw05Bs/Ult4GhDqgzI/AAAAAAAAEwM/Kl-klJRzgRE/s320/1395288_10201164948579121_865683889_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">It's FALL. See?</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><b>Friday</b>: Rest!<br />It was Gab's birthday, so I spent hours making a BRIGHT-ASS purple cake with neon pink frosting. I have no idea what came over me, but it was ridiculous.<br /><br /><b>Saturday</b>: Easy<br />6 miles strides - did this one on the treadmill, and ran fast-ish pace during commercials. Overall pace 9:55.<br /><br /><b>Sunday</b>: Long<br />10 miles - I ran a local route, with the first half on some hilly trails, and second half on roads (well, sidewalks). H came with me, and we had a lovely run. AND, it was faaaast (for me!). Average pace was 10:13 - the last time we did this route, my average pace was 10:54. What.<br /><br /><b>Total: 21 miles</b><br /><br />So, I'm intrigued that I really am not running a ton of mileage, but I'm getting some pretty drastic improvements in pace over the last month or so. Maybe there really is something to blah blah strength training...<br /><br /><br />Next week.....<br /><br /><b>Monday</b>: XT<br /><b>Tuesday</b>: Easy 4<br /><b>Wednesday</b>: Long (13)<br /><b>Thursday</b>: XT<br /><b>Friday</b>: 6 with 4 at race pace<br /><b>Saturday</b>: XT? Easy run? #1 has a race, lord knows how long that will take me out....<br /><b>Sunday</b>: Rest!<br /><br /><br /><br />

I let myself stop doing the glutes/thigh video, and THAT WAS DUMB. It's going to be the worst ever when I start doing it again.<br /><br /><b>Tuesday</b>: 4 easy<br />Nothing interesting. Ran 4 outside, easy pace, with negative splits (not on purpose, it just happened that way). 10:13 avg.<br /><br /><b>Wednesday</b>: XT<br />Core, arms, yoga. I also (re)started the 100 pushups program - day one completed.<br /><br /><b>Thursday</b>: 6 miles, speedyish<br />1 mile warm up, 4 at race pace, 1 cool. Hit goal pace just fine. Thought I had an achy hip, but since it didn't bother me when I started running, and didn't bother me after, maybe my brain was faking?<br /><br /><b>Friday</b>: XT<br />Arms, and day 2 of 100 pushups.<br /><br /><b>Saturday</b>: Rest<br />XC spectating, which consisted of an easy hike and some sprinting around the course to watch #1 race.<br /><br /><b>Sunday</b>: Long!<br />13 easy miles - 12 easy pace, last mile at race pace.

Her PR is from a month ago, on a flat course, in cool weather. This was a hilly course on a warm day.<br /><br />It was an interesting experience - moving from the freshman/sophomore races up to a varsity sweepstakes race means that her previously impressive placing was no longer... well, it was just not great in the field she raced against. It was - for her - a great race individually. It's a much more strategic race when those kids are involved - so it'll be fun to see how she picks up on this, if she takes the coaching from her teammates, and what she does with it.<br /><br />We had to be at the park so, so early (6:15, what!).... the moon was up, but the sun wasn't..<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Fb9DTo-9EPo/UmS1B4XqmUI/AAAAAAAAExE/89x9APLnWyY/s1600/sun.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Fb9DTo-9EPo/UmS1B4XqmUI/AAAAAAAAExE/89x9APLnWyY/s320/sun.JPG" width="201" /></a></div><br />We spent a few hours hiking around...<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NvXdFUaCoPw/UmS1HUZdoEI/AAAAAAAAExM/XMqsjtUOzIk/s1600/002.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NvXdFUaCoPw/UmS1HUZdoEI/AAAAAAAAExM/XMqsjtUOzIk/s320/002.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V_F1P6mSP6U/UmS1Ha0IOqI/AAAAAAAAExU/KsYB6K6KLmY/s1600/003.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V_F1P6mSP6U/UmS1Ha0IOqI/AAAAAAAAExU/KsYB6K6KLmY/s320/003.JPG" width="240" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">this is the hill in mile 1 that they had to run up.

Actually, I just don't have a ton of interesting things going on right now (still), so there's not much to share?<br /><br />Last week..... I had a really great training week!<br /><br /><b>Monday</b>: Cross training<br />Tank Top Arms, Core, and pushups. I'm SHOCKED at the improvement in pushups. Fascinating! Did you know, consistency helps?!<br /><br /><b>Tuesday</b>: 4 miles<br />Easy run on the beach path at Crystal Cove.

I was a little concerned, because I ran long on Sunday... but 14 miles, with 5 mid-miles at goal pace. NAILED IT. Goal pace was dead on, and I finished with an overall 10:03 pace - which is my current half PR pace, and it almost killed me dead. It was a great, great run.<br /><br /><b>Thursday</b>: XT<br />Arms and pushups<br /><br /><b>Friday</b>: Easy/XT<br />Core in the morning, then a 6 mile, easy pace, negative split run.<br /><br /><b>Saturday</b>: Rest<br />Actually, I did pushups, but it was only 10 minutes and barely counts.<br /><br /><b>Sunday</b>: Tempo<br />5 miles total, mid 3 at 9:25-9:11. Actual was 9:24, 9:17, 9:14. It was a little tough, but not unbearable.<br /><br />Total: 29 miles. Solid.<br /><br /><br />I finally replaced my poor shoes....

It's a pretty easy gig. I'm probably exceptionally lucky for a few reasons:<br />1. It was financially sketchy, but not a crisis, for me to stay home right now.&nbsp;</div><div>2. My kids are pretty self-sufficient - on purpose, we have made them that way.<br />3. My kids are older - at 14, 12, and 7, they can do a lot of things on their own.<br /><br /><br />So while my circumstances are maybe different than what Matt Walsh is using as reference, I'm still a SAHM*.... and since he asked, THIS is what I did Tuesday:<br /><br /><br />6-6:15 - wake up, roll out of bed, start coffee. H and #1 are already up - she has to be at school at 7, and he has to be at work at 7. He rides his bike, she usually rides mine (unless I'm feeling exceptionally kind and give her a ride). #2 is usually also awake, but she leaves later than they do. Yesterday, this part was REALLY exciting, because I almost started a fire when my coffee maker died a dramatic, smokey death.<br /><br />6:30 - spend a billion minutes trying to drag Gab out of bed. Giving her the top bunk was a terrible plan, she is NOT a morning person. (Unless it's a weekend, then she's up at 6).<br /><br />6:40-7:25 - try to get her to eat breakfast, but she's the slowest moving human ever.<br /><br />7:25-7:55 - drag Gab through teeth brushing, hair styling, getting dressed, and shove her out of the house.<br /><br />7:55-8:30 - walk Gab to school - usually she rides her scooter and I walk with her. #2 comes with us, and walks to school from there. I walk back home with the scooter.<br /><br />8:30-8:45 - consider running outside. It's cool now, but I hate being hot, and the sun is out. Decide to just run and stop thinking about it so hard.<br /><br />8:45-9:30 - quick 4 mile easy run around the neighborhood. Schedule was for 4 easy, and I just made loops until I hit that. Pace felt easy, and I avoided checking the Garmin, but it was negative splits, so that was exciting. Wheeee.<br /><br />9:30-10 - think about how much I want coffee RIGHT NOW, eat some breakfast, drink chocolate milk - a poor substitute :(.<br /><br />10-10:45 - check Amazon for replacement coffee makers. Consider my options, debate if the potential savings is worth waiting for. Decide I must stop at Target to buy a replacement, because I will surely perish without it for 24 hours.<br /><br />10:45-11:30 - read blogs, dick around on twitter/fb/etc. Find reviews of an Evan Dando show last weekend. Think about applying for Amazing Race, and decide that would be CRAZY....<br /><br />11:30-12 - Consider lunch options. I'm feeling lazy (more than usual...), and kind of want to just toss some chicken nuggets in the oven. Briefly consider going out to Souplantation for lunch. Decide I'm not quite that lazy, and make eggs instead - egg whites, ham, a ton of spinach, some cheddar cheese, and then drown all that isht in salsa verde. I've been eating this for weeks.<br /><br />12-12:05 - Complain via text to the H that I wish I had coffee RIGHT NOW. Realize I'm being ridiculous because I am, in fact, doing absolutely nothing, and could just go get some. Then immediately realize that I'm too lazy....<br /><br />12:05-2 - play around on the internet, googling info on #1's XC meet this weekend. Watch TV. Deadliest Catch on Netflix streaming, then the end of an episode of Party of Five on Amazon Plus. Get half-way through before I have to pick up Gabby.<br /><br />2-2:45 - pick up Gab at school, then head to Target to pick out a new coffee maker. THANK GOD. She's also being super adorable, so I buy her a slushie. I'm so nice to her.<br /><br />2:45-3:15 - head to #2's school and wait for her. When she shows up at the car, ask how school was. "Fine." What'd you do? "I don't know. Nothing." She DOES spill that she was invited to a Halloween party, so that's exciting - she's had a little bit of a rough transition to middle school this year, and her BFF moved away a few weeks ago, so I'm really glad to see her excited about something.<br /><br />3:15-5 - get Gab started on homework - 2 math worksheets and reading. Thankfully, this math I can still do, but they use weird words and terminology. I'm not a fan - it is just overly complicated. Look over #2's homework assignments - her teachers post everything online, so I make sure to review it every day, and watch her do it. Otherwise, she will be mysterious and sneaky and not actually do it. This is probably the most exhausting part of my day - chasing down 7th grade homework. Review her grades, and get irritated that she's not turning things in. She's so dang smart and is sabotaging herself. She will never, ever be ungrounded this school year... The H shows up at home around 4:15ish. Says he wants to run, and then kind of hangs out until...<br /><br />5-5:20 - #1 calls and asks to be picked up from cross country practice. The H is really nosey and rides with me so he can ask her a million questions. She was doing 400's - they got through 6, I think?, at an 80sec pace. Laugh inside at the idea of trying that. I would die dead.<br /><br />5:20-6:30 - H finally goes to run. I make dinner - grilled pork chops, baked potatoes, grilled asparagus. It's delicious.<br /><br />6:30-8 - watch tv. I watch a lot of tv.<br /><br />8-8:45 - make lunches for the next day, make more coffee for me (I drink a LOT of coffee), clean up the kitchen.<br /><br />8:45-9 - convince kids to get to bed.<br /><br />9-10:30 - watch tv, some more. It's my expertise.<br /><br /><br />The great thing is, I have every morning free, from 8:30-2 (or 1 if Gab is getting out of school early). Sometimes I cross train, sometimes go grocery shopping, sometimes... nothing at all. It's pretty great.<br /><br />Living the dream....<br /><br /><br /></div>

She came across the finish line with a HUGE smile on her face, and later said she was so happy when she saw her time that she almost cried.<br /><br />The support from her teammates was adorable, and her middle school PE teacher was there, and it was just so, so great. She's struggled a little moving up to varsity, and no longer being the "big fish" in the smaller Freshman pond, so I think this will do good things for her confidence.<br /><br /><br />

The Kid People. You guys, your kids don't belong IN the gym.

Results were posted earlier this week....<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aspvOXe5-aY/UomjI4xNh5I/AAAAAAAAEzE/VFuRwh2XX6k/s1600/results5k.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="317" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aspvOXe5-aY/UomjI4xNh5I/AAAAAAAAEzE/VFuRwh2XX6k/s400/results5k.JPG" width="400" /></a></div>LOL at 7:31 pace.<br /><br />Immediately after, I swore I would be retiring from 5k's forever, because I'd rather run a marathon than sprint for 3.1 miles. But - since this course was shooooooort, I'm kind of thinking I might try a re-do in December at the <a href="http://renegaderaceseries.com/index.php?view=details&amp;id=26%3Asanta-run&amp;option=com_eventlist&amp;Itemid=146" target="_blank">Renegade Santa Run</a>. Based on last year's results, there's an outside shot at an age group placing....<br /><br /><b>Tuesday</b>: Rest?<br /><br /><b>Wednesday</b>: More rest?<br /><br /><b>Thursday</b>: Long run<br />On paper, this run went well. 14 miles total, broken into one hour warm-up, 6 miles at race pace (9:33 for me), and cool down to finish. However, I was MESSED UP. I didn't drink enough, and was sweating a ton, and probably started not-well-hydrated, and by mile 7 or 8, I had a giant headache. I ignored it for awhile, but eventually, any time I tried to drink, I just felt gross and sloshy. Somehow, I also forgot to bring any fuel with me, which is RIDICULOUS, since long runs = salted caramel gu time, so how is that even possible??<br /><br />I was supposed to run 15, but quit at 14. My overall pace was great, and my BODY felt fine, I am just dumb. I didn't go through one bottle of water during the run; after, I drank 3 bottles of Nuun, plus a giant diet coke, and didn't pee for hours and hours and hours. I am not a professional.<br /><br /><b>Friday</b>: 3 easy<br />Weather was beautiful - cool, overcast, a little drizzly - so I did a quick 3 easy from the Target parking lot, before picking up a few things.<br /><br /><b>Saturday</b>: planned off day<br />#1 raced Saturday, more on this below. Her race was mid-afternoon, which is really just the worst time of them all, and it just kills the entirety of the day.<br /><br /><b>Sunday</b>: rest<br />Saturday's spectating beat me down hard.<br /><br /><b>Total: 22 miles</b><br />Zero cross-training. Oops. I just didn't really feel like it - the 5k killed me pretty dead, and so did that long run. Lame. I guess these videos and push-ups are going to be extra terrible this week.<br /><br /><br />This week....<br /><br />I originally planned to start taper this week, buuuuuut *spoiler alert* there's a fair shot of #1's team heading to states the same weekend as the race I wanted to do, but.... I'm doing a higher volume than I initially planned, but nothing craaazy,<i> just in case</i>.<br /><br /><b>Monday</b>: 3-4 easy<br /><b>Tuesday</b>: off<br /><b>Wednesday</b>: 6 strides<br /><b>Thursday</b>: 4 easy<br /><b>Friday</b>: 8-10 easy<br /><b>Saturday</b>: off<br /><b>Sunday</b>: off<br /><br />**********************************************************************<br />XC updates....<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Msd53hjC0QY/UomqZNMcxTI/AAAAAAAAEzo/kTGG6jCBRBY/s1600/945777_569361389799624_945370098_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Msd53hjC0QY/UomqZNMcxTI/AAAAAAAAEzo/kTGG6jCBRBY/s320/945777_569361389799624_945370098_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />#1 ran CIF Southern Section prelims Saturday at Mt.

True to the course, #1 breezed through the first mile well under 6 minutes, because she has super-teleportation-powers.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HoeDmGi3ClY/UomrHYoUwCI/AAAAAAAAEz0/vAoMcfvBN-0/s1600/1000361_776499502364972_935333524_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HoeDmGi3ClY/UomrHYoUwCI/AAAAAAAAEz0/vAoMcfvBN-0/s320/1000361_776499502364972_935333524_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Somewhere on the switchbacks, she lost her teammate - it's a tricky course, and one she was new on.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-maAR2Z7rETY/UomrXwIhAUI/AAAAAAAAEz8/USQ-kZ0Ytmw/s1600/1469906_569362616466168_1627548827_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-maAR2Z7rETY/UomrXwIhAUI/AAAAAAAAEz8/USQ-kZ0Ytmw/s320/1469906_569362616466168_1627548827_n.jpg" width="213" /></a></div><br />Somewhere in here, she started struggling with something in her eyeball. After the race, we saw her coach meet her at the finish line with her bag, frantically digging through it, and I had no idea what was happening. Apparently, she tried to tell her coach she got some funk in her eyeball, and was having trouble seeing/not dying, but the coach thought she was saying she needed her inhaler (she doesn't use an inhaler, lol). I am always a little nervous about the portions of the race where we can't see her, so I am greatly comforted knowing that her coaches are watching out for her too. Awwwww.<br /><br />Anyway. She said she really enjoyed the course (WHAT), so I'm psyched to see them advance and see what happens next weekend. Several of the girls on the team this year are new to Mt Sac, so hopefully this was a good training run for them, in prep for next week, and with some experience on the course, they can really make some strides in their performance.<br /><br />Get it? Strides?<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yxbfIW1Pi6s/UomsbdRVwyI/AAAAAAAAE0I/LAHDUs4O7O8/s1600/1453374_569361403132956_1762790191_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yxbfIW1Pi6s/UomsbdRVwyI/AAAAAAAAE0I/LAHDUs4O7O8/s320/1453374_569361403132956_1762790191_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">adorable.

It's pretty great seeing the girls' enthusiasm and camaraderie.<br /><br />Yaaaaaaay, maybe-Fresno?<br /><br />

I'll be doing this one with the kids.<br /><br /><b>{{For any of the above, you can register using code HEATHERDISCOUNT for 10% off}}</b><br /><br /><br />In addition to those fun events, I have.... these to fill in my calendar:<br /><br />Nov. 11 - <a href="http://www.veteransdayrun.com/run/irvine" target="_blank">Veteran's Day 5k</a>. I stumbled on this last week, and it's down the street from me. I've been wanting to fit in a shorter race to get an idea of my current fitness level, and this is perfect. I'm hoping to PR - my existing PR is 27:47 from <i>last July</i> - but the pace sure seems faaaaast. We'll see?<br /><br /><br />December Half Marathon - I'm waffling between a few options.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lopersclub.org/images/hc-header-2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="148" src="http://www.lopersclub.org/images/hc-header-2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><b>Option 1:</b> <a href="http://www.lopersclub.org/holiday-classic.aspx" target="_blank">Holiday Classic Half</a> - this one is CHEAP, and looks like a ton of fun. I really prefer smaller, more local races, and this one is my top choice, BUT I may have a scheduling conflict this weekend. Maybe. So I'm on hold. The timing of this one is best, because I am ready to race a half RIGHT NOW.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-492FZlwTfpQ/UnuxkPkK_rI/AAAAAAAAEyg/edg3VY1-BS8/s1600/holiday+half.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-492FZlwTfpQ/UnuxkPkK_rI/AAAAAAAAEyg/edg3VY1-BS8/s1600/holiday+half.JPG" /></a></div><br /><b>Option 2:</b> <a href="http://runholidayhalf.com/" target="_blank">Holiday Half Marathon</a> - this one is a <strike>little</strike> lot pricier, because I've been super lazy about registering, plus there are parking fees which irritate me. It's an okay time for me, but I'm not in love with it (probably why I haven't registered yet....)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SE4a1AkEavA/UnuyDJhWE5I/AAAAAAAAEyo/3QrL3TcOe5g/s1600/sdholidayhalf.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SE4a1AkEavA/UnuyDJhWE5I/AAAAAAAAEyo/3QrL3TcOe5g/s1600/sdholidayhalf.JPG" /></a></div><b>Option 3:</b> <a href="http://www.sdholidayhalf.com/4" target="_blank">San Diego Holiday Half Marathon</a> - this one is reasonably priced (there are discount codes floating around), and <a href="https://twitter.com/shann582" target="_blank">Shannon</a> will be there, which is a big selling point! But, it's inaugural, and that makes me nervous. This is the furthest out, so I'd have more time to train, BUT it's the furthest out, so there's more time to train.....<br /><br />Anyway. I'm waffling.<br /><br />Of course, there's also <a href="http://www.rundisney.com/tinker-bell-half-marathon/" target="_blank">Tinker Bell Half</a> in January (!!!!), and a potential March marathon - 2 weeks before the ultra, so it would be a good last training run. I feel like I could pull out a giant marathon PR, so I'm considering <a href="http://dvlrun.com/" target="_blank">Diamond Valley Lake Marathon</a> in early March. Looks like a potentially boring course, but my options seem to be pretty limited (unless I go with Surf City, which I'm not excited about AT ALL).<br /><br /><br />PLUS..... I'm also on the hunt, KIND OF, for a racecation.... maybe?<br /><br />Phew. That was a lot of race talk.<br /><br />What's on your calendar?

I just wasn't excited about it. It's not super great for PR'ing, and I didn't want to shell out the money for a fun run (for whatever reason, this race is far more expensive than any others in December). I picked a different, earlier, race for my goal race, and adjusted my training plan.<br /><br />After CIF prelims, when I really believed we would be going to states for #1 to run, I decided that since my next choice in half's was not going to work out..... hey, why not try to PR for real at the <a href="http://renegaderaceseries.com/index.php?view=details&amp;id=26%3Asanta-run&amp;option=com_eventlist&amp;Itemid=146" target="_blank">Renegade Santa Run</a>?? <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://renegaderaceseries.com/images/stories/santa_run/2013/2013medal.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://renegaderaceseries.com/images/stories/santa_run/2013/2013medal.png" width="233" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Look at this fun medal!! You can use "HEATHERDISCOUNT" for a discount!</td></tr></tbody></table>So, last week, even though I posted a half training plan week, I decided Monday afternoon that Santa Run 5k was my new goal race. If I could PR there, I had top 3 in my AG (based on last year's results) in my sights. That might be fun!<br /><br />I adjusted my training plan again, and added a lot of interval work - I'd been doing a lot of longer intervals and tempo runs, so I threw in a bunch of 400s and 800s instead.<br /><br /><i>I know, I know, I retired from 5k's immediately following the Veteran's Day not-quite-5k, but I get confused.</i><br /><br />Since suddenly, the 5k was my focus, I did the 400s last week, and nailed it - all at my goal pace<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yvWVjeXN3RE/UpSs7WC3VmI/AAAAAAAAE2M/cxwFsCNQ75s/s1600/dailymile.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="47" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yvWVjeXN3RE/UpSs7WC3VmI/AAAAAAAAE2M/cxwFsCNQ75s/s400/dailymile.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">wheeeeeee so faaaast!</td></tr></tbody></table>.<br />Anyway. Then we found out we weren't going to states, after-all (pride goeth before the fall, sorry, girls, I blame myself), so the half I thought was out, was suddenly back on the table!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://michellemuto.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/tumblr_m7eq09aq0r1rziwwco1_500.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="176" src="http://michellemuto.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/tumblr_m7eq09aq0r1rziwwco1_500.gif" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>I had one last "long" run that I left on my plan <i>juuuuust in case</i>, so I set out Sunday to do it - 8 miles, middle 4 at goal pace. This should have been easy, breezy.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dRBQxj9gfME/USFm7fIpLBI/AAAAAAAAFrE/_H1I6zfYY_w/s1600/CatParty.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dRBQxj9gfME/USFm7fIpLBI/AAAAAAAAFrE/_H1I6zfYY_w/s320/CatParty.gif" width="239" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">how I felt after.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I got through a mile warm up, 3 pace miles, and just stopped. I felt fine, I just didn't feel like doing any more.<br /><br />And now, it's Tuesday, 5 days before my supposed goal race, and... I kind of don't feel like it? I looked back over my training log, and my last long run was 14 miles back on November 14 - so it COULD count, and just pretend I've been on an extended two week taper? I just feel like a loser-pants, to let one lack-luster "long" run decide that I'm not even going to bother.<br /><br />I'd still really like to get a real 5k PR, so I'll keep working on that in the meantime, but to recap... maaaaybe I'm running a half this weekend, but MAYBE NOT. Oh, the suspense.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Since it was close by, I used the run over to the race as my warm-up, and tossed in some strides on the way.<br /><br />The race started a few minutes late, with a pre-race Veterans Day ceremony just before....<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://scontent-b-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1462904_10201379601585312_705260642_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://scontent-b-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1462904_10201379601585312_705260642_n.jpg" width="239" /></a></div>The course starts with a loop through Woodbridge Community Park, then out and back on the bike path (my nemesis from the PCRF training days....), and another loop through the park back to the finish line.<br /><br />So, here's the real details on the race: The course is not marked. There are volunteers telling people where to go, but there was one missing, for example, at the first loop through the park, so we went the wrong direction for about 50 feet - there were left-over arrows on the ground from TNT training over the weekend, so it was confusing. The volunteer at the 5k turn-around, I think, had us turn too early - there's a section on the path (if you're familiar, I'm talking about the bike path between East Yale Loop, and Jeffrey) with two bridges - the volunteer had us turn at the first bridge, but I'm pretty sure it should have been the second bridge. Also, at the finish, I did not see any water, etc. Not a big deal for me, because it was cool this morning and there are water fountains at the park, just a note.<br /><br />BUT, it was really inexpensive (I paid $30 for a last minute registration), and included a pin, medal, and shirt. Plus, a portion of proceeds go to <a href="http://www.foldsofhonor.org/" target="_blank">Folds of Honor Foundation</a>, an organization that provides scholarships and other assistance to spouses and children of soldiers killed or disabled in service.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.veteransdayrun.com/images/foh_500.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="176" src="http://www.veteransdayrun.com/images/foh_500.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://app.etapestry.com/hosted/FoldsofHonorFoundation/OnlineDonation.html" target="_blank">You can donate to Folds of Honor HERE</a></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I'd rather run a low-key race with a good heart like this than fret about details and complain about stuff.<br /><br />Mostly, I wanted to get an idea of where I am with training, and if I have a reasonable goal for winter and spring races. With that in mind, my goal pace was around 8:50-8:40 (my 5k PR pace was 8:56, 27:47).<br /><br />The course measured at 2.74mi for me, and I finished with a 8:31 pace. WHAT. Mile splits: &nbsp;8:34, 8:31, 8:31.<br /><br />If it were an actual 5k distance, and I managed to hold that pace (and I think I could?), it would be a 26:25ish finish.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://scontent-b-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1458640_10201379854151626_1038791895_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://scontent-b-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1458640_10201379854151626_1038791895_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />I was third female at the turn-around (there was a kid that was running the 5k that turned around before I did and cut the course a few times through the park loop, and finished just in front of me, so I'm not counting her, CHEATER). Small races are the greatest.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the event - I wouldn't recommend it if you're going to freak out on the details, but for $30, it served it's purpose for me.<br /><br />Related, I've decided the 5k is not something I'm really interested in repeating. That isht is hard, yo. Give me a marathon, any day.<br /><br />*******************************************************************************<br /><br />Plan for the week!<br /><br />To sum it up quickly, last week SUCKED. I just wasn't feeling the run love, not at all. So I didn't hit all of my miles. Oh wells. Taper for a 5k? HAHAHAHA.<br /><br /><b>Monday</b>: XT<br />arms, core, pushups<br /><br /><b>Tuesday</b>: nothing<br />Zippo.<br /><br /><b>Wednesday</b>: speeeeeeed, XT<br />2 mile repeats!! These sounded so scary, but then they weren't too bad. 1 mile warm up, 2x2mi, with 400RI, cool down. Goal pace was 9:11-8:59, actual was 9:09, 9:01. Felt good. Also did arms, and core.<br /><br /><b>Thursday</b>: XT<br />Just pushups<br /><br /><b>Friday</b>: easy, XT<br />4 miles easy pace with strides; arms/core<br /><br /><b>Saturday</b>: FAILED long run<br />Scheduled for 13 easy. Got through 5, felt crappy and achy and blah, and people wandered into the gym, so I called it a day and surrendered my treadmill.<br /><br /><b>Sunday</b>: rest<br />I did absolutely negative zero things.<br /><br />Total: 15 miles.<br /><br />Oh well.<br /><br />This week:<br /><br /><b>Monday</b>: see above; 5 miles total for the day, with warm up/cool down<br /><b>Tuesday</b>: easy or rest<br /><b>Wednesday</b>: 7 miles strides<br /><b>Thursday</b>: rest<br /><b>Friday</b>: 15 easy<br /><b>Saturday</b>: rest (we'll be at XC for the day)<br /><b>Sunday</b>: 3-4 easy<br /><br />*************************************************************************<br />Cross-country update.....<br />#1's team came in second in league finals Friday (#1 finished in 19:05, for 21st place!), so they're heading to state prelims next weekend!!!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/1457586_772312439450345_501416069_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/1457586_772312439450345_501416069_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">she fliiiiiies</td></tr></tbody></table>The girl's varsity team....<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1394241_772314562783466_565936528_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="228" src="https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1394241_772314562783466_565936528_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">One of these things, is not like the other....</td></tr></tbody></table>I'm really excited to check out the Mt Sac course, and all the fast fasties.

The top 7 schools in each division move on to the state competition in Fresno. Going in, her school was ranked #9 in the state, and 7th in our section. The school we were most concerned about beating was really neck-and-neck with us at prelims, and ranked 10th in the state, and 8th in our section. We were psyched that it was shaping up to be an exciting race, and... I'll admit, a little confident that we would pull it out.<br /><br />Since I have alllllllll the free time on my hands, I did a lot of number crunching last week, building out fake-meets against our schools, and every way I played with the numbers, we were looking solid.<br /><br />Saturday, #1 woke up and was practically giddy. She was excited to run, and looked confident. The girl is a head-case runner - seeing her confident to go into this course was great.<br /><br />Spectating XC is an interesting day. The courses are short, usually 3 miles, and run so fast, that to spectate in a few places, you have to MOVE. Generally, there's a flood of spectators that flee from spot to spot throughout the course to catch their runners as they move through.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5c5bC_0LwxA/UpKqYytaXZI/AAAAAAAAE0Y/EAWEonaDzHY/s1600/1454975_569362313132865_1441870246_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5c5bC_0LwxA/UpKqYytaXZI/AAAAAAAAE0Y/EAWEonaDzHY/s400/1454975_569362313132865_1441870246_n.jpg" width="266" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Exactly like this....</td></tr></tbody></table>If you've ever spectated a longer race before, it's exactly like that, but ON SPEED.<br /><br />The Mt Sac course is pretty loopy for the first 1.5mi, so you can kind of catch the athletes in about 4 locations before they head up the second half. We knew the layout from last week, and had a pretty solid spectating strategy, so we stuck with it (if you're interested, <a href="http://events.mtsac.edu/ccinvite/raceinfo/coursemaps.pdf" target="_blank">this is the course map</a> - we planted ourselves at the end of the airstrip, before the loop, so we saw her at the start, on the first loop go around, then ran over to switchbacks, then to the crossover, and then to the gauntlet for the finish - I swear these are all things on the course that I'm totally not making up).<br /><br />Anyway. We're at our spot. The field takes off - 16 teams, 7 girls each team, plus individuals - and right away, I note that the field is tight, and FAST. It looks like our team is having some trouble sticking together in a pack, but #1 is looking good in her mid-pack position.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.prepcaltrack.com/wp-contentdata/uploads/2013/11/002_DSC_6147-300x200.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://www.prepcaltrack.com/wp-contentdata/uploads/2013/11/002_DSC_6147-300x200.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">source: <a href="http://www.prepcaltrack.com/2013/11/24/cif-ss-finals-photos-by-joe-gagnon/" target="_blank">Joe Gagnon/PrepCalTrack</a></td></tr></tbody></table>As we're waiting for them to come through the first loop, Sarah Baxter breeeeeezes through, well ahead of everyone else.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jVVvZrTwHas/UpKruAOlTyI/AAAAAAAAE0k/3rPodFGqi_o/s1600/004.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jVVvZrTwHas/UpKruAOlTyI/AAAAAAAAE0k/3rPodFGqi_o/s400/004.JPG" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Oh, look. She's winning!</td></tr></tbody></table>The lead pack comes through, and I start to get a little nervous - usually there's three girls on our team that start together, but they were <i>not </i>running together this time. Then the chase pack comes through - usually, #1 is solidly mid-pack, in here. And usually by now, the herd has thinned a bit - not so much this time. They're all still running really tight, and FAST.<br /><br />Then the girl that runs 7th for us ran by, and we thought we must have missed #1 in the herd.<br /><br />15-20 seconds later, after everyone else has passed, is #1.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-M45TG4SVGvg/UpKsd907yjI/AAAAAAAAE0s/oQEevPO3s7I/s1600/007.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-M45TG4SVGvg/UpKsd907yjI/AAAAAAAAE0s/oQEevPO3s7I/s320/007.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>My first thought, is she got frustrated with the pack, and was giving herself space? She always starts slow and then kicks in... maybe the fast start was too much. Maybe she wanted to give herself some room.<br /><br />And then I hear her breathing, and it's clearly distressed. I didn't connect what happened at first, until she was running past, and The H noticed the giant scrape under her right hip.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-O1sYIH8rDi0/UpLYsUcinwI/AAAAAAAAE08/slHvvj7LQkU/s1600/008.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-O1sYIH8rDi0/UpLYsUcinwI/AAAAAAAAE08/slHvvj7LQkU/s400/008.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />Somewhere in the first 800, she had fallen. And my heart just sunk for her.<br /><br />We went over to the switchbacks, where she'd come through after the second loop around the field, and she was at the back, but was caught up to the rest of the pack (so, in the second 800, she made up 20 seconds on the rest of the field), and came through the first mile in 6:12.<br /><br />When she came by us, before heading up the switchbacks, she was crying, and limping.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1nUYAxlxgnQ/UpLayBK1iBI/AAAAAAAAE1I/UjaQPRGWl3s/s1600/1455106_572285179507245_1260815165_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1nUYAxlxgnQ/UpLayBK1iBI/AAAAAAAAE1I/UjaQPRGWl3s/s400/1455106_572285179507245_1260815165_n.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">on Switchbacks</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Waiting for her at crossover was just THE WORST EVER. As her mom, I'm a pretty tough-love kind of parent, and generally defer to the coaching she receives from the XC team, but it was horrible, knowing how HARD running is, how hard running uphill is, and that she was doing it while crying and limping.<br /><br />She came through crossover, and had passed a few runners. After crossover, we planned to wait for her at the gauntlet (the last 200m at the finish), because the rest of the course is hard to get to and then still get to the finish.

I was expecting to feel a bit sore and achy, but man alive, the first few days were rough. I did zero running until 6 days out, and finally felt pretty good then. I got SUPER motivated to hit 100 miles in December, and calculated that I would need, like, 36 miles in the next 9 days to do it.<br /><br />Last week, I ran a few more times, and did a couple days of cross training. I did not come ANYWHERE close to 36 miles, and... that's a-okay by me.

The course is a nice mix of mostly pavement, with some dirt trail the first half. I love dirt, so that's great for me.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Registration prices start at just $25 for the 5k, $35 for the 10k, and $15 for the kids run - this includes a great medal and long sleeve cotton tee.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/527038_10201613095422512_598741083_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/527038_10201613095422512_598741083_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">so cute and sparkly!</td></tr></tbody></table><div>They have awards 3 deep in each age group, plus a costume contest - the costume was a big source of stress for me.

I was hopeful that the nice weather would come back, but alas, it was warm and SUNNY. Since these are my 3 least favorite things - hills, sun, and heat - I was not super optimistic when we got there. On top of that, my legs felt.... kind of flat. I felt okay, but I sure wasn't feeling very peppy. I had cut back on my longer speed work over the last 4 weeks, to focus on shorter 5k efforts, so I wasn't sure my previous 2:05 goal was still reasonable.<br /><br />After a last-second bathroom excursion (real bathrooms!), Monica and I squeezed into the corrals as the national anthem was finishing up. I stuck to my spot between the 2:00-2:10 pacers....<br /><br /><b>Goal A</b>: 2:05, 9:32 pace. This was kind of an arbitrary goal that I picked back in September.<br /><b>Goal B</b>: PR, sub-2:11, 9:59 or under<br /><b>Goal C</b>: Eh. If I felt just DEAD DEAD DEAD, I planned to circle back to a friend of mine that was running a slower pace, and run/walk with her and take pictures, pretending I was at Disney.<br /><br />When the race started, I tried sticking with the 2 hour pacer (WHY WOULD I DO THAT??) for a bit, but I thought she was just going too fast for me to sustain, so I dropped back before the end of the first mile.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">I realized pretty much right away that my legs just felt heavy. However, I also realized that they felt just as crappy running uphill as they did running downhill, so... pretty much, I just ran. I know that's a simplistic and ridiculous thing to even say, but since I was uncomfortable either way, I just went with it.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n0edwy_Rejs/Uq9igFX1O2I/AAAAAAAAE4A/NW6G4IUm7Dc/s1600/hh.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n0edwy_Rejs/Uq9igFX1O2I/AAAAAAAAE4A/NW6G4IUm7Dc/s320/hh.JPG" width="215" /></a><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kPF-jYkYBHo/Uq9ihPC-ROI/AAAAAAAAE4U/Ovt7My90nsI/s1600/hh4.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kPF-jYkYBHo/Uq9ihPC-ROI/AAAAAAAAE4U/Ovt7My90nsI/s320/hh4.JPG" width="195" /></a></div><br />I tried to run a consistent effort, and while I was checking in with my Garmin fairly regularly, I was trying to not let what I saw change how I was running. If it felt okay, I kept going. If I felt like it was a lot of effort, I eased up and let it happen.<br /><br />Pretty much the ENTIRE time, I was thinking:<br />This is really hard.<br />Keep moving your feet.<br />This is REALLY HARD.<br />Holy crap, this is so hard.<br /><br />I know I keep saying this, but for real, even the downhills I felt like it was all just so hard, because my legs were D E A D.<br /><br />The course loops around the fairplex, out into a park, back through some the fairplex, then loops through Bonelli park and around a lake from miles 3-11. You guys, I remember NONE of the lake, at all, and that's crazy, because... I ran around a lake for 7 miles. I don't even know what was happening around me.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ARB92lgdo5E/Uq9ii-V48II/AAAAAAAAE4k/t_y1xcaUHSA/s1600/hh2.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ARB92lgdo5E/Uq9ii-V48II/AAAAAAAAE4k/t_y1xcaUHSA/s320/hh2.JPG" width="206" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">and yet, there it is. a lake.&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>Anyway. I feel like the miles ticked by pretty quickly, and when I got to mile 8, I started doing some brain math to figure out how much cushion I had to still hit a PR. I knew 2:05 was out, but that was fine - I really didn't think that was in the cards in the heat/with the hills. I was feeling pretty tired, but it was no different than before, so.... I kept going. I was certainly slowing down, and my legs were even MORE dead, which I was surprised about, because I didn't know it was even possible.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FiEhj-EuBWI/Uq9igr8uNWI/AAAAAAAAE4M/6Ks3y6SSxhE/s1600/hh3.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FiEhj-EuBWI/Uq9igr8uNWI/AAAAAAAAE4M/6Ks3y6SSxhE/s320/hh3.JPG" width="212" /></a></div><br />I knew at some point, there was a downhill to the finish, but I couldn't remember if it started at mile 11 or 12, so I was pretty sad when mile 11 felt HARD. Joke's on me, downhill started at mile 12.<br /><br />Margot - my running fairy godmother - jumped in with me around 12.5, and tried to run fast, but I had negative-zero kick left, and shuffled along behind her.<br /><br />Man. It was one hard-earned medal for me.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w45/lorasmom/blog/D3FC9467-83BA-4EED-BAE7-8E1FD5AD72D7_zpsk9v1ov7z.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w45/lorasmom/blog/D3FC9467-83BA-4EED-BAE7-8E1FD5AD72D7_zpsk9v1ov7z.jpg" width="238" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #37404e; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.98611068725586px;">Splits: 9:18, 9:51, 10:06, 9:25, 9:36, 9:33, 9:50, 10:12, 9:31, 10:08, 10:13, 10:03, 9:27. .2 8:49.&nbsp;</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>&nbsp;2:08:56 - Garmin measured 13.2mi, and 9:46 pace.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>&nbsp;After the race, I met back up with Monica, <a href="http://skinnyrunner.com/" target="_blank">SR</a>, and SR's friend Reese while Margot ran a few more miles, because she's an overachiever.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://scontent-b-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1390478_10201621099302604_1218012702_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://scontent-b-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1390478_10201621099302604_1218012702_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />And then we did the blogger-required things, like stopping at Starbucks and taking pictures of our food.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w45/lorasmom/blog/B0778620-168C-4166-9B41-A25F3E663D4F_zpselupo2mv.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="238" src="http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w45/lorasmom/blog/B0778620-168C-4166-9B41-A25F3E663D4F_zpselupo2mv.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Epilogue:<br /><br />I am really, really, really pleased with this race. I am still kind of surprised that it even happened. I didn't expect a PR, honestly, and I spent so much time thinking that I was REALLY uncomfortable, and being surprised I wasn't stopping. I was one walk break away from missing a PR, but I never really considered walking? Like, it didn't really cross my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;the 2:10 pacer passed me at one point going up a hill in mile 10, and I just let her go, then caught and passed her on the downhill. I don't know. Maybe this is some "mental fortitude" I have been missing in previous races?<br /><br />I've been having some issues on my recent long runs with - I'm guessing - my salt/dehydration/something like that. I am a reallllly salty sweat-er, and on my last 3 or 4 runs over 13ish miles, I've ended up with raging headaches for the rest of the day. I am a living-on-the-edge type of girl, so I tried a different fueling plan Sunday - margarita shot blocks every mile, starting at mile 3, and a salted caramel GU around mile 10-11. It was... okay. I don't know, I still felt on the verge of leg-cramping a few times, but I'm not sure if it was the salt/electrolytes, tired legs, or just hills. Anyway, the headache didn't happen, so I guess it's some improvement.<br /><br />There were supposed to be aid stations every mile after mile 5, but that wasn't really the case, and it was kind of frustrating for me to NOT have aid stations where I expected them to be, because I was timing my fuel. I mean, I am an obsessive type, and checked the website so I could be prepared, so it's annoying to not have the stations where they're advertised. Whatever.<br /><br />It's really a lame complaint, because there were PLENTY of stations, I just wanted them in specific spots I guess? lol.<br /><br />The shirts are really great - I LOVE it.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w45/lorasmom/blog/BF67B01A-686C-4FCE-B12B-DFD6D2EF32C2_zpsimakyzjp.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://i173.photobucket.com/albums/w45/lorasmom/blog/BF67B01A-686C-4FCE-B12B-DFD6D2EF32C2_zpsimakyzjp.jpg" width="238" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I am lame and didn't take a better picture - this print is on the left side/bottom of the shirt.&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br />It was hot hot hot hot hot. I think mid-70's at finish? With an 8am start, it was pretty rough on me - I wilt in the heat. If the race had started an hour earlier, it would have been much better. A lot of the course is exposed, so with the bright burning sun, it was pretty horrendous. I really don't like hot/sun.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good race, and well organized. However, IMO, it's over-priced <i>unless you register for early-bird pricing</i>. A few years ago, I want to say I registered for this event for, like, $60 (and ended up DNS'ing). This year, when I thought about registering last month, I think it was $90? Thank goodness for a last-minute giveaway.<br /><br />The course is HARD. I know I went in with tired legs, but it is constant rolling hills. There are no flats.<br /><br />Monday, my legs felt pretty beat up - my quads, hamstrings, and glutes were UNIMPRESSED with all the things I did to them this weekend. But.... I'm curious what I could do on a friendlier course, so.... maybe a do-over is in order? Maybe.<br /><br />Or I could just retire now.

Resting exhausts me. (Really, having the kids out of school made it exceptionally easy to laze around watching dumb tv with them).<br /><br /><b>Wednesday</b>: Speed - 5 miles<br />800s. They were fast and hard, but I (mostly) hit my paces. Goal was 7:50-7:24, actual was 7:53, 7:49, 7:47, 7:41.<br /><br /><b>Thursday</b>: <strike>Rest.</strike> 4 mile walk<br />I felt SO GOOD after the 800's, I told The H I really really FOR REAL wanted to run the Saturday half. He mocked me. I forgot, does walking count as exercise?! We did some evening shopping at Target, and I had the genius idea to walk there - a 4 mile round-trip excursion. It was brilliant, until The H purchased a very large, fairly heavy item. Dummy.<br /><br /><b>Friday</b>: Rest again!<br /><br /><b>Saturday</b>: Pretend run. Got through 2 miles. I woke up truly excited to run. And then it was terrible. I quit. We bought donuts and sat around instead.Spent the day so grateful for The H's mocking, and happy I wasn't running a half on Sunday, because I don't even know if I can run that many miles any more I AM THE LAMEST WHY DO I EEEEVVVVEEEEEN TRRRRRYYYYYYYYY. It was dramatic.<br /><br /><b>Sunday</b>: Long run<br />12.1 really, REALLY great miles. I could have run faster, but wanted to keep it easy. I could have run longer, but there was a creeper in the gym. It was pretty much the greatest ever - how could it not be, with all of my favorite things.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1450220_10201531288337386_1303450875_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1450220_10201531288337386_1303450875_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />So, I didn't run the half. I've always kind of thought that I was NOT a mental runner - I thought I was pretty objective about things, don't let singular bad runs throw shade at my overall training experiences, etc. I think, maybe, I was lying to myself, lol.<br /><br />Without any real money on the line, it's really easy to just blow off training for something. Since I'm currently enjoying some <i>funemployment </i>time, my race budget is limited, and I want to keep it to real race efforts, or races I really, REALLY want to do. For whatever (probably made up) reason, I didn't feel like I was ready to PR this weekend, so I just.... didn't want to spend the money on the registration.<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, it's kind of a cop out. I know anything can happen on race day, but I'd rather feel good about my chances, I guess. I'm a safe gambler.<br /><br />ANYWAY.<br /><br />Blah blah blah, I was a headcase and didn't run a race.<br /><br />The Renegade Santa Race is in 2 weeks, so for the next two weeks, I'm maintaining focus on that as my "goal" race, because I really want that legit 5k PR - that means continuing the speed work. I'll still do a long run this week, though, because my eyes are on a plan B half at the end of the month.<br /><br />Maybe. HAHAHAHA.<br /><br />This week.....<br /><br /><b>Monday</b>: easy/XT<br /><b>Tuesday</b>: 5 easy<br /><b>Wednesday</b>: XT<br /><b>Thursday</b>: speed - 10x400 (did you know 400s are my FAVORITE?!)<br /><b>Friday</b>: easy/XT<br /><b>Saturday</b>: easy/rest<br /><b>Sunday</b>: Long (14ish)<br /><br /><br />

First, it involves this....<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1380175_10201601753978983_1743697027_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1380175_10201601753978983_1743697027_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />2. Which I'll wear Saturday for.....<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://renegaderaceseries.com/images/eventlist/events/small/events_2012santarun_logo_1345664877.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://renegaderaceseries.com/images/eventlist/events/small/events_2012santarun_logo_1345664877.png" width="200" /></a></div>Where I hope to PR the 5k FOR REAL THIS TIME. I had a goal kind of picked out, and ran it by the <a href="http://fasterbunny.com/" target="_blank">smartest bunny I know</a>, and since she thinks it's reasonable, I'm going to give it a shot. I have been doing a decent amount of speed work, and it's all been going pretty well.<br /><br />(My current *real* PR is 27:47 from July 2012; the <a href="http://365awesomedays.blogspot.com/2013/11/veterans-day-run-5k-pftw.html" target="_blank">Vet's Day race would have been a PR</a>, but since it was not anywhere close to a real distance, I'm not counting it).<br /><br />My super lofty, man-I-hope-I-don't-puke goal: 25:45 (8:18 pace)<br />Goal B is to just PR: 8:55ish pace<br />I have no goal C. If I fail, I quit.<br /><br />JK, my C goal, as it always is in a 5k, is don't puke or die.<br /><br />#1 will be running, as well, and I tried to tell her it would be HILARIOUS to toe the line like it's a cross country race....<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1393150_10201366495217661_1102259898_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1393150_10201366495217661_1102259898_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>So far, she has declined.<br /><br /><br />3. Anyway, after Saturday's fun, I plan to try my hand at....<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lQIw8WvKefw/Uqn-KwQo9PI/AAAAAAAAE2s/EEaxCp3umpI/s1600/holiday+half.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lQIw8WvKefw/Uqn-KwQo9PI/AAAAAAAAE2s/EEaxCp3umpI/s1600/holiday+half.JPG" /></a></div>Yeah, yeah, I wasn't going to race this, but theeeeen I snagged a free bib from <a href="http://runeatrepeat.com/" target="_blank">Run, Eat, Repeat</a>, and now I'm going to! Yay, free.<br /><br />So after I got that bib, I thought..... man, it would be kiiiind of fun to PR TWICE IN ONE WEEKEND.<br /><br />Wouldn't that be FUN???<br /><br /><b>So, my goals for Sunday are.....</b><br />A: 2:05, 9:32 pace. I honestly don't know that I'm in the right place for a 2:05 right now, because I've been doing shorter, faster runs in prep for the 5k. BUT WHO KNOWS!<br /><br />B: PR. My current PR is 2:11 (9:59 pace) from PCRF back in May 2012. That seems like BILLIONS OF EONS AGO. This wouldn't take too much effort, I don't think, but I have no idea how I'd feel on a hilly course the day after maybe running a 5k hard. So we'll see.<br /><br />C: If I get out there and a PR is just not in the cards, I'll run it easy and enjoy a long run with a friend. There are no losers here, so I'm sure it's going to be a swell day.<br /><br /><br />Really, it's just been soooooo long since I've raced anything, I'm excited to be back out there and am really looking forward to all of it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I'm not really big on the sentimentality behind the year flipping over, and changing the calendar on the wall doesn't mark a fresh beginning - every single day, every hour you have that opportunity; I don't understand why so many people wait until a calendar dictates it's time to move.<br /><br />Dates seem sort of irrelevant to me. I don't like confining definitions to match a box in the calendar. I don't want to celebrate someone's life because we penciled their birthday into one of those boxes - I want to be excited they're here, every day. I don't love my husband more because that box says it's valentine's day, or our anniversary.<br /><br />When I think back about my life, experiences, the kids, my family, events I remember... most memories are pictures, they're experiences, and senses. I don't often attach a date to my memories. Just the feelings.<br /><br />January 1st is an exception.<br /><br />In 1999, I was young, and a little crazy and dumb, and sure thought I knew a lot of things. I was overdue with my kid #1, and was OVER being pregnant. We had picked out a middle name based on her Christmas-y due date - Noelle - and I was annoyed that it would no longer make sense, because we are now so far outside that holiday window.<br /><br />On January 1st, my husband and I went out for dinner. We didn't do it often, we were young and poor, but we did it that day. I'm sure I was throwing a tantrum of some type, and he put up with it and met my demands. We went to TGI Fridays by the local mall. I'd been craving buffalo chicken for the entire pregnancy, but had been avoiding it, because I was taking the spicy foods superstition to heart.<br /><br />On January 1st, I ordered buffalo chicken, because - what's the worst that would happen? I have a baby?<br /><br />Just like in the movies, I started having contractions, there in the restaurant. Unlike in the movies, it was non-dramatic, and I didn't even realize it until several had passed. We went home, started logging the contractions on a piece of lined notebook paper, and I spent the last hours of the first day of 1999 in the hospital, begging for an epidural, and finally getting one, but only because there were some complications. I remember thinking that none of this was going the way I anticipated, and not worried - just accepting - that there's nothing I can do about that. No amount of crazy-person pregnancy tantrums will change it.<br /><br /><br />January 1st, 2011. I worked in e-commerce and holidays are always extra busy. I always look forward to January 1st, for the day off.<br /><br />Gabby had been fighting some sort of cold. She had been coughing, and couldn't kick it - the doctor wasn't too concerned the week before, even after small red dots popped up around her eyes (from small blood vessels broken during the coughs). I figured after a lazy winter break from school, she just needed to be pepped up, run around outside and get some fresh air.<br /><br />I spent January 1st, 2011, dragging her to any place I could think of - a park, where I made her climb up a small hill to get to the swings (she barely made it, and sat lethargically in the seat while I pushed her, before she asked to leave), the furniture store to look at new couches (where she practically fell asleep in the little car she was "pushing"), to Costco, where we didn't really need anything (where she actually DID fall asleep in the cart).<br /><br />Looking back now, I can see clearly that her lethargy had been progressively getting worse, that she was practically a shell of her normal, vibrant 4 year old self. At the time, in that day, it was an annoyance. I didn't have time for a sick kid, because we had a birthday to celebrate the next day.<br /><br />Sometime in the late afternoon, after all of my attempts to perk up the kid had failed, I took her to urgent care. An hour later, the ER doctor told us she was being transported to the oncology ICU, and that it was serious.<br /><br />I remember everything that happened, vividly, that night, and I remember being all at once annoyed that she was sick, dreading that it was something for real serious - maybe that's why I tried to avoid the doctor entirely? - and every time I thought back on the last few weeks with her, and had to recount her slowly progressing symptoms, ashamed that I had not stepped in faster, and concerned that someone, anyone who heard that it had been a few weeks of the cough, that she was lethargic for days, that she hadn't eaten and had no interest in food all day, that they were judging me as a terrible, neglectful parent. When I said all of those things together, out loud, it seemed ridiculous that I had just tried to heal her with a trip to look at couches.<br /><br />I could recount everything that transpired - I sent my husband home from the ER after they drew her blood, because I (still) didn't think it would be too much of a crisis, and we were right down the street from home - he had just gotten off of work, so I told him to go home and eat. My second call - to my cousin, after the ER doctors looked concerned about her blood work. We spent the last hours of the first day of 2011 in the hospital, with a vague "cancery" diagnosis. It was certainly not how I anticipated the day ending, but... what can you do.<br /><br /><br />On January 2, 2011, we celebrated #1 turning 12 in the OICU, with a cake, that we shared with the residents and nurses, while Gab had her first lumbar puncture and bone marrow biopsy.<br /><br />It's tricky to reconcile those memories.<br /><br /><br /><br />
