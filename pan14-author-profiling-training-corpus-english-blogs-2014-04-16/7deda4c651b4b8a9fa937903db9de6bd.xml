I undertook my assigned mission of reading this book with boyish glee, as it appears to be rigt up my alley: Pirates, unidentified monsters, deeds of daring, etc.<br /><br />Burridge paints beautiful imagery of the Seychelle Islands, which are north and slightly west of Madagascar, in the Indian Ocean.  His love of the area is present, even throughout some of the more gruesome events depicted in "Kolony."<br /><br />The novel begins with a prologue, set in 1882 England, in which a young, aristocratic woman is wooed and then deceived, brutally raped and murdered by one Eric Liddle, who we learn is a pirate.  Liddle's escape via ship ends the prologue.  The first chapter takes place far away, on one of the Seychelle Islands, and depicts the human sacrifice of young boy by a mysterious man whose most distinguishing feature is an extremely long thumbnail, which has been filed on one side to almost razor sharpness.  So we're clearly dealing with some bad folks, here.<br /><br />Burridge introduces us to his protagonist, Timothy Scully, at the beginning of the third chapter.  Scully is returning to the Seychelles from the Far East, where he had been working as a diver (SCUBA, not Olympic).  His return is prompted by the news that his fiancee has disappeared.  <br /><br />Mystery, intrigue, and mayhem ensue.<br /><br />I'm not going to get into much more, if any, detail about the plot itself.  My overall experience with the book was disappointing, unfortunately, for more than one reason.<br /><br />First of all, after the prologue, there is really no clear indication that the story has jumped forward to the 21st Century until well into the 2nd chapter.  Nothing in the description of the characters in the human sacrifice episode gave me any clue that the story was no longer set in the late 1800s.  In fact, we don't actually learn that little detail until about halfway through the entire book, which is over 600 pages long (paperback).  That was more than a little annoying to me, because until thumbnail man reappeared, I had no idea why the first chapter was even in the book.  Plotwise, it wasn't necessary as written.<br /><br />I also had difficulty keeping track of who was speaking throughout much of the story.  Part of this may be related to publishing and printing choices, which I'll address shortly.  But the main problem was Burridge's frequent habit of writing dialogue without beginning a new paragraph whenever changing speakers.  If a writer is going to stray from that convention, he should at least throw in a "he said," or "she said," just to help the reader stay with him.  There were several times when I had to back up almost an entire page just to retrace whose turn it was to speak.  <br /><br />This next issue could either be attributed to Burridge, or perhaps to his publisher.  I mentioned the dialog not being sufficiently broken up into paragraphs.  But the paragraphs themselves were often difficult to identify.  Usually, a book will indent the beginning of a paragraph, or skip a line, as I'm doing in this post.  Sometimes both, but that's really overkill.  Kolony does neither.  The only indication that a new paragraph has begun is that the <em>previous line of text</em> does not reach all the way to the right hand margin.  As with the dialogue issues, this sometimes made it very difficult to follow the story.  More difficult than I would have thought,  actually.<br /><br />There is quite a bit of action in Kolony, but something about Burridge's style made it very hard for me to follow it.  Many times I read a passage thinking that the characters were standing within arm's length, only to find out later (through inferrence only) that they were in fact barely within earshot of each other.  It certainly changes the dynamic of a situation to find out that, not only could two rivals not touch each other; they wouldn't have been able to have a successful rock fight.<br /><br />A few more points, and I'll be on my way...<br /><br />There was a little too much <em>Deus ex machina</em> for my taste.<br /><br />My favorite character was a dog.<br /><br />So many characters were revealed to be in league with "the bad guys" that it stopped being a revelation after a while, and more of a "okay, I was wondering when we were going to find out."<br /><br />The dog was really big.<br /><br />The good guys win, sort of.<br /><br />That was one awesome dog.<br /><br />Burridge's account of how the bad guys got to be the way they are did not make me suspend disbelief.  In other words, throughout the entire novel, I was fully aware that I was "reading a book," and not experiencing a story.  Big difference.<br /><br />One of the most badass dogs ever.<br /><br />The epilogue was in the form of a letter from one character to the protagonist.  By the time I got to it, I didn't really even care that it was set in a script font that was almost too small to read.<br /><br />I really wanted to be able to recommend "Kolony."  But I'm afraid that dog will eat me if I do.<br /><br /><div align="center"> </div><div align="center">COMING ATTRACTIONS</div><div align="center"> </div><div align="left">Next time I'll have a much more positive review, of Mira Grant's "Newsflesh" Trilogy.</div><div align="left"> </div><div align="left">Until then, keep reading!</div><div align="left"> </div><div align="left">Alan Andrews</div><div align="left">Basso for Hire?</div><div align="center">?</div><br /><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BassoForHire/~4/2sWzumKXyTU" height="1" width="1"/>

US publication was in 2007.  I don't know why I just recently found this series, but I'm glad I did.  It's given me a well needed dose of Epic Fantasy while wondering if "A Song of Ice and Fire" will ever be finished.<br /><br />For a first novel, let alone a trilogy, Abercrombie really delivered.  His characters are diverse and complex.  From Jezel dan Luther, a haughty young noble who gradually learns more of the value of others, and himself, to Bayaz, the self-proclaimed "first of the Magi;" who is either a complete charlatan, or a centuries-old wizard.  <br /><br />Then there is Logen Ninefingers, a Northman, also known as "the bloody nine."  Here is truly a berserker with a conscience.  A warrior who has lost everything, but has more to offer than he seems.<br /><br />One of his most intriguing characters, however, is Sand dan Glotka, a Superior for the Inquisition.  In other words, he is one of the chief torturers in the kingdom.  Glotka is an expert torturer partly because he has spent time on both sides of the torture chamber.  His wrecked body reminds him constantly of the man he was, and the man he has become.<br /><br />Abercrombie's narrative flows whether he is portraying the political maneuverings of the Closed Council, a game of cards, a lovers' quarrel, or the mayhem of battle.  This is epic fantasy/swords and sorcerers fare.<br /><br />The First Law trilogy consists of "The Blade Itself," "Before They are Hanged," and "The Last Argument of Kings."  In my next entry, I will discuss both the second and third books.<br /><br />Highly recommended for any "Game of Thrones" or "The Lord of the Rings" fans.<br /><br />Alan Andrews<br />Basso for Hire<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BassoForHire/~4/5EXUWOoYHGU" height="1" width="1"/>

The books are displayed enticingly. There’s a little coffee shop so you can relax with an espresso. They get your favorite writers to come in for readings, so there’s always a sense of event and excitement.<br />They do everything right, and they’ve always had plenty of customers. <br />But they still closed their doors last year.<br /><span id="more-19657"></span>No, not for the reasons you might think. It wasn’t Amazon that killed them, or the proliferation of free content on the web, or the crappy economy.<br />They closed the store because they were leasing their big, comfortable building … and when that lease ran out, their landlord tripled the rent.<br />Literally overnight, their business model quit working. Revenues simply wouldn’t exceed costs. A decision made by another party, one they had no control over, took a wonderful business and destroyed it.<br />And that’s precisely what you risk every day you make your business completely dependent on another company.<br />It might be Facebook. It might be eBay. It might be Google.<br />It’s called digital sharecropping, and it means you’re building your business on someone else’s land.<br />And it’s a recipe for heartbreak and failure.<br /><h3>What’s digital sharecropping, anyway?</h3>Digital sharecropping is a term <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/12/sharecropping_t.php">coined by Nicholas Carr</a> to describe a peculiar phenomenon of Web 2.0.<br /><blockquote>One of the fundamental economic characteristics of Web 2.0 is the distribution of production into the hands of the many and the concentration of the economic rewards into the hands of the few.</blockquote>In other words, anyone can create content on sites like Facebook, but that content effectively belongs to Facebook. The more content we create for free, the more valuable Facebook becomes. We do the work, they reap the profit.<br />The term sharecropping refers to the farming practices common after the U.S. Civil War, but it’s essentially the same thing as feudalism. A big landholder allows individual farmers to work their land, and takes most of the profits generated from the crops. <br />The landlord has all the control. If he decides to get rid of you, you lose your livelihood. If he decides to raise his fees, you go a little hungrier. You do all the work and the landlord gets most of the profit, leaving you a pittance to eke out a living on.<br />Well, we’re not subsistence farmers any more, and our work doesn’t involve 12-hour days in grueling conditions. So is sharecropping still dangerous?<br />It is, for a couple of reasons …<br /><h3>Landlords are fickle</h3>More and more small businesses are moving all of their marketing to sites like Facebook. It’s local, it’s free (or at least cheap), and it makes businesses feel like they’re doing something cutting-edge.<br />But what happens when Facebook thinks you’ve done something that violates their terms of service and deletes your account? Or changes the way you’re allowed to talk with your customers?<br />Facebook is a particularly fast-changing platform, but it’s not the only one. An entire industry has sprung up based on trying to figure out what Google’s going to do tomorrow, both as a search engine and as an advertising platform. <br />If you’re relying on Facebook or Google to bring in all of your new customers, you’re sharecropping. You’re hoping the landlord will continue to like you and support your business, but the fact is, the landlord has no idea who you are and doesn’t actually care.<br /><h3>Landlords go away</h3>The other problem with sharecropping is that the landlord may or may not be here next year.<br />Sharecroppers have put millions of hours into sites like Digg or MySpace. And those sites still exist — but they’re no longer bringing the traffic they once did. <br />Sharecropped land, in other words, has a tendency to become less and less fertile over time.<br />Maybe <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/ultimate-facebook/">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/linkedin/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/google-plus-content-marketing/">Google+</a> will buck the trend. Maybe they’ll continue to stay healthy and vibrant for decades, rather than a year or two.<br />The best we can do is guess. And if we guess wrong, our business goes into a slow and steady decline.<br /><h3>So are Facebook and Google bad for business?</h3>Of course not. Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, and many more sites are all superb tools to add to our marketing <em>mix</em>.<br />The secret is to spend most of your time and creative energy building assets that you control.<br />There are three assets you should be building today, and should continue to focus on for the lifetime of your business:<br /><ol><li>A <a href="http://www.studiopress.com/">well-designed website</a> with your own <a href="http://websynthesis.com/">hosting</a> account</li><li>An opt-in email list, ideally with a high-quality <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/email-autoresponders/">autoresponder</a></li><li>A reputation for providing impeccable value</li></ol>These things are the equivalent of buying your building instead of renting it. <br />Now any of these can fall prey to outside influences. The bookstore’s building can burn down. And your site can be hacked, your email account closed down, your reputation smeared.<br />But repairing your assets is in your control. You can fix the hacked code, export your email list to another provider, and respond effectively to manage your reputation. <br />More important, you can proactively protect those assets by taking website security seriously, avoiding any spammy or dodgy practices with your email, and cultivating a loyal audience who will vouch for you as being one of the good guys.<br />You’ve put a lot of time and effort into your business — don’t put it all at risk by building on rented land.<br />How about you — do you feel confident that you’re developing your own online assets? How’s the balance between assets you control and third-party sites like Facebook or Twitter? <br />Let us know about it in the comments.<br /><div class="alert"><em><strong>About the Author:</strong> <strong>Sonia Simone</strong> is co-founder and CMO of Copyblogger Media.

Brady.&nbsp; It's an apocalypse told on a local scale.&nbsp; When the protagonist first hears about them in Manhattan, they're considered more of a nuisance than an actual threat.&nbsp; But soon after that, they continue to spread outward from the city.&nbsp; Finally, there's nowhere to go.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Row0NqRlJE8/UnzvFs6z28I/AAAAAAAAEpk/e1NVRDcFAo0/s1600/Tarbabies.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Row0NqRlJE8/UnzvFs6z28I/AAAAAAAAEpk/e1NVRDcFAo0/s200/Tarbabies.jpg" width="126" /></a></div><br />What are tarbabies?&nbsp; Well, we're not entirely sure.&nbsp; It's not like they're fast, vicious monsters like werewolves or vampires, and they're not really zombies, either.&nbsp; Just don't let them touch you.&nbsp; In fact, they've been called different things by different people.&nbsp; But "tarbabies," named after Brer Fox's scheme to catch Brer Rabbit in the Uncle Reemus tale, seems to be the name that "sticks."&nbsp; <br /><br />Here's an excerpt...<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span id="freeText1150794503493404250"><em>"That thing on the porch won't go away. I called the police, but I don't think they're coming. They've got their hands full with the Manhattan quarantine, so they can't waste their time on a nothing little town like Otterkill. That means it's up to me and the neighbors, and there are fewer of us every day. Fewer of us, and more of them. Every person we lose is one more monster to deal with. The Spiller family, the folks from the Retirement Center, even the Mathises' Rottweiler are now stalking the streets, waiting for someone to get too close. A single touch is all it takes. I don't know which of my neighbors became the thing on the porch, and I suppose it doesn't matter. I've got to get out of here, but the Tarbabies are already showing up in Albany, and Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. There's nowhere left to run, and there's no point in hiding. Not when the shadows themselves are after you."</em></span></div><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;">The menace of the tarbabies builds throughout the book, as&nbsp;the creatures start appearing everywhere.&nbsp; There is a particularly harrowing scene on the Appalachian Trail, when the main character and his wife are pursued by a "thing that was a duck."&nbsp; If that sounds funny, it's because it is.&nbsp; But Brady still makes it frightening.</div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;">Allen Brady is a local writer here in the Hudson Valley, and I've performed in a couple of shows that he's written or co-written.&nbsp; Tarbabies is published by Spore Press.&nbsp; I look forward to more novels from Allen in the future.&nbsp; </div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;">Hopefully in December, I'll be able to give you a little blog about my NaNoWriMo efforts this month.&nbsp; Until then, keep reading!!!</div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;">Alan Andrews</div><div style="text-align: left;">Bassoforhire</div><br /><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BassoForHire/~4/bh4DYtSt3zM" height="1" width="1"/>

</span>Whirling quickly, he drew back his spear arm and launched his missile at the beast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>His aim was true (this is Tarzan we’re talking about after all, remember?) and his spear found its mark.<o:p></o:p></span><br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Unfortunately, the role of the lion happened to be played by my grandfather, who had come outside to sit in his lawn chair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;

I've got to say, I really liked it.  It was better than I thought it would be, considering all the negative comments I've seen and read leading up to the release.<br /><br />I read the book a couple of years ago and highly recommend it to any zombiphiles. One thing that many people have complained about is that the movie isn't true to the book.&nbsp; I'll agree with that.  It's very different, told from a different perspective.&nbsp; Max Brooks's book is written as "an oral history of the zombie war."&nbsp; It is told in a series of interviews <em>after</em> the "zombie war" is over, and civilization has adapted to life among the undead.&nbsp; The "interviews" provide insight into where the virus originated, how it spread, and&nbsp;our early disastrous attempts at defending ourselves.&nbsp; The movie follows the efforts on Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), a former UN Undersecretary called back to service.&nbsp; Lane's mission is to accompany an expert in infectious diseases to South Korea, in an effort to discover both a cause and solution to the crisis.&nbsp; Mayhem ensues.&nbsp; Lots more stuff happens.&nbsp; Lane has to improvise.<br /><br />One of the most intense scenes in the book&nbsp;is the "battle of Yonkers," which is where it became apparent that destroying the brain was really the only way to stop "Zeke."&nbsp; The battle of Yonkers doesn't appear in the movie.&nbsp; <br /><br />But there are plenty of intense moments:&nbsp; the rush hour traffic jam in Philadelphia, Lane and his family's escape, the refueling stop in Korea, swarms in Jerusalem, mid-air massacres, and the World Health Organization labs, had me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />It's different enough that if you haven't read the book yet, but were planning to, I'd say go ahead and see the movie.  It's not going to ruin the book for you.  Nor will the book ruin the movie, as long as you don't go in expecting the everything to see the same.<br /><br />World War Z is rated PG-13.&nbsp; If you're thinking about taking your kids, or letting them see it, use your own discretion.&nbsp;It's very intense, as I said.&nbsp; But there's not nearly the gore (or language) that you're going to encounter in any given episode of "The Walking Dead."&nbsp; Also, there are no naked naughty bits.<br /><br />After seeing the movie, I'm going to have to read the book again.&nbsp; Just for grins.<br /><br />Alan<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BassoForHire/~4/UrEFtcnunQ0" height="1" width="1"/>

The chief of police promptly had all 20 or so of them arrested and put into holding cells (all the men in one and all the women in another)  When they told him he couldn't do that, he let them know he could.  Since he hadn't officially charged them, he could hold them for 24 hours before he had to charge them or let them go! (plenty of time to hold the memorial service). I guess Westboro didn't think it through too well...  This is Texas.  As quickly as we fry people down here, did they really think they would be allowed to show that kind of disrespect?? Their photos were also released to the other small towns surrounding West, where services would be denied to them. Sometimes you just have to admire the way we do things down here in Texas!<br /> <br /> Thanks, XXXX XXXXXX"</em></div><br />"Westboro" refers to Westboro Baptist Church, which has gained noteriety recently through a number of inflammatory statements, and controversial protests at veterans' funerals and other events.&nbsp; "West" refers, of course, to the town of West, Texas, where there was a fertilizer plant explosion, resulting in the loss of many lives.&nbsp; Although I don't know anyone personally from West, I always think of that little town fondly.&nbsp; When I studied at Baylor University, any time I was driving back up home and went through West early enough, I would stop at this little Czech bakery and pick up some pastries.<br /><br />Doing a little more research (very little, really - it IS Monday morning), I found that there is disagreement over whether the detainment of any WBC members/protestors actually occurred.&nbsp; I don't have any verification one way or the other at this time.&nbsp; Snopes.com says it's <em>probably</em> not true, and here's their link.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/wbctexas.asp">http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/wbctexas.asp</a><br /><br />That being said, I would like to make something clear regarding this issue.&nbsp; I am a believer in Christ.&nbsp; Although I belong to a non-denominational evangelical church now, doctrinally I am a Baptist.&nbsp; As such, I am continually sickened and appalled by some of the things I have heard attributed to the leadership of Westboro Baptist Church.&nbsp; If half of the things that people say this church did or said are actually true, then their leadership is clearly not exhibiting Christian principles.&nbsp; They are not "the salt of the earth" (Matthew 5:13), nor are they following Christ's teaching, "In the same way, let your light shine before others,<sup class="crossreference" value="(&lt;a href=&quot;#cen-NIV-23251D&quot; title=&quot;See cross-reference D&quot;&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;)"></sup> that they may see your good deeds<sup class="crossreference" value="(&lt;a href=&quot;#cen-NIV-23251E&quot; title=&quot;See cross-reference E&quot;&gt;E&lt;/a&gt;)"></sup> and glorify<sup class="crossreference" value="(&lt;a href=&quot;#cen-NIV-23251F&quot; title=&quot;See cross-reference F&quot;&gt;F&lt;/a&gt;)"></sup> your Father in heaven" (Matthew 5:16).&nbsp; They are instead destroying themselves as witnesses to the doctrine of salvation by grace through faith, and the sanctification and discipleship of believers.&nbsp; Additionally, they are leading astray many in their fellowship.&nbsp; In this way they are fullfilling Scripture, although not in the good way.&nbsp; Here are a few places where they are mentioned:<br /><br />Jesus said, <em>"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's  clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their  fruits"</em> (Matthew 7:15,16).<br /><br />The Apostle Paul met with the elders of the church in Ephesus before leaving that city and said, <em>"For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves will  come in among you, not sparing the flock. Also from among yourselves men will  rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves.  Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn  everyone night and day with tears</em>" (Acts 20:29-31).<br /><br />Paul also&nbsp;expressed similar&nbsp;concern in one of his letters to the church in Corinth. &nbsp;<em>"But I fear, lest  somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds may be  corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ"</em> (2 Corinthians. 11:3).<br /><br />Again, speaking to  the Galatians this time, Paul writes. <em>"I marvel that you are turning away  so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel,  which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the  gospel of Christ"</em> (Galatians. 1:6,7).&nbsp;&nbsp; And, <em>"O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you that  you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly  portrayed among you as crucified?"</em> (Gal. 3:1).<br /><br />The Apostle&nbsp;Peter also warns about false teachers.&nbsp; In 2nd Peter, 2:1,2, he  writes that<em> "there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in  destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring on  themselves swift destruction. And many will follow their destructive ways,  because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed."</em> In 3:17,18, he concludes  by saying, <em>"You therefore, beloved, since you know this beforehand, beware lest  you also fall from your own steadfastness, being led away with the error of the  wicked; but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  To Him be the glory both now and forever. Amen."</em><br /><em></em><br />So as someone who falls pretty firmly into the "right-wing evangelical" or "fundamentalist Christian" camp, that you here about on the news all the time, let me make it very clear that these people who are going about trying to disrupt funerals (of anyone), are NOT representing the teachings of Christ, nor are they bearing the fruits of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; They have instead fallen victim to false teachings, or have themselves deliberately set out to deceive others, for their own personal benefit.&nbsp; If that's the case, it will not benefit them in the end.<br /><br />Alan Andrews<br />Basso for Hire<br /><br /><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BassoForHire/~4/yi_0lxC-U18" height="1" width="1"/>
