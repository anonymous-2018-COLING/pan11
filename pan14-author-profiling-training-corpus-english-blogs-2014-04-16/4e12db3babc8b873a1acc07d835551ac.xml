On the other hand/edge/whatever, I&#8217;m still left with murmurs of the aforementioned disorders and they still dick [&#8230;]

Let&#8217;s clear something up. Ready? I&#8217;m gonna kindergarten it down for you. Hypothesis: When you have an idea which can be tested. Theory: A hypothesis you&#8217;ve tested and your peers have tested and your findings (and their&#8217;s) have been replicated by you and your peers. Lots of times. Everything comes out groovy at [&#8230;]

Promise. I made 12 of these bad boys Saturday and not a one stuck. I didn’t think it was possible either but I listened to the wise man who is Alton Brown and he didn’t let me down. [&#8230;]

Simple Syrup isn&#8217;t just for drinks. It&#8217;s used in all sorts of recipes and comes in handy for sweetening [&#8230;]

Cause seriously? You can&#8217;t beat that with a stick. Right? (Thank you, Molly, for being so patient with me. Molly&#8217;s the awesome lady who sent me this to review and life happened and it&#8217;s taken [&#8230;]

I like squash just fine (sautéed in bacon grease with onions, thankyouverymuch) but Cara and Ollie hadn&#8217;t ever been exposed to the vegetable. This was a &#8220;teaching moment&#8221; and the kids would grow to love the bumpy, funny shaped, yummy, yellow things. Little problem though. [&#8230;]

I got back into the habit of writing things out long-hand in my notebooks. This is how I started way back when I first started Taste Like Crazy. Cara was a (rather loud) baby then and I would sit on our porch [&#8230;]

I figured listing out the things that WERE going to happen (but maybe she was worried they wouldn't) would give Cara, my kid, a few less things (20, actually) to stress over. Seems to be working. Maybe it'll work for you, too. Even if you're not a seven year old girl.

Just listen. Err&#8230;read. And if you&#8217;re feeling all TL:DR, you can get to the main point by clicking here. This is a rather long, ranty, gif filled post of awesome but I know some of you can&#8217;t handle [&#8230;]

Buckets and buckets of [&#8230;]
