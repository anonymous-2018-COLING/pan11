We wait, preparing to move from darkness into a &#8230; <span class="more-link"><a href="http://alifeitself.com/2013/12/12/give-yourself-space-to-let-the-light-in-advent-day-12/">Continue reading &#187;</a></span><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=alifeitself.com&#038;blog=19312264&#038;post=1285&#038;subd=alifeitself&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Maybe he is struggling with a relationship or family issue. Or she was laid off and in the process of trying to find a new job. Perhaps it&#8217;s a student cramming to get through finals and finish papers for the semester.

If not, kudos to you! But if it is, give yourself a day off (or at least a few hours or an evening) &#8230; <span class="more-link"><a href="http://alifeitself.com/2013/12/15/give-yourself-a-day-off-advent-day-14/">Continue reading &#187;</a></span><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=alifeitself.com&#038;blog=19312264&#038;post=1303&#038;subd=alifeitself&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Everything right now is glittery, glitzy and over-the-top. Magical moments are everywhere you look.

Atlanta has seen its coldest temperatures in decades. As someone who grew up in the Northeast, I can only remember a few times in my life that it&#8217;s been anywhere near this cold!
