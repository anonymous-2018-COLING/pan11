The thesis work was performed at Findwise and supervised by myself. In order not to disrupt his defence seminar, KTH made sure that &#8230; &#8230; <a href="http://jussikarlgren.wordpress.com/2013/09/04/markus-ostberg-subtopic-extraction-using-graph-based-methods/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=jussikarlgren.wordpress.com&#038;blog=52432387&#038;post=67&#038;subd=jussikarlgren&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

This year, I was again part of the CLEF-LOC, the lab selection committee. I was very pleased to see how the new evaluation labs this year included so many more stakeholders and practicioners to ensure the validity of the excercise and how &#8230; &#8230; <a href="http://jussikarlgren.wordpress.com/2013/09/26/15th-clef-in-valencia/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=jussikarlgren.wordpress.com&#038;blog=52432387&#038;post=204&#038;subd=jussikarlgren&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

The very ambitious and well-written thesis reported on a series of very well-wrought and well executed experiments on using semantic spaces implemented through random indexing to process electronic patient records for a &#8230; &#8230; <a href="http://jussikarlgren.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/aron-henriksson-semantic-space-of-clinical-text/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=jussikarlgren.wordpress.com&#038;blog=52432387&#038;post=200&#038;subd=jussikarlgren&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

This has been a very successful project which has collected many or even most of the evaluation-oriented research sites around Europe, and besides being productive it has been &#8230; &#8230; <a href="http://jussikarlgren.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/promise-project-successfully-completed/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=jussikarlgren.wordpress.com&#038;blog=52432387&#038;post=207&#038;subd=jussikarlgren&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

There are a number of deliverables on the issue and a one-page flyer which &#8230; &#8230; <a href="http://jussikarlgren.wordpress.com/2013/10/23/the-promise-use-case-framework/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=jussikarlgren.wordpress.com&#038;blog=52432387&#038;post=223&#038;subd=jussikarlgren&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

In the discussion I stressed two points: to make media monitoring &#8230; &#8230; <a href="http://jussikarlgren.wordpress.com/2013/11/28/talk-for-it-strategists-big-data-att-halla-reda-pa-vad-som-sags-om-en/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=jussikarlgren.wordpress.com&#038;blog=52432387&#038;post=235&#038;subd=jussikarlgren&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />
