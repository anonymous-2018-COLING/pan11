It is on Friday! I&#8217;ve pranked people in the past but nothing too memorable so I&#8217;ve certainly been thinking about clever ways to do so this year.

I ordered a venti-iced coffee with hazelnut to hold me over for the long road ahead. It tasted better than ever after drinking below par coffee for days!

It was raining (of course) and I knew as we departed our barn style motel in the Badlands of North Dakota that there wasn&#8217;t decent coffee anywhere near by.

In case you are wondering, yes, we DID make it! I&#8217;ve been enjoying all that Seattle offers for about a week and life has been pretty crazy.

WOO HOO! I am beyond excited as I am an avid baseball fan. I have always been a big fan and grew up going to games with my dad. Baseball is one thing that has always brought my Dad and I together.

I started this blog seattlesota notÂ knowing when I would make the move from Minnesota to Seattle.

May 9. Nine is my favorite number for many reasons. My birthday is March 9, my soccer number was number nine and Mia Hamm&#8217;s number was nine. Good things always seem to happen to me on the 9th.
