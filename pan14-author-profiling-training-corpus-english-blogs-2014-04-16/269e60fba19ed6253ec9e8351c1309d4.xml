Business bonuses are under heightened scrutiny; soon, making the right picks in the stock market or earning more than $200,000 per year will mean higher taxes. Sadly, the anti-success campaign is being lead by our Nation's own misguided leader; President Obama.  How can a US President, in good conscious, make it clear that any success enjoyed by the American people will be severely and immediately punished by the government and shunned by all?<div class='yarpp-related-rss'>
