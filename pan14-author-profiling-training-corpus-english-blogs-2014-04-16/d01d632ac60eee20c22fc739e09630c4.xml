Brains closing down due to overexposure to plus thirty degrees. There are two boys about the same age as mine outside my window playing in two buckets of water. The buckets are so small they can barely fit their skinny butts in them. Most of the [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=annikaruohonen.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14253230&#038;post=4050&#038;subd=annikaruohonen&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

It is a large unique print (72 cm x 115 cm) mounted on aluminum. I was able to get a good shot of it today in its new home.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=annikaruohonen.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14253230&#038;post=4131&#038;subd=annikaruohonen&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Just like the others, but still anew. I hear you humming a song next to me. I song that I can&#8217;t quite catch. A warm tune that could make any place feel like home. We are keeping still, still as the crops tenderly swaying, in the [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=annikaruohonen.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14253230&#038;post=4130&#038;subd=annikaruohonen&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Striped sky on display for us to admire. Not quite the kind that would make lightning but the kind that could feel like rain. Clouds keep moving north, like a train of thought they wander across the horizon. They will pass in the [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=annikaruohonen.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14253230&#038;post=4154&#038;subd=annikaruohonen&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

It is good to have such summer weather every now and then, not to get tired of the heat and to get something done. I have been trying to revive my dying laptop. No hope in sight. It seems that I will have to get by [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=annikaruohonen.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14253230&#038;post=4158&#038;subd=annikaruohonen&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Cool and misty mornings, gentle warmth and gorgeous sunsets in the evenings. It has all been done. Flowers grown, seeds sown, young raised and crop harvested. Each warm day feels like a bonus, a surprise present when you are not expecting to get one any [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=annikaruohonen.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14253230&#038;post=4160&#038;subd=annikaruohonen&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

I am already sad about September ending soon. I have been awfully busy with teaching, meeting parents, setting up courses for teachers and driving my sons around God&#8217;s creation. And when I was just about to end the most stressful week of them all, I [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=annikaruohonen.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14253230&#038;post=4181&#038;subd=annikaruohonen&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

The gorgeous colors are still here but the temperatures are going down so quickly that I had to go through the closets to find my gloves. After school my sons and I find refuge by the fire place, adoring the flames on the sun dried birch logs. Sometimes this time [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=annikaruohonen.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14253230&#038;post=4197&#038;subd=annikaruohonen&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

There is still hardly any snow and it&#8217;s already dark at three in the afternoon. I&#8217;ve just finished marking all the exams, ready to start grading at daybreak tomorrow. Gradually all things seem to come together once again. All the individual threads that I have been following for months [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=annikaruohonen.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14253230&#038;post=4212&#038;subd=annikaruohonen&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />
