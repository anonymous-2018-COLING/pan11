Well, if you have read the chronicle of the press, you will probably be horrified at the description of "inhuman hours', deaths and suicide in the financial sector. Nothing is further from reality.<br /><br />In the City of London more than 450,000 people work in a very competitive, but free environment. Nobody is here by obligation. In fact, the vast majority of those who would like to join this sector never get the chance.&nbsp;We, in our fund,&nbsp;receive more than 50 job requests for each vacancy, and in some cases, such as large funds or investment banks, the figure is over 500 applications per job.<br /><br />Life in the City is tough, and employers demand results, as it should be. Imagine for a second that the person who manages your savings or your pension fund was remunerated by any other measure that was not profitability. Would you invest in this fund?. Work can be strenuous, but slavery-type hours and inhuman conditions are a fiction. Yes, the day begins very early, at six or seven o'clock. But anyone who takes the train at Waterloo Station or the tube at Bank or Liverpool Street knows that at five or six pm the vast majority of people are on their way home.&nbsp;What matters&nbsp;is the achievement of results and targets, and the time and hours used to get there depends on each one's time management. Everyone in the City has had to work long hours and several weekends, but so do entrepreneurs, writers, musicians and journalists.<br /><br />I'm afraid that behind the controversy over the City's death lies more demagoguery than real concern for working too hard. In the same way that no one questions an elite athlete who trains aggressively or a singer that makes 250 concert tours, it is normal for a competitive industry to have people that give their best. Professionals that go through a very thorough selection process and freely take the responsibility, because it is also a passion. This not only work. It is a meritocracy and competition is encouraged. The same thing that many call sacrifice is, for the vast majority in the City, a pleasure.<br /><br />Of course, if someone does not like this environment, he or she is free to resign, and his colleagues will be happy to wish him or her well in another sector.<br /><br />A few miles away across the Channel, France is apparently the model for many advocates of interventionism and government control. France Telecom, now Orange, is a global example of what many would consider a quiet and stable workplace. Semi-state owned, 35 hour weeks, ... a long-term safe environment. So long-term and safe that it is simply impossible to escape from it. In France Telecom, 35 people committed suicide between 2008 and 2009. Nothing is more inhuman than the frustration and despair of living the Kafkaesque nightmare of paperwork, mobbing, and tedious and pointless jobs. But that, of course, does not generate controversy, because that's what many try to sell us as a "good job".<br /><br />When I came to the City of London I was 36 years, I was no kid. Taking the decision was not easy. I went from being a director in a good company in a stable secure, low-risk environment, to a very competitive industry and a salary largely dependent on the achievement of objectives. Everyone around me said it was a mistake, a risky decision. Today, almost ten years later, people say we have been very lucky and it was a good decision. I have a full life, a wonderful family and my work is not a burden because I love it. The day it becomes a burden I will quit, and I'm sure there will be dozens of candidates happy to take my place. Freely.<br /><br />Working in the City is a conscious and free decision. Whoever does not like the system should not worry, because they would probably never be hired. However, between a free and competitive work environment and a safe but frustrating one, there is something that I have very clear: I would not trade freedom for security. Never.</div>

It assumes with his claim that increasing deficits helps economic recovery, rather than see that such recovery is much slower and fragile precisely because of the large deficits and the cost of financing them with taxes.<br /><br />The nascent recovery that I have been commenting for a few months has a very clear threat. The over-indulgence of debt accumulation just because cost is low, which leads us to the risk of spending a long time stuck in pedestrian growth levels.<br /><br />The argument in favour of forgetting the debt problem is heard every day.It goes like this: What matters is growth. As long as economies get out of recession, and cost of debt is low, governments should not worry, as little by little indebtedness will be reduced because the denominator, GDP, increases. All is fine.<br /><br />This argument has only three drawbacks: the saturation threshold, destructive debt and volatile cost of debt.  <br /><br />. <b>What is the threshold of debt saturation?</b> I have mentioned it several times. The point at which an additional unit of debt does not &nbsp;generate economic growth, but simply stagnates the economy further. This threshold was surpassed in the OECD, between 2005 and 2007.<br /><br /><b>. What is destructive debt?</b>&nbsp;It's the debt generated by unproductive current expenditure, which produces no positive effect on growth and perpetuates a system that confiscates and engulfs the real economy through taxes, detracting investment and annihilating consumption. In the European Union or the US, a structural deficit of nearly 4% of GDP.<br /><br /><b>. Volatile cost of debt.&nbsp;What</b>&nbsp;makes us think that bond yield and cost of debt are going to stay low forever? We have seen U.S. bond yields rise by 64% so far this year and German soar by 49%. Of course, from a very low level, but the reality is that bond yields can not be kept artificially low forever. And that's when e see debt shocks, because the outstanding debt accumulation increases while low yields are unsustainable.<br /><br />'Cheap' public debt is not a free pass to spend. In fact 'cheap' is a misnomer, since it assumes that there is no cost of opportunity in private investing or saving.<br /><br />Cheap is dangerous. Think of the perverse situation in a country like Japan, with a debt of over 200% of GDP, where the country's financing needs are over 60% of GDP in 2013. Its ten year bond yields only 0.7%, so the country's incentive to reform is very low... because debt is cheap... Yet if there is an increase in the yield of a 100 basis points it would endanger the entire economy. Japanese public debt, cheap or expensive, is more than 24 times the country's fiscal revenues.<br /><br />On the debt saturation problem, Deutsche Bank recently showed the impact of the last five years:<br /><br />The G7 countries have added almost $18 trillion of debt to a record 140 trillion, with nearly five trillion from central banks' balance sheet expansion, to generate only a trillion dollars of nominal GDP.<br /><br />That is, in the past five years, <b><u>to generate a single dollar of growth&nbsp;we&nbsp;have "spent" $18</u>, thirty percent from central banks. All this while maintaining the system's total consolidated debt at 440% of GDP.</b><br /><br />This 'investment' in growth that is supposed to be accomplished through astronomical deficits, debt and aggressive expansion of central banks simply does not bear fruit. Of course, many say that the solution is to continue doing it until it works. But the system becomes increasingly fragile and subject to massive shocks with the slightest movement of interest rates.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XVafF4DMCVc/UjRbkF7n0mI/AAAAAAAABNc/L_RYt20aDpc/s1600/Debt+GDP.png"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XVafF4DMCVc/UjRbkF7n0mI/AAAAAAAABNc/L_RYt20aDpc/s320/Debt+GDP.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />These pedestrian growth levels also occur in the middle of a <b>fierce financial repression period</b>. Devaluations and interest rate cuts discourage savings, and push the system further into debt. Money is "cheap" and saving is considered "silly". But meanwhile taxes are raised and disposable income is destroyed.<br /><br />It impoverishes the population in four areas: savings, their profitability, real income and consumption capacity.<br /><br />This leads to a much weaker system, because the fixed costs, public spending, multiplies in cyclical economies, leaving very little room for manoeuvre in hard times . And then governments say it is a revenue problem, as if an administration can be handled waiting for the bubble to return. George Osborne, in the UK, said "a government that spends 720 billion pounds a year cannot be called a government or an administrator, it is unacceptable." Notice he did not say in a moment "it is a revenue problem", which is what we hear in Europe all the time. Revenues come with economic activity, and if&nbsp;we&nbsp;suppress it through taxation to finance an unacceptable expenditure, this economic activity will not improve.<br /><br />Think of Spain, which is showing signs of recovery. Debt to GDP has reached 92%, increasing by 17.16% over the same period of 2012 and above the full year target of 91.2%. However, the Spanish Treasury plans to save about 5 billion euros on cost of financing. Why? The cost of debt has dropped more than financing needs have grown. Phenomenal. The concerns about the European Union is gone, the European Central Bank helps, the economy is slowly coming out of recession ... All true. And the much needed reforms have stopped almost to a halt because debt is cheap. A bad incentive.<br /><br />However, the annual financing needs of the economy are at historic highs, around 70 billion euros. Imagine even if it as 30 billion if Spain reaches its ambitious 2015 goals. Even so, the country relies on an environment of extreme low rates not to suffer a debt shock.<br /><br />But imagine that the&nbsp;low&nbsp;yield party continues, and the Japanisation of European economies deepens. If we, as Japan, absorb the vast majority of our debt, we can achieve the effect of deceiving ourselves and lowering the cost artificially to unacceptable levels under normal conditions (such as the 0.7% of the Japanese ten year bond) Hurray! What will happen? That the perverse incentive to increase spending, not to reform the economy and make debt shoot up to 220% of GDP is too sweet not to be taken by the government. And then the problems become insurmountable, because European economies are not Japan in any sense, from labour to exports or industry.<br /><br />But, imagine that this debt accumulation "does not matter" because we're putting it in our pension plans, in our investment funds and it finances our airports, highways, hospitals, schools. It's the social contract, right? The only contract signed by the unborn to pay the privileges of the living.<br /><br />The problem is that such social contract sweeps away disposable income and savings in financial repression and taxes to finance public expenditure. In The EU it exceeds 40% of gross domestic product.<br /><br />The absolute costs go up because it is always deemed as "little", and the unit costs also soar because the population ages and fewer taxpayers contribute to that imaginary contract. So the economy stagnates. Debt grows. And one day, everything explodes. By then, economists will say that the solution is a devaluation or a debt-haircut, which is to impoverish the entire nation again, destroying the pension funds and savings.<br /><br />In the United States, reverend Emanuel Cleaver called the debt ceiling negotiations the "Satan sandwich" , because among the bread slices there is nothing. The reverend's error was to think that the country can afford eternally a deficit of almost 800 billion, despite stimulus, modest growth and some job creation. Spain's mistake would be to think it's time to relax adjustments because the economy has started to grow. An 0.6% growth of GDP with an increase of 6-7% in debt is simply unsustainable.<br /><br />Now that we see the light at the end of the tunnel it is precisely no time to stop the reforms. It is essential to address the expenses and pay extreme attention to this accumulation of debt, to avoid shocks when yield-seeking euphoria stops, because as we dedicate our efforts to justify every useless expenditure as "small" and debt as "manageable", the system becomes more fragile. And risk accumulation eventually bursts.<br /><br />By then ... governments will blame the markets.</div>

But the fragility of the recovery is still high.<br /><div><br />- Industrial production indices are approaching expansive levels.<br />- Corporate margins are improving, quietly, thanks to exports and cost control.  <br />- Private debt has been reduced to 2006 levels.<br />- Financing costs for small and medium enterprises, including Spain and Italy, have fallen to two-year lows.</div><div>- Gas imports have increased for the first time since 2008, which is very relevant to industrial activity.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-F08Il6cevd8/Uir3HGPX3GI/AAAAAAAABMw/PVMpxupwTTM/s1600/Europe+1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="208" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-F08Il6cevd8/Uir3HGPX3GI/AAAAAAAABMw/PVMpxupwTTM/s320/Europe+1.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F2r0q6DdvaU/Uir3n9ONdjI/AAAAAAAABM4/lsLuCCMynjA/s1600/Europe+2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="163" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-F2r0q6DdvaU/Uir3n9ONdjI/AAAAAAAABM4/lsLuCCMynjA/s320/Europe+2.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div><br /><br />(Courtesy Morgan Stanley, SocGen)<br /><br />All these elements themselves should not lead us to be overly optimistic, but neither should be ignored.<br /><br />Recovery is extremely weak since, at the same time, countries persist in tax rises and attacks on disposable income that depress consumption. And if we don't see an improvement of consumption, all other variables are simply smoke. <br /><br />Unemployment and consumption are the two great scourges of Europe. With all the government support and a highly interventionist state, unemployment in France has reached three million people. In Spain, above 6 million, it has dropped only by 31 people in August, a moderate slowdown in job losses. But job creation is only going to happen when consumption recovers, and that will not happen in an environment where disposable income is curtailed and taxes destroy families and SMEs. The fiscal burden in the European Union is already about 40%.<br /><br />Threatening to raise taxes on big business now is another huge mistake. They've been a pillar of internationalization and growth, and thanks to them we now have global multinationals, employing tens of thousands. But these strategic moves cost a great effort in debt and weak balance sheets.The cleaning of such balance sheets has not been completed in full, despite cost savings and divestitures, and to raise taxes is a dangerous move that creates more harm than good. Because these large corporations are also big employers, generate the bulk of private investment in the countries, and their social security contributions are one of the main guarantees of the financial sustainability of the welfare systems. Further tax changes would also delay the entry of foreign capital until conditions are stable and attractive.<br /><br />The European Union has warned France that it can not go higher in its tax burden, but this week we read that in 2014 there might be more tax increases. Spain is seeking to raise 25 billion more adding new taxes. Unfortunately, as always, these measures delay the recovery and do not generate the desired revenues.<br /><br />The tax increases are not helping consumer or employment, but also do not improve the borrowing countries. Keep in mind that at the end of 2013 the debt to GDP in the euro area might exceed the current 90.6% by at least 1%, and that the state deficits continues to rise above 4%. In this environment of low interest rates and moderate risk premiums, there seems to be little problem, but low interest rates and strong bond demand do not last forever.<br /><br />Europe, main beneficiary of fear of U.S. debt ceiling<br /><br />From the point of view of the credit market, there is little to worry about, because Europe is likely going to be a beneficiary of the fear that the US exceeds the debt ceiling in October. 16.4 trillion dollars in debt, the fourth time pass this limit since Obama arrived, despite the timid spending cuts and tax increases. A problem that is not going to find a simple solution like the last time, as Republicans will not accept further increases in taxes.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.ecestaticos.com/file/4214cd4d4dc41d342350401f1f2af1ec/1378489637.jpg" /><br /><br />But the relative calm in Europe can not mask the huge debt problem across the eurozone, and should be used to prepare a challenging winter.<br /><br />After the German elections, the pressure to accelerate reforms and reduce deficits will increase, no matter who wins. We saw it in the debate between Merkel and Steinbrück. None of them questioned austerity, but the pace of it. In fact, they accused each other of being too complacent with Greece.<br /><br />Thus, European countries, and peripherals in particular are going to have to face excessive deficit budgets, and  three risks :<br /><br />- An Italian government crisis amid debt ratios that are much higher than expected.The financing needs of the public sector already reached 60 billion euro as of August 2013, almost double the figure of 2012.<br /><br />- A current account deficit in France of nearly 60 billion in 2013, and a debt to GDP that is on its way to 100% in a short period of time (currently 91.7%).<br /><br />- A deficit in Spain that, despite the recovery, is exceeding all targets. It was 4.38% in the central state, compared with year-end target of 3.8%.<br /><br />So why be optimistic?<br /><br />Since the problem can be short-term financing and that Germany and the paying countries will continue to press for the much needed structural reforms, it is likely that, as I have commented in CNBC a few times, the <a href="http://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omo/html/index.en.html">European Central Bank might conduct another liquidity injection (LTRO)</a> to help the financial system to face the risk of higher interest rates and possible bumps in the huge portfolio of government debt that banks accumulate. Only in Spain, more than 213.6 billion. European banks accumulate up to 20% of Europe's sovereign debt and that weight is monitored constantly by the European Central Bank.<br /><br />But, like other liquidity injections, the problem will be generated if it is used to give another kick to the can and take this slight recovery as an opportunity to increase tax pressure and delay the reform of governments that spend between 10 and 50 billion more than they collect structurally. Because then we will find the same problem as in previous periods of slight improvements: the bureaucratic machine crushes the recovery.<br /><br />Olympics<br /><br />On Friday bets soared giving Madrid some chance to win the 2020 Olympics organization, above the favourite city, Tokyo.<br /><br />For Spain, the possibility of organizing the Olympic Games can be, as always a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the analysis of The Economic Journal (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02407.x/abstract">The Olympic Effect</a> , Andrew Rose and Mark Spiegel) estimates that trade improves 20% over the medium term. On the other hand, it has a cost and means a debt that will probably be very hard to add, even if most of the infrastructure is already built. But if most of it is built there ill be little impact on employment and growth. The Madrid bid is sold as a "low cost" one ith an estimated budget of 1.6 billion euro. Even if that figure is doubled, it's a small percentage of GDP and groth. We'll see.<br /><br />Of the countries that have hosted Olympic Games since 1976, exactly half generated a net profit, and the other half, either lost money or barely broke even. In the UK the cost fell at almost 9 billion pounds and generated a positive impact on the economy of more or less the same amount, about 8 billion, according to the BBC; 8.8 billion according to the Mayor of London.<br /><br />In any case, with or without Olympics, there are reasons to believe in the Spanish recovery, as I said in my article <a href="http://energyandmoney.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/spain-bottoming-out.html">"Spain, Bottoming Out"</a> , and we should not overlook the positive data in Europe, but growth will not return until disposable income improves. And if the tax burden is increased, it is not good news.</div></div>

It was a quiet event, without fanfare or big accusations. There were no negative comments to the policies of budget cuts, rather the opposite. Commenting this with German friends, they told me: "The obsession with the so-called austerity is a problem in other countries, here people understand that budgets must be balanced".<br /><br />Merkel ended the debate with a speech that included an interesting sentence: "It's been four good years ". Counting&nbsp;with a public account surplus, expected growth of 1.7% in 2014, and the lowest level of unemployment in decades, 6.8%, she&nbsp;was right. <br /><br /><img height="312" src="http://www.ecestaticos.com/file/666e0c69d649f47e176c536a616844f4/1379697000.png" width="400" /><br /><br />The elections, even&nbsp;with&nbsp;different combinations of coalition, will be, with high probability, a success for Merkel. And that's good. None of the major parties, even assuming a grand coalition, question the spirit of the policies that have been carried out in the past decade. Same as Germany's support to the European project, but there are important elements that have relevant implications for other countries.<br /><br /><img height="341" src="http://www.ecestaticos.com/file/6c1358d846260c70ac5965ea4191f36f/1379697084.png" width="400" /><br /><br /><b>- The Banking Union:</b> the model that is being sold in the peripheral countries seems like a kind of idyllic solution to a bloated banking system (320% of GDP in Europe) with significant capitalization problems, but in Germany this banking union is rightly considered 'debt monetization through the back door" and cannot be pushed forward&nbsp;while banks have still not carried out the necessary recapitalization processes, including the German ones.<br /><br /><b>- Energy Policy: </b>There has been a great controversy in Germany about the huge increase in electricity tariffs to consumers due to giant solar subsidies. After 100 billion euros in subsidies, final tariffs to consumers have risen by 50% between 2008 and 2013, with the green component (EEG) more than doubling. Merkel is already considering cuts to subsidies and there are strong concerns about the risk of social exclusion for citizens after cutting supply to 60,000 customers who could not pay the exorbitant bills. This can have serious implications on the energy policy of the European Union, directing it towards competitiveness instead of climate change targets.<br /><br /><b>- Bailouts to other countries and deficit targets:</b>  a large part of the political debate has focused on the risk of another bailout package to support Greece and Der Spiegel criticized the government for giving figures of the German contribution to help troubled countries that&nbsp;were much lower than the real ones. It is difficult to see the government after the elections being more relaxed about bailouts and missing deficit targets.<br /><br /><div>Germany has accepted huge cuts  since the "2010 Plan" implemented by Schroder  in 2003 with the goal of restoring competitiveness and economic stability, but Germans perceive that the other countries are not willing to take such measures and the benefits of the German policy is going to the rescued countries, that is why 57% oppose giving more money for bailouts.</div><div><br /><b>- European Central Bank : </b>There is no major party that seeks to change the mandate of the central bank, and all seem against the possibility of a further cut in interest rates that could increase the excess of liquidity in the system and the perverse incentives for governments to continue avoiding reforms.<br /><br />The perception that after the elections we will see a relaxation in the German position on Europe is not evident in any of the political manifestos. Because the view in Germany is that there is no firmness, just total acceptance of countries that miss targets.&nbsp;</div><div><br />Of course, as the European recovery is confirmed, with an estimated growth of 1.1% in 2014 (Eurozone), and all countries in positive growth territory in that year, even if it is modest, we will see less need for aggressive budget cuts and austerity measures. However, reforms are still needed, especially with countries that spend up to 20% more than they collect.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The German model has been much more effective to get out of the crisis than the French proposals to spend its way out of recession. In 2013, France will generate an additional deficit of 4% of GDP, with unemployment topping 10.9%, while Germany generates surplus and lowest unemployment in decades. It's interesting, because Germany and France had similar deficits and debt levels only ten years ago. Germany took the path of reforms and France decided to "stand and wait".</div><div><br />The big hurdle is job creation. Germany launched the mini-jobs program and achieved two objectives, switching low-productivity sector jobs into new ones, providing training from a work environment, and secondly reduce unemployment to 6.8%. It was a positive formula to relocate employees out of declining sectors into high productivity ones.<br /><br />Another obstacle to job creation is the excessive tax burden, close to 52%. In these elections Angela Merkel's proposal is to lower taxes after many years of budget adjustments. <br /><br /><img height="327" src="http://www.ecestaticos.com/file/a942d3f33324c899674976ebd614be0d/1379697843.png" width="400" /><br /><br />Germany is nothing without the rest of Europe, and vice versa. It is the second country after France for peripheral exports. This trade should continue to bring Europe out of recession and back into growth.</div><div><br />The German commitment to support Europe will stand firm no matter who wins. But it will not be a blank cheque like that of 2008, which led the EU to spend 1.5% of GDP in stimulus to destroy four million and a half jobs.<br /><br />Germany experienced the mistake of those stimulus plans in 2008 and in June 2010 introduced the largest spending cut plan in sixty years, the Zukunftspaket (package of measures for the future) along with a medium-term financial plan (2010-2014), which included cuts to achieve a maximum 0.35% deficit. More than a third of those cuts occurred in the social security and public administration.</div><div><br />Despite the crisis, the government deficit fell from 4.3% in 2010 to a surplus of 0.2% in 2012. And having met the objectives of 2014 more than two years early, finance minister Bertrand Benoit announced new cuts of 6.1 billion euros in July this year. The policy of keeping reforms is absolutely essential for a strong Europe, to avoid a collection of oversized governments in indebted and inefficient countries.<br /><br />The German elections, if Merkel wins, will provide continuity for the rest of Europe. And that's good. The recovery process cannot be achieved by adding debt and deficits all over. It has to be made surpassing individual goals ... This is how the European Union strengthens. The policy of fiscal prudence, wrongly called austerity, must continue.</div><div><br /></div></div>

Zig Ziglar</blockquote><br />I have mentioned in interviews for a few&nbsp;months that indicators show that Spain is bottoming out and showing signs of improvement. Nobody can deny that in the past I have always doubted the so-called "green shoots", but this year the encouraging data accumulation is significant.<br /><br />It is worth noting two things:<br /><div><br />. Positive data begins to seem plausible for the investment community , wary of the eternal "we are improving" messages of our country that end up being mirages.The UBS report "Spain is getting better" is a relevant example.</div><div><br /></div><div>. We must avoid the risk of complacency. The fragility of the economy remains huge and, as we saw in the past, slowing don the pace of reforms and maintaining structural inefficiencies can lead the country to a standstill. Hitting the bottom and staying there is the biggest risk that I've been mentioning for months. The "Japanisation" of Spain and another lost decade.<br /><br />Unemployment data and expected GDP are two elements. Spain might leave recession this quarter with an 0.2% growth. That unemployment fell down to 26.26%, 225,000 less, is a positive. Even if we take the data with all the caution in the world and knowing that unemployment is still unacceptably high, it shows that the trend of stopping job destruction, which timidly began to show in April, is now evident.</div><div><br />But there are other data that seem very relevant. The Purchasing Managers Index was 50 in June, which is the level at which the economy begins to approach the possibility of expansion. Bank deposits have also increased after years of decline, rising 0.46% to 1.48 billion euros in June.<br /><br />But the most important data-point for me is the strength of exports, both in volume and margin for companies, showing how a country can improve dramatically without falling into the easy trap of devaluation.<br /><br />Minister Luis de Guindos this week highlighted the importance of the long-term internal adjustment conducted by Spain. It is very important because, unlike the devaluation of the currency, it does not create a disproportionate increase in imports and inflation. A more durable and long-term positive effect.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.ecestaticos.com/image/clipping/6a761efd3422221d39061443c45a5515/imagen-sin-titulo.jpg" /><br /><br />Spanish exports have reached a record high  absolute and relative to Europe, but our current account balance has not deteriorated, in fact, it has improved massively to be in surplus.<br /><br />This improvement is not only due to the much needed decline in internal demand. Spain does not need more wasteful infrastructure spending. The improvement in exports and margins show a combination of entrepreneurial effort and commitment to value.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.ecestaticos.com/image/clipping/6326f3f1624b9ce079096d7d72039974/imagen-sin-titulo.jpg" /><br /><br />Another important factor to note is that corporate debt has fallen to 2006 levels and that, following general declines in recent years, the country has started to see large multinational companies post better figures in Spain (IBM, L'Oreal, Carrefour).<br /><br />Where should we focus attention to trust this timid recovery?<br /><br />Consumption continues to fall.  It is essential that the government understands that disposable income should improve, not through forced wage increases, which would lead to cost inflation, lack of competitiveness, unemployment and prolonging the recession, but cutting taxes. It is the only way to improve consumption and revive the economy. BBVA's report "Consumption Outlook First Half 2013" clearly shows that importance.<br /><br />Excessive debt and deficit. The fact that there is no pressure to reduce the deficit below 6.5% in 2013 and 5.8% in 2014 does not remove the risk that such amount of new debt creates, more than 130 billion euro. It involves an enormous drag on an economy here debt already exceeds 90% of GDP. Because the current environment of low interest rates, investor appetite and moderate risk premiums may change in a global economy.<br /><br />Administration reform and adjustments . The government emphasizes that the structural adjustment was 4 percentage points of GDP and 300,000 public jobs have been cut, but spending on public wages has not dropped significantly and the weight of public expenditure is still extremely high (almost 50% of GDP including public enterprises). Relaxing the reforms has an immediate negative effect on an economy as fragile as the Spanish. New issuance of debt (€ 136 billion) and net requirements (€ 76 billion) continues to be at record highs, almost four times higher than the 2005-2007 average. If Spain's rating is lowered, the castle could crumble.<br /><br />Non performing loans will continue to rise, probably to 13% due to the recognition process of refinanced loans, which continue to hinder the credit market, but the Spanish banking sector is no longer a danger of being a black box  where no one knows what is hidden. It has carried out a process of transparency and capitalization unlike any other European countries.&nbsp;</div><div><br />The energy reform has raised concerns among investors about the risk that the cuts are extended and perception of legal insecurity. The fact that Minister Soria has discussed with investors, and openly acknowledged the issues of cost and overcapacity in Spain is an important initiative that should be repeated often for the government to understand the concerns, opportunities, risks and consequences of its actions.<br /><br />Spain has made ??progress, but is far from healed, and has lost 10 positions in the ranking of countries with more economic freedom according to the Heritage Foundation primarily due to the tax increases. Now it needs further reform, lowering taxes and liberalization to recover those ten positions and as many more.<br /><br />In the market I perceive genuine interest to see Spain prove to be the first major success of the so-called "austerity" in Europe, which is not austerity but fiscal prudence. Spain is proof that the best solution to correct the excesses of massive infrastructure spend and real estate bubble is internal adjustment. Germany proved it with its "Agenda 2010" launched in 2003, which has helped unemployment fall down from 11 to 7.2%, get the social security system in surplus and the public accounts from a 4,8% deficit to an impressive 0.2% surplus.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I sincerely hope Spain does not relax its commitments thinking it has done enough, and shows what everyone says in London. When Spain does well, it rocks.&nbsp;</div></div>

Governments relax the objectives of debt and deficits, introduce monetary expansion measures, cut interest rates and what happens?. &nbsp;They exceed all limits and debt grows faster. As a magic formula to resolve a balance sheet crisis it is simply not working. Government spends more, debt continues to soar and the citizen gets buried in taxes. Thank you for your money. Look at the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States.  <b>Financial repression has only encouraged more excessive borrowing.</b><br /><b><br /></b>The mantra that is repeated again and again, "now is not the time", "we have to borrow more", "the important thing is to grow" simply does not work. It is not a matter of growth. As we commented two weeks ago, in the past five years, the G-7 'spent' $ 18 to generate $1 of GDP.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dsLZG8masDY/UkfxfgnhuSI/AAAAAAAABOY/l9Fd7BdDthU/s1600/US+yield.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dsLZG8masDY/UkfxfgnhuSI/AAAAAAAABOY/l9Fd7BdDthU/s1600/US+yield.png" /></a></div><br />As I expected throughout the negotiations of the fiscal cliff in late 2012, <b>it was only a matter of time until the US exceeded the debt ceiling</b>. Indeed, this might happen in October. The situation is so perverse that the government spending machine accelerated ahead of the deadline like the car in the final scene of Thelma and Louise. <b>In less than four months in 2013, the Obama administration has added 300 billion debt to the system. </b>That, after raising taxes and introducing budget cuts. And now, as the deadline approaches, President Obama has the audacity to declare that the government "will not allow to be blackmailed" . It is a superb tactic. First, full throttle spending, exceed all limits, despite the economy growing and tax revenues helping, and then ask for more spending. Like a child that says "if I don't get more sweets I will stop breathing".<br /><br />Amazingly, in 2006 Obama, then senator, voted against raising the debt ceiling. Seven trillion dollars of debt afterwards, he seems to see no problem in lifting it<span style="background-color: white; color: #999999; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;">.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #999999; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span>It's worth watching this video from his 2008 campaign and what he said about raising the debt ceiling: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydZTHPkOnvE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydZTHPkOnvE</a><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Uhv4oTI_Mm4/UklJH8nAVPI/AAAAAAAABOo/4PAaO-reuZ0/s1600/US+deficit+.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="157" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Uhv4oTI_Mm4/UklJH8nAVPI/AAAAAAAABOo/4PAaO-reuZ0/s320/US+deficit+.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Since 2001, <b>the debt ceiling in the United States has been 'raised' 13 times, which has led to an accumulation of additional debt of 10.4 trillion. </b><br /><br />The main mistakes we usually read about the US debt ceiling are:<br /><br />- &nbsp;<b>The US is not going to default because they can print all the money they want. </b>However, in 1979 it had to delay payments on debt maturities for 122 million, and the debt ceiling negotiations of 2011 culminated on August 5th with the loss of the country's debt top rating of 'AAA' by Standard &amp; Poor's. Of course, monetary expansion (Quantitative Easing , QE) keeps the appearance of normality, but to quote Richard Koo in his report "U.S. faces QE "trap", "the vicious circle of rising interest rates and economic weakness has already begun". <b>"No country has injected so much liquidity and lived to tell". </b>The 'magic bullet' trap of expanding the monetary base is simply impossible to stop without negative consequences, because the debt has soared and the economy does not improve.<br /><br />- <b>Everything is just political posturing</b>, the debt ceiling will be raised and all will continue normally. Since 1976 there have been seventeen shut-downs where the federal government can not carry out new spending. In 1995-96 the shut-down in the administration Clinton lasted 21 days. The Obama administration reached the debt ceiling in May 2013 following an unprecedented increase in spending from February to July. Give a cheque to the government and it will spends it, and more. In this occasion it has managed to keep within the 'limit' with "extraordinary measures", but on October 17th the limit simply is unavoidable. This time it will not be easy for Republicans to accept another deal that will probably lead to another fiscal cliff in May-June 2014.<br /><br />- <b>It is an unjustified attack from Republicans. </b>The Obama administration wants to spend $1.1 trillion in "discretionary" spending in 2014. Discretionary. The maximum allowed currently is just ten percent lower. Therefore, it is not a monstrous disaster that leaves families in the streets and the state without resources. It is simply a matter of budgetary restraint and to delay a social security plan, Obamacare , that is generating more doubt and concerns about the cost of its implementation than the existing Medicare system.<br /><br />- <b>The cost of a 'government shut-down' is irrelevant.</b> The 1995-1996 one is estimated at about 2 billion dollars of today. In 2014 it could mean 35 billion.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DbK2FFesVis/UkfweOsOIII/AAAAAAAABOQ/GT_TYzomlTg/s1600/debt+ceiling.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="232" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DbK2FFesVis/UkfweOsOIII/AAAAAAAABOQ/GT_TYzomlTg/s320/debt+ceiling.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />The debt ceiling problem in the United States will not be the same now that interest rates are rising, the Fed has had to revise down their growth estimate for the economy and the risk of a new fiscal cliff in a few months looms again. <b>Even if yields are low and demand is strong, a deficit of close to 800 billion and a debt of 101% of GDP do not improve with the economy growing just 2 to 2.2%.</b> The U.S. must tackle immediately its spending spiral .<br /><br /><b>All debt ceiling increases in the past have been accompanied by more and more deficit spending. </b>Kicking the can forward has worked as interest rates fell. Now, the risk of ignoring the accumulation of debt and keep spending is too high, as is the case in the UK or Japan, the other kings of the money printing press. &nbsp;Because there is only one way for interest rates to go. Up. The perverse incentive of "debt does not matter", matters in the end. A lot.</div>

Massive debt accumulation generates greater fragility in the financial system. While global PMIs maintain their expansionary phase, we start to feel a certain level of deceleration. Fitch reduced its global growth estimates for both 2013-to +2.3% - and 2014-from +3.1% to +2.9% -, and the more cyclical companies that have posted results are cautious about the outlook for 2014. We should note that some economies are moving dangerously towards stagnation. Brazil , damaged by the populist policies of Rousseff , with soaring inflation, is poised to post virtually no growth in 2015 and India, with a growing current account deficit and high inflation in food prices, is a concern that I have mentioned before in this column.<br /><br />However, in between investor euphoria, the liquidity trap of monetary stimulus created by the eternal QE and imbalances in emerging countries, we had forgotten China. It is worth analysing some data.<br /><br />China continues to grow in a planned and optically spectacular way (9.1% annualized in the third quarter compared with the same period of 2012). The machine is doing 'okay' as long as the Government keeps it well oiled. It is the triumph of massive debt and central planning. Triumph? No, it is not . Even prime minister Li Keqiang, according to Reuters, referred to Chinese GDP as "man-made and for reference only ".<br /><br />A model of high debt and central planning that Spain implemented with disastrous results in the decade of "debt does not matter". &nbsp;<div><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0c-Z4aOly1U/Um5AEUCR_GI/AAAAAAAABRc/NzoLEt36dos/s1600/China+1.png"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0c-Z4aOly1U/Um5AEUCR_GI/AAAAAAAABRc/NzoLEt36dos/s320/China+1.png" /></a><br /><br />The Shibor (the Chinese interbank rate, similar to LIBOR) soared again last week, as it did in June. The interest rates in an excessively leveraged economy move back up again, despite past interventions of the People's Bank of China, putting at risk an economic system where the amount of non-performing loans and the true amount of provinces' debt are unknown.<br /><br />- Indeed, the Chinese provincial debt is not really known . Analysts' estimates move between $2.5 trillion and $5 trillion, between 30% and 60% of GDP. In the United States, for instance, it's less than 18%. This lack of transparency and information also shows how little control the central government has over <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/top10/2013-08/13/content_29703909.htm">the regions' debt</a>. Maybe that's why it has approved the creation of regional bad banks, to try to reduce systemic risk.<br /><br />- The private credit bubble, according to Credit Suisse , is above 178% of GDP, 26% above the acceptable maximum. Total debt reached 200% of GDP. Remember Spain in 2007? It was close to 300%. And the level of spending-investment- is 12% higher than Japan at the height of its stimulus policy. Investment to GDP exceeds 48%, almost 10% more than the countries that industrialized more rapidly in the twentieth century. Of course, many people justify this level of investment by the need to modernize the country. However, in infrastructure, China suffers from overecapacity in many areas. It has the same highway density as the UK or the U.S..<br /><br />- All this credit bubble would not be a problem if Chinese companies were making fabulous profits and margins were spectacular, which would make the debt easily payable. However, 48% of the Hang Seng Index (comprising the largest Chinese companies) generated returns below cost of capital in 2012 and almost 30% did not cover financial costs with free cash flow. Does that sound familiar to those who heard "debt does not matter because most is non-recourse" in peripheral Europe in 2007?. Net margins of Chinese companies are the lowest (2.5%) of all emerging countries (average 6%).<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fRYmHK1NxEY/Um5AIShtdDI/AAAAAAAABRk/u3yPlOpIwK4/s1600/China+2.png"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fRYmHK1NxEY/Um5AIShtdDI/AAAAAAAABRk/u3yPlOpIwK4/s320/China+2.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />- A real estate bubble uncomfortably similar to the Irish or Spanish. Real estate investment is 18.7% of GDP compared with Spain at the height of our bubble (22%) and Ireland (20%). The ghost towns that populate the Chinese geography are well known, but when growth has started to slow down, new housing construction has soared by again to keep the "growth by central mandate" plan, surpassing sales by 20%.<br /><br />- Aggressive borrowing process. Today China takes up to four times more debt than in 2010 to create one unit of GDP.<br /><br />So what's the problem? The arguments supporting or justifying the Chinese Model are: "You're a scaremonger, this has been the case since 2000." "While there is credit available and the government decides it, China will grow as much as needed, there is no problem." "As long as the non-performing loan risk is concentrated in its banks, there is no contagion to the rest of the world." "There is no bubble, only a moderation of growth." "As long as China grows above 5%, the rest of the world is fine."<br /><br />Surprise, it's the same we heard in 2007-2008 in Ireland or Spain. However, China has huge implications for global credit markets -as it's the second-largest buyer of U.S. treasury bonds-, and for the anaemic industrial recovery process on which Japan depends heavily to improve its exports.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Efk3FK5tEb8/Um5AM92AalI/AAAAAAAABRs/-WAqJrLCp_o/s1600/China+3.png"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Efk3FK5tEb8/Um5AM92AalI/AAAAAAAABRs/-WAqJrLCp_o/s320/China+3.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />These data, as Goldman Sachs ,UBS and Credit Suisse point out in its excellent report "China: Curb Your Enthusiasm", show an uncomfortable reality. The Chinese government is faced with two alternatives: to grow artificially leading to a financial crisis of unpredictable effects, or clean its banks of systemic risk, which unquestionably means to limit credit expansion, and thus stopping its growth-through-debt model.<br /><br />Non-performing loans in China now exceed $88 billion. A figure that seems surprisingly low, as it is "officially" only 1% of total loans, compared with 9% in peripheral Europe or 12% in Spain, but the ratio is disguised by the huge amount of new loans, and the methodology to account as non-performing. But everyone, including the central government recognizes that the magnitude of the problem is worrying .<br /><br />An entrepreneur friend of mine, when asked if he was considering expanding to China said, "China is like the lottery, you can win, but most pay more than they receive." How long can the China bubble last? Years, or months. But today it's not a matter of 'scaremongering' or unwarranted concerns. The combination of low margins, massive debt and economic multipliers plummeting alarmingly always ends up badly. How badly it will end depends on the decision of the Chinese government. Moderate the madness or head towards a financial crisis.</div></div>

Brent has stayed strong this week on the drying up of Libyan exports. No such supply issues in the US where crude stocks have risen well above the 5-yr range causing the Brent-WTI spread to widen abruptly.<br /><br />EIA this week: Crude stocks +4.09 mboe vs. +2 mboe expected. Gasoline stocks -1.71 mboe vs. +0.03 mboe expected. Demand 20.14 Mboepd, year-on-year +9.9% . US Crude oil production up +1,184 kboepd year-on-year. Peak what?.<br /><br />Coal slump continues, now at $82.00/mt, losing all its October gains as ample increase of exports from Australia and South Africa meet high inventory levels all over Europe and milder weather. We would not see switch from gas to coal at a meaningful level until coal reaches $81/mt according to Morgan Stanley.<br /><br />US gas continues to slide at $3.64/mmbtu. Weekly storage rose 38bcf, well below the 5-yr average of a 57bcf injection. Inventories are now 3,779 Bcf, narrowing the surplus versus the 5-yr average to 57bcf. Last week’s weather was 34% cooler than the 5-year average. Over the last month, the weather-adjusted Supply/Demand balance has been 0.4bcf/d oversupplied versus the 5-yr average.<br /><br />A drop below $3.50/mmbtu would prompt increased consumption in the power generation sector. Gas-fired generation becomes increasingly competitive with coal-fired power plants as gas prices drop, and as much as 1.5-2 Bcf/d of natural gas consumption can be lost and gained in the power generation sector as prices swing in the $3.25 to $4.25 /mmbtu range (according to UBS).<br /><br />UK gas is the only rock star commodity... Back at 69.70p/therm, above the resistance level of 69.50/th seen all month. Daily demand increased to 193 mcm from average month daily demand figure of 175 mcm. Despite acceptable storage levels, 4,600 mcm, prices have shot with demand increase.<br /><br />CO2 continues to collapse at €4.63/mt despite on-going talks and meetings expected in November at EU level to discuss strict measures to curb EUA oversupply. The debate in Brussels has already moved on from backloading to structural reform proposals, which could eventually lead to tightened system. Commission officials are increasingly sold on the idea of a flexible reserve mechanism, aimed at making the ETS a more responsive system so that a large over or under supply could not build up in future. Officials seem convinced that such reform should take effect in Phase III (2013-2020) though nothing will likely be agreed before 2015 and how this could work in practice is unclear. Don't bet on the EU to make a big change, and CO2 price reflects it. <br /><br />Power prices in Germany fall (again) to 37.35/MWh and Nordpool to €38/MWh. No real bullish argument either from weather or industrial demand anywhere in Europe except the UK where reserve margins remain tight (clean dark spreads at £26.5/MWh vs £24/MWh in September).<br /><br />In Southern Europe, demand continues to be weak. Power demand in Spain in October was down another 1.2% weather adjusted, with gas demand down 10.6%.</div>

The United Kingdom, throughout the Gordon Brown years, was the Keynesian stimulus experiment that the advocates inflation and devaluation always 'forget'. They talk a lot about Abenomics and Obama but forget the stimulus+inflation-led economic destruction of the early 2000s, and the hole in public finances it caused. A hole that the UK has not been able to dig itself out of, despite carrying out a brutal monetary stimulus policy where the Bank of England buys nearly 70% of the public debt issued.<br /><br />However, to the surprise of many experts, the United Kingdom appears to be starting to recover quickly. It is estimated that the economy grew by 1.5% in the first nine months, with a marked acceleration from quarter to quarter, to 3.2% annualized, and that will continue to advance by 3% in 2014.&nbsp;Given that in 2012 the economy grew by only 0.2%, the results are spectacular to say the least, especially considering that other members of the 'Money Printing Club' - Japan and the United States - continue to disappoint with very questionable macroeconomic results, from a massive trade deficit and debt in Japan, to lacklustre growth and weak labour market, according to the Federal Reserve itself, in the U.S..<br /><br />What is the miracle of the British economy? Probably a housing bubble of dangerous proportions, already warned by newspapers as ideologically diverse as the Daily Telegraph , The Guardian and City Am (" Subprime Britain", read an article).<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HqV8Ds2Lp7M/UndtICQVDZI/AAAAAAAABUc/WnpNXe0-OUA/s1600/UK+1.png"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HqV8Ds2Lp7M/UndtICQVDZI/AAAAAAAABUc/WnpNXe0-OUA/s320/UK+1.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />There are unquestionable positive elements:<br /><br />- The UK now exports more outside the European Union (52%) than inside, being less exposed to the crisis in the Eurozone. Having reached a record high in June 2013, and growing at 3% annually, exports are about 32% of GDP.<br /><br />- Car sales have soared and have almost returned to pre-crisis levels, while in the European Union these remain at depressed levels. The exchange rate pound-euro favours European car sales in the UK.<br /><br />- After the recent tax cuts and support for small and medium enterprises, the level of unemployment reached its lowest levels since 2009, 7.7%, despite increased immigration. In addition, consumption began to grow, with data from Coffer Peach showing sales increases in restaurants (+1.9% in August) and hotels (+4% in the first half of the year).<br /><br />- Government deficit starts to decrease significantly. Cutting taxes, attracting capital and laying the red carpet for entrepreneurs works. And has generated record tax revenues ("tax receipts hit record high of £1bn per week more than Labour grabbed" read the Daily Telegraph). 25 billion pounds more in revenues, according to HMRC. See below the graph of the UK government deficit (-10% to -5.8%).<br /><div><br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-275QsKII--s/UndtPD0Pf5I/AAAAAAAABUk/0zmScFkZGD8/s1600/UK+2.png"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-275QsKII--s/UndtPD0Pf5I/AAAAAAAABUk/0zmScFkZGD8/s320/UK+2.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />- However, all this data is positive but not comparable to the impact of the Help to Buy policy, also known in the UK as the 'Viagra of the housing bubble'. The effects were very fast. Home prices have surpassed the 2008 peak, and they had already risen significantly with the entry of foreign money coming out of the EU looking for a safehaven against the risk of the euro break-up. This saw up to 80% of the houses sold in some areas going to Greek, Spanish, Portuguese or Italian investors in 2011-2012, according Foxton's. Companies like Grafton, a construction material supplier, have seen their sales in the UK rise by 5.5%. Cemex commented that sales in the country grew by 9% in the second quarter. The demand for housing, according to Crest Nicholson, was up 46% since the implementation of the Help To Buy.... And the average salary of construction workers rose 20% in the first half of 2013.<br /><br />See the index of house prices from Nationwide:<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6Ov0jO2bSSU/UndtUejRpzI/AAAAAAAABUs/iPQ75iwRgW0/s1600/UK+3.png"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6Ov0jO2bSSU/UndtUejRpzI/AAAAAAAABUs/iPQ75iwRgW0/s320/UK+3.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />Is this all positive? Demand grows, the economy grows, house prices recover, people see 'perceived wealth' increase, more furniture and curtains are sold...<br /><br />But there are several warning signs:<br /><br />- The guarantee of cheap money from the Government increases the risk of bad payments. There have been 210 billion pounds in aid available in the Funding for Lending  and Help To Buy programs, while the ratio of debt to income soared for first-time buyers from 3 to 1 to 4.4 to 1 (The Daily Telegraph).<br /><br />- Most home sales -over 50% - are made ??without mortgage and sold to foreign investors looking to rent. But there is a lot of leverage hidden in these "yield-seeking" operations. Sometimes up to 75%. Maybe not mortgages, but loads of corporate debt. And in some cases, rental yields are as low as 2-3% (in Central London, for example). At the same time, rents have increased much faster than wages for five consecutive years, leading to an increased risk of default or exclusion, where, even if there is housing availability, conditions for rental are simply unaffordable.<br /><br />- In London the housing bubble seems well supported by two factors: the City and the arrival of foreign millionaires of any country. As a friend of a real estate agency says, "there is always a country that is doing well, and those people go to London as a first option." This is why London has become the most expensive city in the world, surpassing Tokyo. But that 'bubble expansive wave' is dissipated as one moves out of the M-25 (the ring road around London), which creates the risk of 'bubble implosion' as we saw in 2008. Prices soar starting in London and the shock waves reach up North, and when the bubble implodes, it impacts down to the South.<br /><br />Of course, the Bank of England is "carefully monitoring the risk of the creation of a possible bubble." It does not see danger today because transactions and mortgages signed are well below the highs of 2008, and because a large part is sold without any type of mortgage (but a lot of corporate debt). But that is where the risk lies... When those funds that buy real estate thinking of high rental yields find that there is an excess of unsold homes, which is never recognized as you all remember, corporate debt defaults start to rise. At the same time, the possibility of selling those houses becomes difficult because wages don't increase and the capacity of the majority of population to acquire just gets worse ... That is when the market sees the hidden stock of homes.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The argument that the UK needs to build even more houses to cope with demand and help lower prices doesn't stack up. Building is a pro-cyclical business. And demand cannot rise eternally with wages and disposable income falling or stale.<br /><br />Perhaps this time the house price rise is more sustainable growth, as some argue, as it is less aggressive in debt. I would be cautious. This time we are substituting mortgage risk for corporate debt risk.<br /><br />Economic growth supported by a disproportionate increase in the price of houses and thinking that these can only go higher because "we need to build much more to meet future demand," explodes aggressively on almost all occasions. This time, moreover, the risk is in the balance sheet of the government that guarantees the Help To Buy, and therefore, if it goes wrong, you will pay it in tax hikes.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>We have to keep an eye on this risk. But above all, a message to countries that do not attract hedge fund managers, Russian millionaires or Rock stars: Please do not copy the formula.</div><div><br /></div></div>

A method of payment where states can not interfere in the money supply, and where investors can find a safe haven from the assault on the saver that is the increased financial repression imposed by governments and central banks. Sure, but <b>my doubts come when the haven is virtual</b>, and therefore always subject to hacker attacks. In addition, there's the <b>risk of a confiscatory reaction</b> from states if it reaches a 'dangerously high "implementation. 'Free' currencies tend to end up being abolished or confiscated.<br /><div><br />For now, Bitcoin is not a currency, it is an exchange network. Like a financial asset, a future or a derivative. Unlike legal tender currencies, no one is forced to accept it as a method of payment. It is not dissimilar to a barter coupon. You accept it as payment for goods and services just the same way as you use something &nbsp;that is perceived as valuable by both parties, buyer and seller, be it a watch, a car or Bitcoin. As such, its value ??comes from the generalized perception of scarcity, future demand, liquidity and quality as a means to exchanging it for another currency, goods or services in the future.<br /><br />As a 'storage of value' asset it has <b>some similarities with a gold ETF</b>, but it is massively more volatile... and virtual. Therefore it is subject to extreme changes of perception with a supply and potential demand that is difficult to estimate.<br /><br />However, it has <b>no real similarity with physical gold</b>, having no history of transactions in times of extreme crisis. Everyone knows that gold can be exchanged for goods and services in case of a global catastrophe. Nobody knows yet how you create virtual storage of value.<br /><br />To be a currency, Bitcoin must go a long way in implementation, and be accepted globally for large and meaningful commercial transactions. <br /><br /><b>Is Bitcoin a speculative bubble? A pyramid scheme, a Ponzi scheme?</b><br /><br />I finally received a good report with a detailed analysis approach ('Bitcoin, A First Assessment' by Bank of America Merrill Lynch ) that seeks to clarify the risks and opportunities of this virtual phenomenon.<br /><br />According to Merrill Lynch, assuming Bitcoin becomes a widespread means of payment for transfers and e-commerce, an approach to its valuation could be reached through the addition of:<br /><br />- The average capitalization of established means of payment such as Western Union, MoneyGram and Euronet, <b>c$4.5 billion</b>.<br /><br />- The expectation that Bitcoin could capture 10% of global e-commerce, and the U.S. investment bank estimates this at $<b>5 billion</b>.<br /><br />That is, around <b>$9.5 billion capitalization, ie, below the market level, </b>which stands above $13 billion.<br /><br />The first part of the valuation analysis seems appropriate in a conservative scenario, but some could say that Bitcoin, having the benefit of a restricted supply, should capitalize above Western Union.<br /><br />But it is the second part of the sum which is more complex to analyse. To reach $5 billion, Merrill Lynch assumes that Bitcoin would accumulate 10% of on-line residential sales in the U.S., and extrapolates it to the rest of the world. In the U.S. the total e-commerce market is $224 billion and the domestic sector (households) accounts for approximately $10 billion, of which 10% would potentially be absorbed by Bitcoin. If we assume that the U.S. is close to 20% of global GDP and a similar degree of penetration of both trade and on-line commerce of Bitcoin in the world, Merrill's analysts arrive at the figure of $5 billion capitalization. However, according to my own analysis, that number could be much higher if we include companies using Bitcoin aggressively. If we add companies with 10% implementation, this part could reach $50 billion capitalization, assuming other electronic payment penetration levels.<br /><br />Such an assessment would indicate that <b>Bitcoin is either nearly 30% above its fundamental value, or up to 420% undervalued</b>, depending on the penetration assumptions.<br /><br />That is the dilemma of analysing Bitcoin, to understand the ability to penetrate markets that today are huge and where a space can be generated for this method of payment without falling into the risks of:<br /><br />- Being a threat to states and their control over currency and the money supply. In a world where central banks and governments have made financial repression as a last resort to support excessive debt spending, the use of legislation to attack any means that threatens their main weapon of economic policy should not be underestimated. Bitcoin, even in the middle of the valuation range, would be far from becoming a 'problem' like that.<br /><br />- Confiscation of assets Roosevelt-style as we have seen in the past with gold, and other paradigms of government actions to steal the savings of investors in 'safe havens'. Being a virtual asset makes this very difficult, but not impossible.<br /><br />For Bitcoin to be a bubble, global electronic commerce estimates should be much lower than the current maximum capitalization, ie the perception of demand unachievable in a fairly conservative analysis. That risk is not there looking at sales trends of global on-line commerce.<br /><br />In addition, to be a bubble, Bitcoin should meet the requirement of having a rapid and increasing supply well above demand. Bitcoin supply is limited to 21 million by 2140.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p79r3ZHEcEE/UqWlLOf-wHI/AAAAAAAABfk/HuCin9X0T-0/s1600/bitcoin+2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p79r3ZHEcEE/UqWlLOf-wHI/AAAAAAAABfk/HuCin9X0T-0/s320/bitcoin+2.png" width="290" /></a></div><br />To be a Ponzi scheme it should meet the following criteria:<br /><br />- That profitability granted to existing holders of Bitcoin is 'guaranteed' and coming from the additional coins purchased by new investors, ie, to make the basis of 'new investors' only growing. That is not the case, the valuation of Bitcoin it fixed by demand and supply generated by a multitude of buyers and sellers, and sellers have no false guarantee or allegedly safe "return".<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TtL_zdTOuzg/UqWles_NU3I/AAAAAAAABfs/5sQibi9leyg/s1600/bitcoin+3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="183" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TtL_zdTOuzg/UqWles_NU3I/AAAAAAAABfs/5sQibi9leyg/s320/bitcoin+3.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />- That price dynamics is uniform, opaque, controlled by a single operator and providing a false sense of 'security', ie it only goes 'up' until new buyers stop falling in the pyramid scheme and it explodes. Bitcoin buyers are aware of the volatility and possibility of selling at a loss. Bitcoin has seen huge rises in price and massive &nbsp;falls, it behaves more like a financial start-up, an asset where price is being checked every day according to the potential supply and demand.<br /><br /><br />Therefore, it is not like a Ponzi scheme.<br /><br />Bitcoin, for valuation purposes, is equivalent to a tech startup or a junior explorer-miner. Its value only transpires when it begins to dispel doubts about its implementation as a combination of means of payment and safe haven.<br /><br />To achieve the potential and penetration needed to justify much higher prices, there are two things to look for:<br /><br />- The enormous volatility, with moves of 30-40% in one day, makes it difficult for large companies and massive consumers to accept it quickly. Volatility itself prevents its penetration into the mass market. To be a universally accepted means of payment it should have similar levels of volatility to those established currencies or gold. That's why I say it's still not a currency, but a volatile financial asset .<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eHTrYJQGFcs/UqWloGah3eI/AAAAAAAABf0/QaB60NbscVw/s1600/bitcoin+4.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="160" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eHTrYJQGFcs/UqWloGah3eI/AAAAAAAABf0/QaB60NbscVw/s320/bitcoin+4.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />- The length and quality of exchange. Bitcoin has a major advantage, supply is limited, and to avoid manipulation by a bank or state, there is no centralized validation system (clearing) that is why each transaction is analysed and delayed, to avoid double counting. Well, for large transactions this means a wait of up to fifty minutes until a payment is confirmed, which greatly limits the mass deployment in companies and trade. Furthermore, several of the servers have been 'hacked'. One such exchange, Bitcoinica lost 18,547 bitcoins after a cyber attack. BIPS in Europe lost 1,195 after a security issue. <br /><br />When transactions are immediate, safe and not subject to huge volatility, valuation of Bitcoin could start to make sense.<br /><br />There are still many doubts to clarify. If you find it difficult to understand the phenomenon, it is best to avoid it, not ride a wave dependent on variables with huge fluctuations.  I don't own any Bitcoin. I always thought that if something has a gazillion percent of upside potential, I may let the first massive rise to those that accept the risk that goes from 'experiment' to 'reality'.<br /><br />What I find interesting is that Bitcoin shows that more people are scared and looking for ways to get out of the vicious circle of financial repression and devaluation of currencies. The implementation of an 'intervention-free currency' or means of payment can only be positive. And, if Bitcoin or any other free currency ends up being widely used, it may restore sanity to those governments that engage in this race of currency destruction they want to sell us as 'social' and that in reality is just a massive transfer of wealth from savers to the indebted states. </div><div><br /></div></div>

Before the pipeline goes into service it needs to be filled up with oil (600kbpd) so there is a continuous flow once it starts up. The pipeline is 485 miles long and  goes from Cushing, OK to Nederland, TX. Careful, this is a technical and temporary effect.<br /><br />Meanwhile <b>Brent</b> lost some strength on prospects of rising Libyan crude supply as exports are being restored. An agreement was reached this week between the leaders of tribes disrupting eastern ports' operations and the government, which could allow exports from the currently closed ports, including Brega, Es-Sider, Marsa al-Hariga &amp; Zueitina, combined capacity 600,000b/d, to resume on Sunday.<br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The IEA adjusted upwards 2013 and 2014 oil demand estimates on the back of stronger than expected actual data for Europe and the US. 2013 demand forecast now 91.2m b/d, 2014 92.4m b/d. IEA also adjusted up the non-OPEC supply estimates. Overall neutral to the oil price.

Companies will be offered production sharing contracts, which could result in a resurgence in Mexican oil production, but it will take several years and tens of billions to happen. Mexico's crude production has declined to c2.5mmbpd from 3.5mmbpd in the past years due to poor investment. I bet Mexico doesn't return to 3.5mmbpd quickly in the next years.<br /><br /><b>Coal</b> rose to $84.5/mt on renewed concerns of high increase in vessel freight rates for coal in 2014, driving traders to add to stocks. Australian exports still offset winter demand growth. However, according to the WSJ, global coal consumption could grow as little as 2% a year through 2017 in the face of weakening Chinese demand, mentioning the International Energy Agency's most recent coal-market report. Long-term estimates for Chinese coal demand, for the year 2035, range from 3.66 billion tons of coal equivalent, up from 2.29 billion tons in 2010, to as low as 1.51 billion tons, depending on Beijing's environmental policies.<br /><br /><b>IEA medium term coal market report:</b>&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>. Coal demand is to grow at 2.3% CAGR over 2013-18 vs 2.7% previously assessed and 3.4% over 2007-2012. <br />. China is to account for 60% of new global demand, without reaching its peak within the next 5 years. <br />. India will rival China as the top importer in the next 5 years. <br />. Despite the slightly slower pace of growth, however, coal will meet more of the increase in global primary energy than oil or gas.<br /><br /><b>CO2</b> at €4.9/mt stays weak after the market discounted the EU backloading vote, which addresses little of the oversupply of EUAs. The EU Parliament voted through the approval for the backloading of 900m tn of CO2 permits. &nbsp;Backloading anyway doesn’t address the structural oversupply that exists in the ETS of more than 2b tn. Following that another vote is due by the EU Ministers next week (December 16th) and then the Environment Committee will have to go over the details with another vote at the EU Parliament for final approval due next year. The EU is aiming for March/April finalisation.<br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><b>US gas</b> has strengthened to $4.25/mmbtu after three consecutive weeks of tightening inventories, reducing the gas glut.

Over the last month, the weather adjusted Supply/Demand balance has been just 2.6bcf/d less than the 5-year average. <br /><br />Producer discipline is being evident, although not as one would expect. This week lower 48 States production fell just 0.8% (0.58 bcf/d). Louisiana had the largest volumetric decrease at 5.3% (0.34bcf/d) due to maintenance &amp; normal well decline. Wyoming dropped 5.9% (0.33bcf/d) primarily because of a gas plant being shut down for most of the month. Gulf of Mexico production rose 6% (0.2 bcf/d) having completed platform and pipeline maintenance performed last month. Production, however, keeps rising year-on-year.<br /><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><b>UK gas</b> remains rangebound at 70.15p/therm (-0.07%), and I expect it to remain rangebound as inventories stay unchanged and weather is milder.

The larger the outlays are, the more actual savings are diverted from wealth generators - Frank Shostak</blockquote><br />The economic news of the week in Europe have reduced the euphoria about a possible recovery. France went into recession in the third quarter and general Eurozone data is weaker than expected.<br /><br />In my new book <a href="http://www.amazon.es/Viaje-libertad-econ%C3%B3mica-esclaviza-austeridad/dp/8423417395">Journey to Economic Freedom</a> &nbsp;(Deusto) I devoted a chapter to the mistakes in economic policies of many countries in the European Union, because they were copied from France. Stagnation, high taxation and lack of reforms. &nbsp;In order to maintain at all costs a hypertrophied state and bloated administrations, funds are spent on useless schemes at the expense of those &nbsp;who generate wealth.<br /><br />At the smallest hint of a recovery we see that countries, instead of continuing with reforms, decide to relax and fall back into recession.<br /><br />And now governments are worried about...deflation. Why? Let's see...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3vLKosjofmI/Up3l-jsyyDI/AAAAAAAABas/KZmxUaURt-o/s1600/deflation+2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="116" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3vLKosjofmI/Up3l-jsyyDI/AAAAAAAABas/KZmxUaURt-o/s320/deflation+2.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vjv9M7Dwauc/Up3l-nSvsII/AAAAAAAABaw/Izewded0gSA/s1600/deflation+1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="101" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vjv9M7Dwauc/Up3l-nSvsII/AAAAAAAABaw/Izewded0gSA/s320/deflation+1.png" width="320" /></a></div>Risk for peripherals<br /><br />The risk to the recovery of Spain and peripheral Europe could come from an impact on exports. Spain exported to the larger economies of Europe 50% of its goods. In the first half of 2013, an increase of 8% of exports in Spain, although sales to France fell 1.7% to Germany 0.6% and Italy 0.4%. Seems some peripherals depend less on the EU partners to export.<br /><br /><br />Foreign investment in Spain between January and June 2013 also shows an important differentiator component on the past. Foreign investment of residents (ie, Spaniards bringing outside money) is only 4.9% of the total, so 95.1% comes from foreign investors .<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kbEIc9R6M0I/Up3l-k2tIEI/AAAAAAAABa0/43Y2cZ2qSkE/s1600/deflation+3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="294" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kbEIc9R6M0I/Up3l-k2tIEI/AAAAAAAABa0/43Y2cZ2qSkE/s320/deflation+3.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />However, in the interviews I've had this week the question that was repeated again and again was that the greatest concern regarding the stagnation of the EU is the "risk of deflation."<br /><br />First we must clarify <b>that in most European countries and in Spain there is no deflation, there is disinflation due to badly managed industrial plans and overcapacity .</b><br /><br />When you have invested (spent) hundreds of billions of euros in "industrial plans" and productive capacity, especially in energy, car industry, textile, retail and infrastructure, what we are experiencing is a reduction of prices due to competition between oversized sectors, an overcapacity of up to 40% in some cases. On the other hand, inflation exists in other elements, very relevant to the industry and consumption, such as energy costs.<br /><br />The "alleged risk of deflation" is the excuse of governments to justify greater financial repression . Trying to create false inflation through rate cuts while citizens have less purchasing power, or through monetary stimulus plans when taxes rise leads nowhere. Look at Japan, 17 consecutive months of real wage reductions.<br /><br /><b>Prices fall because we built massive productive capacity for a demand that never arrived and because the disposable income of citizens has been destroyed by confiscatory taxation.</b><br /><br />To reactivate the economy governments should return money to the pockets of citizens who have stoically accepted and paid interventionist policies and supported schemes and incentives that have led the EU to spend up to 3% of GDP to destroy 4.5 million jobs and sink the economy.<br /><br />The economy is still not recovering in Europe, the transmission belt for monetary policy is broken, debt, both in relative and absolute terms, continues to grow, employment is not improving and now they tell us that we enter into deflation.<br /><br />First, credit to the private sector still has not improved because all available credit is crowded out by government debt, making the financial system more risky and therefore more fragile against any sovereign risk.<br /><br />Wages are still falling, and to think that forcing Germany to stimulate its domestic demand will have a ripple effect on the periphery is wrong empirically, as we mentioned in this column some months ago, where we showed that the multiplier effect of attracting foreign capital and direct financial investment is three times higher than internal domestic demand stimulus.<br /><br />This disinflation, the European Japanisation of which I already warned in 2012 is a dire consequence of interventionist policies, which lead to de-industrialization and demand collapse.<br /><br />Combating possible deflation risk with more interventionist policies while still curtailing the consumption capacity of citizens with higher taxes only leads us to enlarge the debt hole.<br /><br />In addition, the voices calling for monetary stimulus forget that the velocity of money, which measures economic activity, collapses, creating a transfer of money to financial assets, stocks and bonds, but the collapse of productive investment. According to Citigroup , the velocity of money in the United States &nbsp;and United Kingdom has fallen to levels of the mid-60s while nominal GDP is at 2001 levels. But the stock market is at historic highs and high risk bonds, at minimum yields. That is, we create 'wealth illusion' in financial risk assets while sustaining GDP artificially, but destroy wealth creation and employment .<br /><br />We have to stop the vicious circle of spending, debt, impoverishment, financial repression, less wealth, less investment, higher unemployment and more spending and pass into a virtuous cycle of saving, budgetary restraint, improved disposable income, consumption , investment and employment.<br /><br />Prosperity does not come from unicorn breeding, but consumption and productive investment.</div>

However, in the 70s he sporadically wrote gems like this evocative Christmas song, particularly coming from a person who has never lived outside of California. This song remained unpublished and only available on bootlegs for many years. For me one of Brian Wilson's masterpieces. We love you, Brian!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0BVypgYrxo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0BVypgYrxo</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Somewhere children outside, Screamin' down a daredevil slide, Rosy-cheeked bundles of cold-weather clothes."</blockquote><br /><b>2) "Do They Know It's Christmas" (Band Aid single )</b><br /><br />Bob Geldof ( Boomtown Rats ) and Midge Ure ( Ultravox ) composed one of the few Christmas songs that does not fall into empty clichés, and one of the catchiest choruses in pop history. Although the artists involved have done more damage to the ozone layer with their hairspray excess than the entire coal industry, this song is just perfect.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjQzJAKxTrE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjQzJAKxTrE</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas / The greatest gift they'll get this year is life."</blockquote><br /><b>3) "Merry Christmas (I Don't Want to Fight Tonight)" (The Ramones, single )</b><br /><br />The Ramones were not at their best artistic moment when they released this single, but they made ??a hymn to reconciliation and forgiveness, with a catchy melody that reminded us of their three first great and essential albums.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y5GtaTrPHM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y5GtaTrPHM</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"I loved you from the start/ 'cause Christmas is not the time for breaking each other's hearts."</blockquote><br /><b>4) "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" (John Lennon, single ) + "Once Upon A Long Ago" (Paul McCartney, All The Best! )</b><br /><br />The Beatles, together and separately, made ??several Christmas songs. Together, "Christmas Time Is Here Again", is not among their best. It is a simple and fun song, but nothing else. George Harrison made ??the terrible "Ding Dong Ding Dong" and Ringo Starr recorded several pop carols with mixed results ("I Wanna Be Santa Claus" being the best). But it was John Lennon with "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" the one that recorded the best Beatles' Christmas song. Paul McCartney made ??many, with Wings and solo (which comes to being the same thing). My favourite is not his biggest holiday hit "Wonderful Christmastime", but the darker and more pessimistic "Once Upon A Long Ago".<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8Vfp48laS8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8Vfp48laS8</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"So this is Xmas, And what have you done, Another year over and a new one just begun."</blockquote><div><br /></div><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBsSUptatMw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBsSUptatMw</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Playing guitars on an empty stage, counting the bars of an iron cage, Tell me darling, what can it mean? Once upon a long ago, children searched for treasure."</blockquote><div><b>5) 'Winter Wonderland "(Darlene Love, Phil Spector's "A Christmas Gift For You")</b></div><br />Phil Spector's "A Christmas Gift For You" is the best pop Christmas album in history, no doubt for me. A genius at the top of his game. He might have been a tyrant and a murderer, but he was an amazing producer and composer. As any good dictator, he gathered in a single album all the bands and artists he worked with, and note after note, instrument after instrument, created an album that is still as exciting today as it must have been in its day. A friend gave it to me as a present and I thought "how tacky, an album of Christmas carols by 60s pop stars". How wrong I was. I appreciate it now as one of the best musical gifts ever.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAC3jp8Z5c4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAC3jp8Z5c4</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"In the meadow we can build a snowman / Then pretend that he is Parson Brown / He'll say, "Are you married?" we'll say "No man, But you can do the job when you're in town!".</blockquote><br /><b>6) "Mistress for Christmas" (AC/DC "Razor's Edge")</b><br /><br />If you don't like AC/DC you will hate this song. Loud. Sexist. Politically incorrect. But if you do not like AC/DC you are the enemy, LOL. This song was recorded during their weakest artistic period, but concentrates all the best of the group. A killer riff murderer, a rowdy and politically incorrect lyric and a thundering beat.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mOBUUhsRwc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mOBUUhsRwc</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"I like female form in minimum dress, Money to spend with a capital "S", Get a date with the woman in red"</blockquote><br /><b>7) "Santa's Got An Airplane" (Beach Boys "Christmas Album, Christmas '77 and extended edition")</b><br /><br />When Brian Wilson, composer of all their hits, fell into depression and mental illness, the Beach Boys disappeared from the music world as a relevant act. During the mid 70's, Mike Love came up with the bright idea of recycling part of their flop disastrous albums, Landlocked, which was rejected by the record company, and MIU, best forgotten as it contains the worst songs in the band's history, and change the lyrics to Christmas songs. Unfortunately this 1977 Christmas album was also rejected and was not published until many years later. From this record you can save this wonderful song, combining crazy hippy messages, drug references and nods to Christmas. Essential.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aHGvdamu1I">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aHGvdamu1I</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"He skydives down to the chimney with Ease / Parachutes a package to the whole family / It's Santa's Air Special delivery to under your tree."</blockquote><br /><b>8) "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" (Bruce Springsteen, live single 1978)</b><br /><br />How great is the Boss?. Taken from one of his concerts in 1978, when the E Street Band was in the prime of its strengths, this fun version of the classic Christmas song concentrates in a few minutes all the reasons why Springsteen and his group were the best live experience in Rock&nbsp;between 1975 and 1985. May Clarence Clemons and Danny&nbsp;Federici rest in peace, they made ??us happy for decades. Today the band is still excellent, but these memories...<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rebS3FABeck">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rebS3FABeck</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"He sees you when you're sleeping / He knows when you're awake / He knows if you've been bad or good, So be good for goodness sake".</blockquote><br /><b>9) 'Father Christmas' (The Kinks, single )</b><br /><br />It is curious that this list of great Christmas songs includes many tracks created during periods of low creativity and slump in popular success for some of the bands. The holiday muse seems to appear when the gold records become plywood ones. This song is another example. The Kinks were in a period of popularity downturn but their albums and lyrics were still wonderful. Ray Davies delivers one of his best and most cynical lyrics, removing the clichés of syrupy Christmas spirit.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-oVPVsCqs4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-oVPVsCqs4</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Father Christmas, give us some money / Don't mess around with those silly toys / We'll beat you up if you do not hand it over / We want your bread so do not make us annoyed / Give all the toys to the little rich boys ".</blockquote><br /><b>10) "Christmas" (The Who's "Tommy")</b><br /><br />Pete Townshend wrote the first successful rock opera (not the first chronologically, the Pretty Things own that honour) and within it we can find this little song about Christmas for the deaf and mute boy, Tommy, as sung by his family.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDriHKfb6x8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDriHKfb6x8</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.

John Paul Getty</blockquote><br />Fans of monetary stimulus always ignore the biggest and best push for the economy. Cheap energy. Finding oil and gas.<br /><br />The United States have achieved an economic stimulus equivalent to 1.3% of GDP thanks to the energy revolution brought by fracking. It is a very significant positive effect, both on the supply and demand side.<br /><br />- On the supply side, it has led the U.S. to be energy independent in gas and in oil very shortly. In October 2013, domestic crude oil production exceeded imports for the first time since 1995 (7.74 million barrels a day compared with imports of 7.57 million barrels per day). In fact, imports of crude oil in North America have dropped to the lowest level of the past 17 ??years.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E9rlJ3YySFg/Up39jzAT43I/AAAAAAAABbk/LzR19CoFYb0/s1600/Excess+Oil.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="157" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E9rlJ3YySFg/Up39jzAT43I/AAAAAAAABbk/LzR19CoFYb0/s320/Excess+Oil.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />- On the demand side, although the economy is growing and industrial production increases, technological efficiency is improving consumption very significantly consumption. In 2008, the United States spent 10% of gross domestic product in energy. In 2013, it will not reach 8.5%.<br /><br />At the close of this article, the spread between U.S. benchmark oil (West Texas Intermediate) and the European benchmark (Brent) stood at nearly $15/bbl. The lack of infrastructure does not allow to evacuate and export the surplus from the U.S. to the world, and that isolates the U.S. and Canada price as separate and autonomous market dynamics.<br /><br />The spread between West Texas Intermediate and Brent is likely to remain at $15/bbl. The lack of infrastructure does not allow evacuating and exporting the surplus from the U.S. to the world, and the Keystone filling is not enough to offset the rise of production.<br /><br />Total product demand in the US on a trailing four week basis is 20.1m b/d, +5.6% y/y. Gasoline demand is up 3.3%, distillate demand growth + 0.1% and jet fuel demand is up 8.1%.<br /><br />At 386mb crude stocks are well above the upper limit of the average range for December. Gasoline inventories are in the upper half of the average range. Distillate stocks are below the lower limit of the average range for this time of year. <br /><div><br /></div>The price of gas in U.S. is $ 3.9/ mmbtu compared to the European average of $ 8.5 / mmbtu. More than twice. Meanwhile, in Japan, energy costs have skyrocketed in 2013 and the price at which the country imports liquefied natural gas exceeds $ 15/mmbtu ... five times more expensive than the U.S. gas.<br /><br />Not only the U.S. imports less, but the cost is lower than that of its competitors in the OECD countries. It is the way to energy independence in the U.S. I already commented in 2012 here.<br /><br />The effect produced by this energy revolution is twofold:<br /><br />- It greatly reduces the "geopolitical premium" to be added to the price of crude . Even though Brent reflects an obvious geopolitical risk, it is much smaller than in the past because the balance between supply and demand is very well covered. That the price of Brent is "only" $110 a barrel in an environment of decent demand growth and supply problems in Libya, Syria, Iraq and Iran is a clear proof of how well the market is supplied .<br /><br />Brent price dynamics is lateral, despite supply problems in Libya due to internal protests, which led the country to export less than 90,000 barrels per day (compared to the country's capacity of 1.25 million barrels per day), sanctions to Iran (which led the country to export about 1 million barrels a day, compared with its capacity of 2.5 million) and the political difficulties to boost production in Iraq after the war.&nbsp;In fact, Iraq is likely to slash its production guidance by 35%. Meanwhile, Iran is aiming at adding 500kbpd to supply, but technical challenges remain, more important than sanction lifting. At the OPEC meeting, Iran stated that it was ready to open its doors to the oil majors from Europe and the US, but the seven companies named by Iran to boost oil output are unanimously sceptical about the growth targets set by the country (BP, RDS, Total, ENI, Statoil, Exxon and Conoco).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W_xSM_hxMC8/Up39i9rIheI/AAAAAAAABbY/nyjopag8Dqg/s1600/Excess+Oil+2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="259" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W_xSM_hxMC8/Up39i9rIheI/AAAAAAAABbY/nyjopag8Dqg/s320/Excess+Oil+2.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Not only the spare capacity of OPEC countries is adequate to address specific risks, but the oil price still includes a negative impact of production incidents - unexpected cuts to supply from military or political crises - of 2.7 million barrels a day. If those unexpected cuts are normalized, the geopolitical premium in oil prices will fall further .<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AoHat1S49Wk/Up39ljNV-XI/AAAAAAAABcA/yVdptkF5yig/s1600/Excess+Oil+3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="280" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AoHat1S49Wk/Up39ljNV-XI/AAAAAAAABcA/yVdptkF5yig/s320/Excess+Oil+3.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">OPEC held its meeting for the half year and, unsurprisingly, maintained its production quota of 30 mbpd.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">The return to normal production in Libya could add 1m bpd, but the future rise in production in Iraq is under threat, and I see it impossible to take the country's production from 3mbpd to 4mbpd in 2014 or mid-2015. A possible lifting of the embargo on Iran might enable the country to produce and export an additional 500kbpd.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">As such, it is virtually impossible that, even with Libya and Iran returning, OPEC production would reach 33 mb/d. Therefore the call on OPEC stays at 29-30 mbpd in 2014. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Emirates are expected to balance the market cutting part of the production that they increased to offset the Iran embargo. It requires a maximum cut of 1.1mbpd to tighten the market aggressively.</div><div><br /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W_xSM_hxMC8/Up39i9rIheI/AAAAAAAABbY/nyjopag8Dqg/s1600/Excess+Oil+2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="259" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W_xSM_hxMC8/Up39i9rIheI/AAAAAAAABbY/nyjopag8Dqg/s320/Excess+Oil+2.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />There is enough spare capacity and the incremental production comes from so-called "safe" countries, the U.S. in particular. Of the newly added production capacity in the oil value chain -1.3 million barrels per day in 2013 and 1.7 million in 2014- most comes from North America (including Canada), at a low cost and with an EROEI higher than 8x, ie, competitive and sustainable. This creates greater stability and less risk.<br /><br /><br />It is an environment where price is acceptable for producers and consumers, where the "oil burden" in the OECD -cost of foreign-imported oil- does not reach 6.5% of gross domestic product. The possibility of excess supply in the next three years is not small. There is plenty of oil and the extra barrels that arrive to the system come from countries with lower political difficulties.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Yj2jNuxr7vc/Up39iztnNAI/AAAAAAAABbc/ixuhEvvKZCE/s1600/Excess+Oil+5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Yj2jNuxr7vc/Up39iztnNAI/AAAAAAAABbc/ixuhEvvKZCE/s320/Excess+Oil+5.jpg" width="309" /></a></div><br />The EIA (Energy Information Administration) announced that in the second quarter of 2013 global oil production exceeded demand. Although this dynamic might change, as many analysts expect, it will not get to 55% of the average difference between consumption and production of the last five years.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pZd1vOCs3Ls/Up39jTGQ-hI/AAAAAAAABbg/B63ftyCCRW4/s1600/Excess+Oil+6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="188" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pZd1vOCs3Ls/Up39jTGQ-hI/AAAAAAAABbg/B63ftyCCRW4/s320/Excess+Oil+6.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />In my opinion, the supply of crude oil and liquids will probably exceed demand growth estimates -1.1 million barrels per day in 2013 and 1.2 in 2014 -. Why? Because this increase depends critically on China to continue to grow in a way that many consider questionable, as I explained in my article "Careful with China", and the "efficiency" effect is already part of the policy of the Chinese Communist Party itself. Crude imports from China fell by 13.8% in 2013 (4.8 million barrels/day to October).<br /><br />What does this mean?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-evtutPFWe-w/Up39jp4MMjI/AAAAAAAABbw/1dXjIN_hi3Q/s1600/Excess+Oil+7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="221" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-evtutPFWe-w/Up39jp4MMjI/AAAAAAAABbw/1dXjIN_hi3Q/s320/Excess+Oil+7.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>The incremental oil demand comes mostly from emerging countries which , as we all know, tend to suffer abrupt periods of expansion and decline. In fact, my estimates of demand growth indicate an extremely modest increase, which would lead to oil prices evolving with little more than inflation.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HT1PTbrC1i8/Up39k54rCwI/AAAAAAAABb4/vETVX4KsDfA/s1600/Excess+oil+4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HT1PTbrC1i8/Up39k54rCwI/AAAAAAAABb4/vETVX4KsDfA/s320/Excess+oil+4.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />That the OECD is facing a mid-term future where oil-price shocks are becoming less frequent and have less impact, as the effect of new technologies -renewables- and efficiency take hold.<br /><br />The surprise may be that in 2014 crude prices continue losing that "geopolitical premium" while the US energy revolution continues. A "real stimulus" for OECD countries. Yes, I know, the naysayers will say that oil is running out, that liquids do not count, that all is a lie, that demand will always grow as if technology and efficiency were inexistent, but the reality is different.<br /><br />The last barrel of oil will not cost millions of dollars. It will be worth zero. Because by then, if the threats of depletion were remotely true-and they are not- oil would have been replaced as major source of energy.<br /><br />Never bet against human ingenuity. Even the most optimistic would have never estimated the success of the energy revolution that has occurred in the U.S..<br /><br />The oil market is well supplied and the impact of shocks is falling. I am sorry for the naysayers, doom-forecasters, we are going to have plenty of oil for many, many decades.<br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">For companies, dividends are under threat:<o:p></o:p></span></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB"><br /></span></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Over the last 4 quarters, Europe’s five oil majors have generated negative Free Cash Flow of -$1.5bn and declared dividends of $35bn.

Nevertheless, it sold several million copies. The mirage of our days may be the expectation of 2.9% growth in the United States in 2014. And it also sells a lot.<br /><br />The US is growing. All is well. Unemployment is low. Expansionary policy works. Does it? Not only it is not, but the most important economists of the Federal Reserve are warning about it.<br /><br />Look at yesterday's GDP by categories: The "headline"&nbsp;+3.6% growth hides a meagre&nbsp;+1.9% ex-inventories. Q3 Consumer Spending +1.4%, was the weakest since December 2009. Business Inventory added 1.7% to +3.6% GDP, the most since 2011. In fact,&nbsp;<b>real final sales (core GDP, ex-inventories) was actually revised down to just 1.9%.</b> (Graph from Business Insider)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mDKXDkZIFM0/UqGb1S1eEbI/AAAAAAAABc8/ITxXaH__iyE/s1600/US+MIRAGE+6.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mDKXDkZIFM0/UqGb1S1eEbI/AAAAAAAABc8/ITxXaH__iyE/s320/US+MIRAGE+6.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />The Federal Reserve acknowledged in its last meeting that the macroeconomic data is still disappointing, with weak growth and poor employment. This graph shows it, but the stock market is rising and house prices are rocketing... "Perception of wealth" they call it. Sure, for those who already own stocks or property. Meanwhile more than 65% of property sales are made without mortgage...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Tsu7zyWC2V8/UqGdU6Oj7KI/AAAAAAAABdI/_tiHKJ4zo7k/s1600/US+MIRAGE+1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="190" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Tsu7zyWC2V8/UqGdU6Oj7KI/AAAAAAAABdI/_tiHKJ4zo7k/s320/US+MIRAGE+1.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />The perverse incentive to flood markets with easy money generates a massively leveraged economy (check margin debt, at record highs), moves capital to the financial sector and sinks productive investment. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is becoming more like a soufflé , filled with air . Not only companies spend less, but the money is used to buy back stock, pay dividends and exchange capital in mergers and acquisitions, and not for added productive investment.<br /><br />Between 1996 and 2006 the largest companies in the U.S. (S &amp; P 500) invested about one trillion dollars per year, of which 70% was devoted to capex and R&amp;D while 30% to buyback and dividends. Since 2009 the annual number of total invested capital has soared to over $2.3 trillion, but 45% is used to buy back shares and pay dividends. In fact, neither the figure of productive investment or R&amp;D have increased substantially, inflation-adjusted, since 1998. That is, the 'free' money from the expansionary policy is used &nbsp;for protection, reducing the number of outstanding shares, merge and return cash to shareholders, not to expand organically &nbsp;(data from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley).<br /><br />The U.S. has created nearly half of all the money supply of its history in the past five years, and has lived the longest period ever seen without raising interest rates, and yet the labour participation rate (percentage of civil population of the United States with over 16 years of age or more who have a job or are actively looking for one) has fallen to 1978 levels, 62.8%. Some explain this due to "the demographic effect". However, adjusting for these demographic changes -there are fewer young workers and the older ones are living longer-, the labour force participation and employment has not improved since 2010 while the country engaged in money printing like crazy. Improving unemployment by 'taking people off the lists', as in Europe in the early 90s. Meanwhile, almost half of the working population in the U.S. earns less than $40,000 per annum.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ASW4z68--I0/UqHrOrUoAwI/AAAAAAAABeE/r28A8lYuvB4/s1600/US+mirage+7.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="232" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ASW4z68--I0/UqHrOrUoAwI/AAAAAAAABeE/r28A8lYuvB4/s320/US+mirage+7.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />From Michael Purves: "Payrolls this week report came in with an impressive 203k gain and a 7.0% unemployment print. More importantly the jobs additions drew from a wide variety of sectors, including manufacturing, and not the lower wage and more temporary job additions we have seen in earlier reports. <br /><br />The underemployment rate (U-6) also fell from 13.8% to 13.2%, representing the sharpest percentage drop &nbsp;since 2008. &nbsp; The most significant aspect of this report is not the numbers per se, but that the numbers were achieved in the context of notably higher interest rates. &nbsp;However, there are still notable signs of &nbsp;weakness: the participation rate (despite an uptick this morning) is still in a down trend, and we are still not seeing a significant improvement in average hourly earnings, or average weekly hours".<br /><br />Additionally, personal income decreased 0.1% and disposable personal income (DPI) decreased 0.2% in October.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gevcAogSzlA/UqHs7SISqxI/AAAAAAAABeQ/Dghjwkt_Ti0/s1600/US+MIRAGE+8.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="166" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gevcAogSzlA/UqHs7SISqxI/AAAAAAAABeQ/Dghjwkt_Ti0/s320/US+MIRAGE+8.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Monetary policy is proving to be a key driver of massive inequality, and benefiting only those that held assets or have access to massive debt.<br /><br />The greatest swindle since the miracle medicine men of the Wild West is to say that monetary policy is redistributive and social. But do not worry, they say, "next year, it will be better", "Just wait."

The &nbsp;graph of one of these reports shows how the correlation between potential and real GDP has broken, well below the trend from 2000 to 2007.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BoRFFOs61XI/UqGk2KUEEcI/AAAAAAAABdg/hNw2DhJ7uzQ/s1600/US+MIRAGE+3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="260" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BoRFFOs61XI/UqGk2KUEEcI/AAAAAAAABdg/hNw2DhJ7uzQ/s320/US+MIRAGE+3.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Companies do not invest in productive activities and job creation because conditions for confidence are simply not there. Artificially low rates and printing money may deceive a few analysts, but not presidents and CEOs of companies that have been able to be leaders and global competitors despite any government interference.<br /><br />Tax increases and financial repression destroy consumption, money velocity and job creation in the medium term.<br /><br />Goldman Sachs estimates that in 2014 capex and productive investment will grow by 9%. Analysing estimates and guidance for 2014 of most S&amp;P 500 companies, I doubt it. At best, it will be flat year-on-year.<br /><br />Government cannot replace private sector capex. Despite the low government bond yields and eternal lift of the debt ceiling, the U.S. continues to generate a massive deficit, projected at around $744 billion for Fiscal Year 2014. To 'fill' the loss of productive investment, assuming -which is a lot- that governments would spend wisely- the deficit would have to shoot another half a trillion dollars, and with it comes higher tax increases, more financial repression and... less productive investment.<br /><br />True, banks are stronger and have less risk and government is borrowing at low rates. Of course they are, with a QE that is an equivalent of 6.7% of US GDP as an annual gift.<br /><br />Increasing money supply by 6-7% to grow GDP by 2% is not growth, it's stretching the pizza dough. However, a problem of wrong incentives, creating fake money and artificially low rates not only dilutes the real growth but impairs its potential one. The solution that Keynesian economists offer? ... Repeat. "Until investors give in" as Paul Krugman says. More fuel to the fire.<br /><br />As growth is poor, what they propose is more booze to the alcoholic. Low rates forever. Yes, many members of the U.S. central bank, like Charles Plosser, &nbsp;expressed doubts about the effectiveness of monetary policy, and begin to propose measures to control the madness limiting the ability of the Fed to buy assets and expand its balance sheet, but these are still voices in the desert. If you really think that forcing the machine will revive investment and job creation because it is decided by a committee, it will not happen. Until the job creators clearly see the opportunities, investment will remain low.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IUG6zmYwfuc/UqGnj_HcY4I/AAAAAAAABds/svPT2-Zuu9M/s1600/US+MIRAGE+4.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="87" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IUG6zmYwfuc/UqGnj_HcY4I/AAAAAAAABds/svPT2-Zuu9M/s320/US+MIRAGE+4.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Reasons for concern:<br /><br />- Credit conditions are deteriorating alarmingly, which leads me to believe that productive investment will stagnate in 2014 . Estimates of increase of 9% do not agree with any of the messages thrown by the companies that published results and guidance.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--895TIap2tY/UqGnpPC4OrI/AAAAAAAABd0/UGhAQjLr7EQ/s1600/US+MIRAGE+5.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="209" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--895TIap2tY/UqGnpPC4OrI/AAAAAAAABd0/UGhAQjLr7EQ/s320/US+MIRAGE+5.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />- Deterioration of the leading indicators of job creation, new businesses, corporate margins and capex have accelerated since September and came into contraction long before the government shutdown.<br /><br />- Estimates of profits in the industrial and consumer sector have fallen between 8% and 10% for 2014.<br /><br />- In March, another drama on account of the debt ceiling and overspending &nbsp;and no small risk of tax hikes. With the popularity of President Obama at a minimum-37% -, the likelihood of tax increases to 'the rich', which is always translated into 'tax hikes for all', is high.<br /><br />- The so-called Obamacare -mistakenly sold as the panacea of universal public health-, means about 52 billion dollars in new taxes to small businesses in particular, and the lowest estimate of the negative impact on employment that I have read is 800,000 people .<br /><br />Yes, I know. For the stock market investor most of this is irrelevant. The worse, the better, and $85 billion of monthly asset purchases by the Federal Reserve, even if it is trimmed, makes everyone happy because the 'helicopter money' only helps the financial sector and the state, so we will 'party like it's 1999' for a while. Furthermore, investors are protected by many companies who do not fall into the trap of easy money, because they are the first to suffer when the music stops. <br /><br />I am sure that the innovative spirit of the country will prevail, but to estimate its economic development through the moves of a stock market impacted by share repurchases and 'laughing gas money' may be an illusion. Richard Koo warned that the U.S. is engaged in "the QE trap" from which you can not get out easily or comfortably. As Fleetwood Mac ...

Looking to 2014 I see less supply risks and healthier demand, bringing the call on OPEC down to 29mmbpd.

Thomas Sowell</blockquote><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uiA1F7Stev0/Us_Wuoczx2I/AAAAAAAABl4/zEtOiEBD1ak/s1600/Spain+bond+yield+collapse.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uiA1F7Stev0/Us_Wuoczx2I/AAAAAAAABl4/zEtOiEBD1ak/s1600/Spain+bond+yield+collapse.jpg" height="193" width="320" /></a></div><span lang="EN-GB"><br /></span>Spanish bond yields have fallen to pre-crisis levels despite debt to GDP reaching c100%, a deficit that will be above the target 6.5% and refinancing needs of c€224bn in 2014. The "Draghi put", added to much better comps on unemployment (fallen by 147k in 2013), consumer spending (+2% in December) and added to expectations of an 0.5%-1% growth in GDP have helped. <br /><br />But challenges remain. Debt (public and private above 300% of GDP), unemployment (26%) are still too high, and 0.5-1% growth is simply not enough.<br /><br />. Spanish banks’ dependence on the ECB will fall from the €220.5bn of November but is still very high. In that month the Spanish Banks long-term ECB borrowings dropped by €12.0bn.<br /><br />. Bank Non-Performing Loan Ratio. This ratio likely continued to rise in November (from 13.0% in October). In the next few months, the NPL ratio should continue to rise, although at a slower pace.<br /><br />. Taxes: 40 tax raises between 2011 and 2014. And raised again in the beginning of 2014 to try to collect one billion euro more, increasing Social Security contributions as well, affecting mostly SMEs and self-employed.<br /><br />Prime Minister Rajoy will be in Washington (13 and 14-January). On Monday he will meet with Christiane Lagarde just a few days before the IMF releases the update of its 2014 growth forecast. The IMF could raise its forecast for Spain from the current +0.2%. On Tuesday, he will meet with the US Chamber of Commerce.<br /><br />I read different analysis of Spain's growth potential. Among all OECD countries, Spain is the only one that shows more divergence between expected growth (+0.5-1%) and its potential (+3% according to BBVA, Goldman Sachs and Merill Lynch). This is the opportunity cost of holding on to the 2004 model of state intervention and bureaucracy.<br /><br />I estimate Spain’s growth for 2014 at 1% and assume 250k net job creation, but this is far away from its potential. Only by laying out the red carpet to job creation and improving the opportunities to do business, Spain would attract direct financial investments of 50 billion euro and would create much more new net jobs.<br /><div><br /></div><div>By lowering SMEs and self-employed taxes, the UK did not only increase its revenue collection by 24 billion pounds, it also reduced the unemployment rate to 7%... being a net receiver of immigration. The formula: “business is great” and low taxes. Meanwhile, in Spain, we keep trying to hunt the unicorns of &nbsp;“recovering tax revenues” and telling ourselves that “we don’t have a spending problem”. <br /><br />At the peak of the real estate bubble Spain never collected more than 412 billion euro of tax revenues. However, it spends above 70 billion euro more than this historical high tax receipts of 2007, which will never return. A minimum of 30 billion euro per annum of higher expenses than bubble-peak revenues even if we deduct aid to banks and one-offs.</div><div><br /></div><div>I talk about it in my book “Viaje a la Libertad Economica" ("Journey to economic freedom”). In Spain, tax revenues have not collapsed because of fraud or the black economy, but due to the enormous dependency on construction and civil works which reached almost 20% GDP including services and grids for a demand growth that never arrived. A bubble of overcapacity to inflate artificially the country's GDP.<br /><br />And this GDP, artificially increased by “stimulating internal demand” brought as a consequence a 300% of debt. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The problem is such inflated GDP figure (c20% according to independent analysts) is the same GDP that is used to tell us that the country collects less taxes than the other countries.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Using ratios on the grounds of an artificial GDP to justify bubble spending and confiscatory taxes. It is the same subterfuge of me selling to myself something that I don’t need and I can’t afford, with debt, and then say that my business is growing, justifying by this way an unacceptable spending level.<br /><br />Spain's 2014 budget doesn’t correct that spending problem yet, and public spending remains above 2007 levels, meanwhile families' disposable income and economic activity has fallen to 2004 levels, being optimistic. It's “the public spend aristocracy”.&nbsp;</div><div><br />According to the 2014 Budget data Spain will be spending 10 billion euro in subsidies; 23 billion in “coordination and finance relationships with territorial authorities”; 690 million in State foreign action; 497 million in development cooperation; 131 million in “cultural diffusion abroad”; in “peripheral State administration” 275 million; in “news coverage” 55 million; another 83 million in meteorology (yes, I swear); actions “to prevent climate change” another 42 million; official cars spend raises 1.6% to 240 million; the mutual healthcare, which is parallel to public healthcare, means another 2 billion. Yet we hear that there is no scope for further cuts. <br /><br />But the problem is that we don’t give solutions for the two problems which are obstructing the economic recovery:<br /><br />- A "Sheriff’s of Nottingham" taxation system that is more worried about collecting the last coin and sustaining, at all cost, the unsustainable spending, instead of creating good conditions for economic growth and with them generate more tax revenues. When I read “reform” to “increase tax bases” “reduce deductions” it really means “raise taxes”. Spain is the country where fiscal pressure has increased more since 1965 after Turkey. Fiscal pressure at 40% ranks among the highest in the EU (<a href="http://www.libremercado.com/2013-01-15/el-esfuerzo-fiscal-en-espana-es-el-mas-alto-de-la-eurozona-1276479317/">read here</a>)</div><div><br />- Legal uncertainty perception. If the tax and legal environment are not clear and predictable it will be very hard to attract financial investment to create jobs and put capital in the economy for the long-term. Not to buy bonds and shares, but investing in sectors capable of making Spain recover real growth. If the system is seen ad unpredictable and risks of retroactive changes, long term investment doesn't arrive. Spain lost ten positions in the ranking of "doing business" of the Heritage Foundation (46 from 36 before).<br /><br />- Useless spend sustains a level of bureaucracy whose objective is to justify itself with endless rules (state, region, local) and ridiculous procedures. I recommend you to read the “additional competences” given to the regional authorities or the unproductive subsidies, for example. This bureaucracy and complexity acts as a block to new investment and job creation. Between 2008 and 2011 public spending&nbsp;in the Eurozone&nbsp;increased almost 7% to nearly 4.65€ billion. In southern countries, the most affected by the so-called “austerity”, at least in theory, the evolution is similar: From 2008 public spending has grown 8.6% in France, 4% in Spain, 3% in Italy and 7.8% in Portugal.&nbsp;</div><div><br />However, economic activity and disposable income have fallen to 2004 levels. Instead of considering that spending must be adapted to the economic cycles and that prosperity always had come from saving, we start to thinking that an excessive spending problem will be fixed with more spending.  </div><div>To spending there is always a reason, the "position rent" is created. Once this bureaucratic entity is created &nbsp;justifying it is easier than restricting/cutting it. Look at Spain's loss-making public companies. Only four out of 4.000 have been closed.&nbsp;</div><div><br />However, there is never a margin to lower taxes and boost the economy. There is nothing more permanent than a “temporal” raise of taxes. Then, when the country gets into depression, the "solution offered" is more public spending as the “way out of the crisis” which has been created by excessive spending in the first place.&nbsp;</div><div><br />Everyone sees the enormous potential of Spain. Growing 1% in 2014 its fine. Thinking that this is enough and we don’t have to reduce more superfluous spending is dangerous. <br /><br />2014 will be much better than consensus estimates. I don’t doubt it. But it could be much better. There is a huge potential and, if Spain wants, it can surpass it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Further read: "Spain, bottoming out"&nbsp;<a href="http://energyandmoney.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/spain-bottoming-out.html">http://energyandmoney.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/spain-bottoming-out.html</a></div></div>

Well, if you have read the chronicle of the press, you will probably be horrified at the description of "inhuman hours', deaths and suicide in the financial sector. Nothing is further from reality.<br /><br />In the City of London more than 450,000 people work in a very competitive, but free environment. Nobody is here by obligation. In fact, the vast majority of those who would like to join this sector never get the chance.&nbsp;We, in our fund,&nbsp;receive more than 50 job requests for each vacancy, and in some cases, such as large funds or investment banks, the figure is over 500 applications per job.<br /><br />Life in the City is tough, and employers demand results, as it should be. Imagine for a second that the person who manages your savings or your pension fund was remunerated by any other measure that was not profitability. Would you invest in this fund?. Work can be strenuous, but slavery-type hours and inhuman conditions are a fiction. Yes, the day begins very early, at six or seven o'clock. But anyone who takes the train at Waterloo Station or the tube at Bank or Liverpool Street knows that at five or six pm the vast majority of people are on their way home.&nbsp;What matters&nbsp;is the achievement of results and targets, and the time and hours used to get there depends on each one's time management. Everyone in the City has had to work long hours and several weekends, but so do entrepreneurs, writers, musicians and journalists.<br /><br />I'm afraid that behind the controversy over the City's death lies more demagoguery than real concern for working too hard. In the same way that no one questions an elite athlete who trains aggressively or a singer that makes 250 concert tours, it is normal for a competitive industry to have people that give their best. Professionals that go through a very thorough selection process and freely take the responsibility, because it is also a passion. This not only work. It is a meritocracy and competition is encouraged. The same thing that many call sacrifice is, for the vast majority in the City, a pleasure.<br /><br />Of course, if someone does not like this environment, he or she is free to resign, and his colleagues will be happy to wish him or her well in another sector.<br /><br />A few miles away across the Channel, France is apparently the model for many advocates of interventionism and government control. France Telecom, now Orange, is a global example of what many would consider a quiet and stable workplace. Semi-state owned, 35 hour weeks, ... a long-term safe environment. So long-term and safe that it is simply impossible to escape from it. In France Telecom, 35 people committed suicide between 2008 and 2009. Nothing is more inhuman than the frustration and despair of living the Kafkaesque nightmare of paperwork, mobbing, and tedious and pointless jobs. But that, of course, does not generate controversy, because that's what many try to sell us as a "good job".<br /><br />When I came to the City of London I was 36 years, I was no kid. Taking the decision was not easy. I went from being a director in a good company in a stable secure, low-risk environment, to a very competitive industry and a salary largely dependent on the achievement of objectives. Everyone around me said it was a mistake, a risky decision. Today, almost ten years later, people say we have been very lucky and it was a good decision. I have a full life, a wonderful family and my work is not a burden because I love it. The day it becomes a burden I will quit, and I'm sure there will be dozens of candidates happy to take my place. Freely.<br /><br />Working in the City is a conscious and free decision. Whoever does not like the system should not worry, because they would probably never be hired. However, between a free and competitive work environment and a safe but frustrating one, there is something that I have very clear: I would not trade freedom for security. Never.</div>

It assumes with his claim that increasing deficits helps economic recovery, rather than see that such recovery is much slower and fragile precisely because of the large deficits and the cost of financing them with taxes.<br /><br />The nascent recovery that I have been commenting for a few months has a very clear threat. The over-indulgence of debt accumulation just because cost is low, which leads us to the risk of spending a long time stuck in pedestrian growth levels.<br /><br />The argument in favour of forgetting the debt problem is heard every day.It goes like this: What matters is growth. As long as economies get out of recession, and cost of debt is low, governments should not worry, as little by little indebtedness will be reduced because the denominator, GDP, increases. All is fine.<br /><br />This argument has only three drawbacks: the saturation threshold, destructive debt and volatile cost of debt.  <br /><br />. <b>What is the threshold of debt saturation?</b> I have mentioned it several times. The point at which an additional unit of debt does not &nbsp;generate economic growth, but simply stagnates the economy further. This threshold was surpassed in the OECD, between 2005 and 2007.<br /><br /><b>. What is destructive debt?</b>&nbsp;It's the debt generated by unproductive current expenditure, which produces no positive effect on growth and perpetuates a system that confiscates and engulfs the real economy through taxes, detracting investment and annihilating consumption. In the European Union or the US, a structural deficit of nearly 4% of GDP.<br /><br /><b>. Volatile cost of debt.&nbsp;What</b>&nbsp;makes us think that bond yield and cost of debt are going to stay low forever? We have seen U.S. bond yields rise by 64% so far this year and German soar by 49%. Of course, from a very low level, but the reality is that bond yields can not be kept artificially low forever. And that's when e see debt shocks, because the outstanding debt accumulation increases while low yields are unsustainable.<br /><br />'Cheap' public debt is not a free pass to spend. In fact 'cheap' is a misnomer, since it assumes that there is no cost of opportunity in private investing or saving.<br /><br />Cheap is dangerous. Think of the perverse situation in a country like Japan, with a debt of over 200% of GDP, where the country's financing needs are over 60% of GDP in 2013. Its ten year bond yields only 0.7%, so the country's incentive to reform is very low... because debt is cheap... Yet if there is an increase in the yield of a 100 basis points it would endanger the entire economy. Japanese public debt, cheap or expensive, is more than 24 times the country's fiscal revenues.<br /><br />On the debt saturation problem, Deutsche Bank recently showed the impact of the last five years:<br /><br />The G7 countries have added almost $18 trillion of debt to a record 140 trillion, with nearly five trillion from central banks' balance sheet expansion, to generate only a trillion dollars of nominal GDP.<br /><br />That is, in the past five years, <b><u>to generate a single dollar of growth&nbsp;we&nbsp;have "spent" $18</u>, thirty percent from central banks. All this while maintaining the system's total consolidated debt at 440% of GDP.</b><br /><br />This 'investment' in growth that is supposed to be accomplished through astronomical deficits, debt and aggressive expansion of central banks simply does not bear fruit. Of course, many say that the solution is to continue doing it until it works. But the system becomes increasingly fragile and subject to massive shocks with the slightest movement of interest rates.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XVafF4DMCVc/UjRbkF7n0mI/AAAAAAAABNc/L_RYt20aDpc/s1600/Debt+GDP.png"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XVafF4DMCVc/UjRbkF7n0mI/AAAAAAAABNc/L_RYt20aDpc/s320/Debt+GDP.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />These pedestrian growth levels also occur in the middle of a <b>fierce financial repression period</b>. Devaluations and interest rate cuts discourage savings, and push the system further into debt. Money is "cheap" and saving is considered "silly". But meanwhile taxes are raised and disposable income is destroyed.<br /><br />It impoverishes the population in four areas: savings, their profitability, real income and consumption capacity.<br /><br />This leads to a much weaker system, because the fixed costs, public spending, multiplies in cyclical economies, leaving very little room for manoeuvre in hard times . And then governments say it is a revenue problem, as if an administration can be handled waiting for the bubble to return. George Osborne, in the UK, said "a government that spends 720 billion pounds a year cannot be called a government or an administrator, it is unacceptable." Notice he did not say in a moment "it is a revenue problem", which is what we hear in Europe all the time. Revenues come with economic activity, and if&nbsp;we&nbsp;suppress it through taxation to finance an unacceptable expenditure, this economic activity will not improve.<br /><br />Think of Spain, which is showing signs of recovery. Debt to GDP has reached 92%, increasing by 17.16% over the same period of 2012 and above the full year target of 91.2%. However, the Spanish Treasury plans to save about 5 billion euros on cost of financing. Why? The cost of debt has dropped more than financing needs have grown. Phenomenal. The concerns about the European Union is gone, the European Central Bank helps, the economy is slowly coming out of recession ... All true. And the much needed reforms have stopped almost to a halt because debt is cheap. A bad incentive.<br /><br />However, the annual financing needs of the economy are at historic highs, around 70 billion euros. Imagine even if it as 30 billion if Spain reaches its ambitious 2015 goals. Even so, the country relies on an environment of extreme low rates not to suffer a debt shock.<br /><br />But imagine that the&nbsp;low&nbsp;yield party continues, and the Japanisation of European economies deepens. If we, as Japan, absorb the vast majority of our debt, we can achieve the effect of deceiving ourselves and lowering the cost artificially to unacceptable levels under normal conditions (such as the 0.7% of the Japanese ten year bond) Hurray! What will happen? That the perverse incentive to increase spending, not to reform the economy and make debt shoot up to 220% of GDP is too sweet not to be taken by the government. And then the problems become insurmountable, because European economies are not Japan in any sense, from labour to exports or industry.<br /><br />But, imagine that this debt accumulation "does not matter" because we're putting it in our pension plans, in our investment funds and it finances our airports, highways, hospitals, schools. It's the social contract, right? The only contract signed by the unborn to pay the privileges of the living.<br /><br />The problem is that such social contract sweeps away disposable income and savings in financial repression and taxes to finance public expenditure. In The EU it exceeds 40% of gross domestic product.<br /><br />The absolute costs go up because it is always deemed as "little", and the unit costs also soar because the population ages and fewer taxpayers contribute to that imaginary contract. So the economy stagnates. Debt grows. And one day, everything explodes. By then, economists will say that the solution is a devaluation or a debt-haircut, which is to impoverish the entire nation again, destroying the pension funds and savings.<br /><br />In the United States, reverend Emanuel Cleaver called the debt ceiling negotiations the "Satan sandwich" , because among the bread slices there is nothing. The reverend's error was to think that the country can afford eternally a deficit of almost 800 billion, despite stimulus, modest growth and some job creation. Spain's mistake would be to think it's time to relax adjustments because the economy has started to grow. An 0.6% growth of GDP with an increase of 6-7% in debt is simply unsustainable.<br /><br />Now that we see the light at the end of the tunnel it is precisely no time to stop the reforms. It is essential to address the expenses and pay extreme attention to this accumulation of debt, to avoid shocks when yield-seeking euphoria stops, because as we dedicate our efforts to justify every useless expenditure as "small" and debt as "manageable", the system becomes more fragile. And risk accumulation eventually bursts.<br /><br />By then ... governments will blame the markets.</div>

And if we don't see an improvement of consumption, all other variables are simply smoke. <br /><br />Unemployment and consumption are the two great scourges of Europe. With all the government support and a highly interventionist state, unemployment in France has reached three million people. In Spain, above 6 million, it has dropped only by 31 people in August, a moderate slowdown in job losses. But job creation is only going to happen when consumption recovers, and that will not happen in an environment where disposable income is curtailed and taxes destroy families and SMEs. The fiscal burden in the European Union is already about 40%.<br /><br />Threatening to raise taxes on big business now is another huge mistake. They've been a pillar of internationalization and growth, and thanks to them we now have global multinationals, employing tens of thousands. But these strategic moves cost a great effort in debt and weak balance sheets.The cleaning of such balance sheets has not been completed in full, despite cost savings and divestitures, and to raise taxes is a dangerous move that creates more harm than good. Because these large corporations are also big employers, generate the bulk of private investment in the countries, and their social security contributions are one of the main guarantees of the financial sustainability of the welfare systems. Further tax changes would also delay the entry of foreign capital until conditions are stable and attractive.<br /><br />The European Union has warned France that it can not go higher in its tax burden, but this week we read that in 2014 there might be more tax increases. Spain is seeking to raise 25 billion more adding new taxes. Unfortunately, as always, these measures delay the recovery and do not generate the desired revenues.<br /><br />The tax increases are not helping consumer or employment, but also do not improve the borrowing countries. Keep in mind that at the end of 2013 the debt to GDP in the euro area might exceed the current 90.6% by at least 1%, and that the state deficits continues to rise above 4%. In this environment of low interest rates and moderate risk premiums, there seems to be little problem, but low interest rates and strong bond demand do not last forever.<br /><br />Europe, main beneficiary of fear of U.S. debt ceiling<br /><br />From the point of view of the credit market, there is little to worry about, because Europe is likely going to be a beneficiary of the fear that the US exceeds the debt ceiling in October. 16.4 trillion dollars in debt, the fourth time pass this limit since Obama arrived, despite the timid spending cuts and tax increases. A problem that is not going to find a simple solution like the last time, as Republicans will not accept further increases in taxes.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.ecestaticos.com/file/4214cd4d4dc41d342350401f1f2af1ec/1378489637.jpg" /><br /><br />But the relative calm in Europe can not mask the huge debt problem across the eurozone, and should be used to prepare a challenging winter.<br /><br />After the German elections, the pressure to accelerate reforms and reduce deficits will increase, no matter who wins. We saw it in the debate between Merkel and Steinbrück. None of them questioned austerity, but the pace of it. In fact, they accused each other of being too complacent with Greece.<br /><br />Thus, European countries, and peripherals in particular are going to have to face excessive deficit budgets, and  three risks :<br /><br />- An Italian government crisis amid debt ratios that are much higher than expected.The financing needs of the public sector already reached 60 billion euro as of August 2013, almost double the figure of 2012.<br /><br />- A current account deficit in France of nearly 60 billion in 2013, and a debt to GDP that is on its way to 100% in a short period of time (currently 91.7%).<br /><br />- A deficit in Spain that, despite the recovery, is exceeding all targets. It was 4.38% in the central state, compared with year-end target of 3.8%.<br /><br />So why be optimistic?<br /><br />Since the problem can be short-term financing and that Germany and the paying countries will continue to press for the much needed structural reforms, it is likely that, as I have commented in CNBC a few times, the <a href="http://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omo/html/index.en.html">European Central Bank might conduct another liquidity injection (LTRO)</a> to help the financial system to face the risk of higher interest rates and possible bumps in the huge portfolio of government debt that banks accumulate. Only in Spain, more than 213.6 billion. European banks accumulate up to 20% of Europe's sovereign debt and that weight is monitored constantly by the European Central Bank.<br /><br />But, like other liquidity injections, the problem will be generated if it is used to give another kick to the can and take this slight recovery as an opportunity to increase tax pressure and delay the reform of governments that spend between 10 and 50 billion more than they collect structurally. Because then we will find the same problem as in previous periods of slight improvements: the bureaucratic machine crushes the recovery.<br /><br />Olympics<br /><br />On Friday bets soared giving Madrid some chance to win the 2020 Olympics organization, above the favourite city, Tokyo.<br /><br />For Spain, the possibility of organizing the Olympic Games can be, as always a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the analysis of The Economic Journal (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02407.x/abstract">The Olympic Effect</a> , Andrew Rose and Mark Spiegel) estimates that trade improves 20% over the medium term. On the other hand, it has a cost and means a debt that will probably be very hard to add, even if most of the infrastructure is already built. But if most of it is built there ill be little impact on employment and growth. The Madrid bid is sold as a "low cost" one ith an estimated budget of 1.6 billion euro. Even if that figure is doubled, it's a small percentage of GDP and groth. We'll see.<br /><br />Of the countries that have hosted Olympic Games since 1976, exactly half generated a net profit, and the other half, either lost money or barely broke even. In the UK the cost fell at almost 9 billion pounds and generated a positive impact on the economy of more or less the same amount, about 8 billion, according to the BBC; 8.8 billion according to the Mayor of London.<br /><br />In any case, with or without Olympics, there are reasons to believe in the Spanish recovery, as I said in my article <a href="http://energyandmoney.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/spain-bottoming-out.html">"Spain, Bottoming Out"</a> , and we should not overlook the positive data in Europe, but growth will not return until disposable income improves. And if the tax burden is increased, it is not good news.</div></div>

It was a quiet event, without fanfare or big accusations. There were no negative comments to the policies of budget cuts, rather the opposite. Commenting this with German friends, they told me: "The obsession with the so-called austerity is a problem in other countries, here people understand that budgets must be balanced".<br /><br />Merkel ended the debate with a speech that included an interesting sentence: "It's been four good years ". Counting&nbsp;with a public account surplus, expected growth of 1.7% in 2014, and the lowest level of unemployment in decades, 6.8%, she&nbsp;was right. <br /><br /><img height="312" src="http://www.ecestaticos.com/file/666e0c69d649f47e176c536a616844f4/1379697000.png" width="400" /><br /><br />The elections, even&nbsp;with&nbsp;different combinations of coalition, will be, with high probability, a success for Merkel. And that's good. None of the major parties, even assuming a grand coalition, question the spirit of the policies that have been carried out in the past decade. Same as Germany's support to the European project, but there are important elements that have relevant implications for other countries.<br /><br /><img height="341" src="http://www.ecestaticos.com/file/6c1358d846260c70ac5965ea4191f36f/1379697084.png" width="400" /><br /><br /><b>- The Banking Union:</b> the model that is being sold in the peripheral countries seems like a kind of idyllic solution to a bloated banking system (320% of GDP in Europe) with significant capitalization problems, but in Germany this banking union is rightly considered 'debt monetization through the back door" and cannot be pushed forward&nbsp;while banks have still not carried out the necessary recapitalization processes, including the German ones.<br /><br /><b>- Energy Policy: </b>There has been a great controversy in Germany about the huge increase in electricity tariffs to consumers due to giant solar subsidies. After 100 billion euros in subsidies, final tariffs to consumers have risen by 50% between 2008 and 2013, with the green component (EEG) more than doubling. Merkel is already considering cuts to subsidies and there are strong concerns about the risk of social exclusion for citizens after cutting supply to 60,000 customers who could not pay the exorbitant bills. This can have serious implications on the energy policy of the European Union, directing it towards competitiveness instead of climate change targets.<br /><br /><b>- Bailouts to other countries and deficit targets:</b>  a large part of the political debate has focused on the risk of another bailout package to support Greece and Der Spiegel criticized the government for giving figures of the German contribution to help troubled countries that&nbsp;were much lower than the real ones. It is difficult to see the government after the elections being more relaxed about bailouts and missing deficit targets.<br /><br /><div>Germany has accepted huge cuts  since the "2010 Plan" implemented by Schroder  in 2003 with the goal of restoring competitiveness and economic stability, but Germans perceive that the other countries are not willing to take such measures and the benefits of the German policy is going to the rescued countries, that is why 57% oppose giving more money for bailouts.</div><div><br /><b>- European Central Bank : </b>There is no major party that seeks to change the mandate of the central bank, and all seem against the possibility of a further cut in interest rates that could increase the excess of liquidity in the system and the perverse incentives for governments to continue avoiding reforms.<br /><br />The perception that after the elections we will see a relaxation in the German position on Europe is not evident in any of the political manifestos. Because the view in Germany is that there is no firmness, just total acceptance of countries that miss targets.&nbsp;</div><div><br />Of course, as the European recovery is confirmed, with an estimated growth of 1.1% in 2014 (Eurozone), and all countries in positive growth territory in that year, even if it is modest, we will see less need for aggressive budget cuts and austerity measures. However, reforms are still needed, especially with countries that spend up to 20% more than they collect.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The German model has been much more effective to get out of the crisis than the French proposals to spend its way out of recession. In 2013, France will generate an additional deficit of 4% of GDP, with unemployment topping 10.9%, while Germany generates surplus and lowest unemployment in decades. It's interesting, because Germany and France had similar deficits and debt levels only ten years ago. Germany took the path of reforms and France decided to "stand and wait".</div><div><br />The big hurdle is job creation. Germany launched the mini-jobs program and achieved two objectives, switching low-productivity sector jobs into new ones, providing training from a work environment, and secondly reduce unemployment to 6.8%. It was a positive formula to relocate employees out of declining sectors into high productivity ones.<br /><br />Another obstacle to job creation is the excessive tax burden, close to 52%. In these elections Angela Merkel's proposal is to lower taxes after many years of budget adjustments. <br /><br /><img height="327" src="http://www.ecestaticos.com/file/a942d3f33324c899674976ebd614be0d/1379697843.png" width="400" /><br /><br />Germany is nothing without the rest of Europe, and vice versa. It is the second country after France for peripheral exports. This trade should continue to bring Europe out of recession and back into growth.</div><div><br />The German commitment to support Europe will stand firm no matter who wins. But it will not be a blank cheque like that of 2008, which led the EU to spend 1.5% of GDP in stimulus to destroy four million and a half jobs.<br /><br />Germany experienced the mistake of those stimulus plans in 2008 and in June 2010 introduced the largest spending cut plan in sixty years, the Zukunftspaket (package of measures for the future) along with a medium-term financial plan (2010-2014), which included cuts to achieve a maximum 0.35% deficit. More than a third of those cuts occurred in the social security and public administration.</div><div><br />Despite the crisis, the government deficit fell from 4.3% in 2010 to a surplus of 0.2% in 2012. And having met the objectives of 2014 more than two years early, finance minister Bertrand Benoit announced new cuts of 6.1 billion euros in July this year. The policy of keeping reforms is absolutely essential for a strong Europe, to avoid a collection of oversized governments in indebted and inefficient countries.<br /><br />The German elections, if Merkel wins, will provide continuity for the rest of Europe. And that's good. The recovery process cannot be achieved by adding debt and deficits all over. It has to be made surpassing individual goals ... This is how the European Union strengthens. The policy of fiscal prudence, wrongly called austerity, must continue.</div><div><br /></div></div>

Zig Ziglar</blockquote><br />I have mentioned in interviews for a few&nbsp;months that indicators show that Spain is bottoming out and showing signs of improvement. Nobody can deny that in the past I have always doubted the so-called "green shoots", but this year the encouraging data accumulation is significant.<br /><br />It is worth noting two things:<br /><div><br />. Positive data begins to seem plausible for the investment community , wary of the eternal "we are improving" messages of our country that end up being mirages.The UBS report "Spain is getting better" is a relevant example.</div><div><br /></div><div>. We must avoid the risk of complacency. The fragility of the economy remains huge and, as we saw in the past, slowing don the pace of reforms and maintaining structural inefficiencies can lead the country to a standstill. Hitting the bottom and staying there is the biggest risk that I've been mentioning for months. The "Japanisation" of Spain and another lost decade.<br /><br />Unemployment data and expected GDP are two elements. Spain might leave recession this quarter with an 0.2% growth. That unemployment fell down to 26.26%, 225,000 less, is a positive. Even if we take the data with all the caution in the world and knowing that unemployment is still unacceptably high, it shows that the trend of stopping job destruction, which timidly began to show in April, is now evident.</div><div><br />But there are other data that seem very relevant. The Purchasing Managers Index was 50 in June, which is the level at which the economy begins to approach the possibility of expansion. Bank deposits have also increased after years of decline, rising 0.46% to 1.48 billion euros in June.<br /><br />But the most important data-point for me is the strength of exports, both in volume and margin for companies, showing how a country can improve dramatically without falling into the easy trap of devaluation.<br /><br />Minister Luis de Guindos this week highlighted the importance of the long-term internal adjustment conducted by Spain. It is very important because, unlike the devaluation of the currency, it does not create a disproportionate increase in imports and inflation. A more durable and long-term positive effect.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.ecestaticos.com/image/clipping/6a761efd3422221d39061443c45a5515/imagen-sin-titulo.jpg" /><br /><br />Spanish exports have reached a record high  absolute and relative to Europe, but our current account balance has not deteriorated, in fact, it has improved massively to be in surplus.<br /><br />This improvement is not only due to the much needed decline in internal demand. Spain does not need more wasteful infrastructure spending. The improvement in exports and margins show a combination of entrepreneurial effort and commitment to value.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.ecestaticos.com/image/clipping/6326f3f1624b9ce079096d7d72039974/imagen-sin-titulo.jpg" /><br /><br />Another important factor to note is that corporate debt has fallen to 2006 levels and that, following general declines in recent years, the country has started to see large multinational companies post better figures in Spain (IBM, L'Oreal, Carrefour).<br /><br />Where should we focus attention to trust this timid recovery?<br /><br />Consumption continues to fall.  It is essential that the government understands that disposable income should improve, not through forced wage increases, which would lead to cost inflation, lack of competitiveness, unemployment and prolonging the recession, but cutting taxes. It is the only way to improve consumption and revive the economy. BBVA's report "Consumption Outlook First Half 2013" clearly shows that importance.<br /><br />Excessive debt and deficit. The fact that there is no pressure to reduce the deficit below 6.5% in 2013 and 5.8% in 2014 does not remove the risk that such amount of new debt creates, more than 130 billion euro. It involves an enormous drag on an economy here debt already exceeds 90% of GDP. Because the current environment of low interest rates, investor appetite and moderate risk premiums may change in a global economy.<br /><br />Administration reform and adjustments . The government emphasizes that the structural adjustment was 4 percentage points of GDP and 300,000 public jobs have been cut, but spending on public wages has not dropped significantly and the weight of public expenditure is still extremely high (almost 50% of GDP including public enterprises). Relaxing the reforms has an immediate negative effect on an economy as fragile as the Spanish. New issuance of debt (€ 136 billion) and net requirements (€ 76 billion) continues to be at record highs, almost four times higher than the 2005-2007 average. If Spain's rating is lowered, the castle could crumble.<br /><br />Non performing loans will continue to rise, probably to 13% due to the recognition process of refinanced loans, which continue to hinder the credit market, but the Spanish banking sector is no longer a danger of being a black box  where no one knows what is hidden. It has carried out a process of transparency and capitalization unlike any other European countries.&nbsp;</div><div><br />The energy reform has raised concerns among investors about the risk that the cuts are extended and perception of legal insecurity. The fact that Minister Soria has discussed with investors, and openly acknowledged the issues of cost and overcapacity in Spain is an important initiative that should be repeated often for the government to understand the concerns, opportunities, risks and consequences of its actions.<br /><br />Spain has made ??progress, but is far from healed, and has lost 10 positions in the ranking of countries with more economic freedom according to the Heritage Foundation primarily due to the tax increases. Now it needs further reform, lowering taxes and liberalization to recover those ten positions and as many more.<br /><br />In the market I perceive genuine interest to see Spain prove to be the first major success of the so-called "austerity" in Europe, which is not austerity but fiscal prudence. Spain is proof that the best solution to correct the excesses of massive infrastructure spend and real estate bubble is internal adjustment. Germany proved it with its "Agenda 2010" launched in 2003, which has helped unemployment fall down from 11 to 7.2%, get the social security system in surplus and the public accounts from a 4,8% deficit to an impressive 0.2% surplus.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I sincerely hope Spain does not relax its commitments thinking it has done enough, and shows what everyone says in London. When Spain does well, it rocks.&nbsp;</div></div>

Governments relax the objectives of debt and deficits, introduce monetary expansion measures, cut interest rates and what happens?. &nbsp;They exceed all limits and debt grows faster. As a magic formula to resolve a balance sheet crisis it is simply not working. Government spends more, debt continues to soar and the citizen gets buried in taxes. Thank you for your money. Look at the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States.  <b>Financial repression has only encouraged more excessive borrowing.</b><br /><b><br /></b>The mantra that is repeated again and again, "now is not the time", "we have to borrow more", "the important thing is to grow" simply does not work. It is not a matter of growth. As we commented two weeks ago, in the past five years, the G-7 'spent' $ 18 to generate $1 of GDP.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dsLZG8masDY/UkfxfgnhuSI/AAAAAAAABOY/l9Fd7BdDthU/s1600/US+yield.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dsLZG8masDY/UkfxfgnhuSI/AAAAAAAABOY/l9Fd7BdDthU/s1600/US+yield.png" /></a></div><br />As I expected throughout the negotiations of the fiscal cliff in late 2012, <b>it was only a matter of time until the US exceeded the debt ceiling</b>. Indeed, this might happen in October. The situation is so perverse that the government spending machine accelerated ahead of the deadline like the car in the final scene of Thelma and Louise. <b>In less than four months in 2013, the Obama administration has added 300 billion debt to the system. </b>That, after raising taxes and introducing budget cuts. And now, as the deadline approaches, President Obama has the audacity to declare that the government "will not allow to be blackmailed" . It is a superb tactic. First, full throttle spending, exceed all limits, despite the economy growing and tax revenues helping, and then ask for more spending. Like a child that says "if I don't get more sweets I will stop breathing".<br /><br />Amazingly, in 2006 Obama, then senator, voted against raising the debt ceiling. Seven trillion dollars of debt afterwards, he seems to see no problem in lifting it<span style="background-color: white; color: #999999; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;">.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #999999; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span>It's worth watching this video from his 2008 campaign and what he said about raising the debt ceiling: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydZTHPkOnvE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydZTHPkOnvE</a><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Uhv4oTI_Mm4/UklJH8nAVPI/AAAAAAAABOo/4PAaO-reuZ0/s1600/US+deficit+.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="157" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Uhv4oTI_Mm4/UklJH8nAVPI/AAAAAAAABOo/4PAaO-reuZ0/s320/US+deficit+.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Since 2001, <b>the debt ceiling in the United States has been 'raised' 13 times, which has led to an accumulation of additional debt of 10.4 trillion. </b><br /><br />The main mistakes we usually read about the US debt ceiling are:<br /><br />- &nbsp;<b>The US is not going to default because they can print all the money they want. </b>However, in 1979 it had to delay payments on debt maturities for 122 million, and the debt ceiling negotiations of 2011 culminated on August 5th with the loss of the country's debt top rating of 'AAA' by Standard &amp; Poor's. Of course, monetary expansion (Quantitative Easing , QE) keeps the appearance of normality, but to quote Richard Koo in his report "U.S. faces QE "trap", "the vicious circle of rising interest rates and economic weakness has already begun". <b>"No country has injected so much liquidity and lived to tell". </b>The 'magic bullet' trap of expanding the monetary base is simply impossible to stop without negative consequences, because the debt has soared and the economy does not improve.<br /><br />- <b>Everything is just political posturing</b>, the debt ceiling will be raised and all will continue normally. Since 1976 there have been seventeen shut-downs where the federal government can not carry out new spending. In 1995-96 the shut-down in the administration Clinton lasted 21 days. The Obama administration reached the debt ceiling in May 2013 following an unprecedented increase in spending from February to July. Give a cheque to the government and it will spends it, and more. In this occasion it has managed to keep within the 'limit' with "extraordinary measures", but on October 17th the limit simply is unavoidable. This time it will not be easy for Republicans to accept another deal that will probably lead to another fiscal cliff in May-June 2014.<br /><br />- <b>It is an unjustified attack from Republicans. </b>The Obama administration wants to spend $1.1 trillion in "discretionary" spending in 2014. Discretionary. The maximum allowed currently is just ten percent lower. Therefore, it is not a monstrous disaster that leaves families in the streets and the state without resources. It is simply a matter of budgetary restraint and to delay a social security plan, Obamacare , that is generating more doubt and concerns about the cost of its implementation than the existing Medicare system.<br /><br />- <b>The cost of a 'government shut-down' is irrelevant.</b> The 1995-1996 one is estimated at about 2 billion dollars of today. In 2014 it could mean 35 billion.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DbK2FFesVis/UkfweOsOIII/AAAAAAAABOQ/GT_TYzomlTg/s1600/debt+ceiling.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="232" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DbK2FFesVis/UkfweOsOIII/AAAAAAAABOQ/GT_TYzomlTg/s320/debt+ceiling.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />The debt ceiling problem in the United States will not be the same now that interest rates are rising, the Fed has had to revise down their growth estimate for the economy and the risk of a new fiscal cliff in a few months looms again. <b>Even if yields are low and demand is strong, a deficit of close to 800 billion and a debt of 101% of GDP do not improve with the economy growing just 2 to 2.2%.</b> The U.S. must tackle immediately its spending spiral .<br /><br /><b>All debt ceiling increases in the past have been accompanied by more and more deficit spending. </b>Kicking the can forward has worked as interest rates fell. Now, the risk of ignoring the accumulation of debt and keep spending is too high, as is the case in the UK or Japan, the other kings of the money printing press. &nbsp;Because there is only one way for interest rates to go. Up. The perverse incentive of "debt does not matter", matters in the end. A lot.</div>

Massive debt accumulation generates greater fragility in the financial system. While global PMIs maintain their expansionary phase, we start to feel a certain level of deceleration. Fitch reduced its global growth estimates for both 2013-to +2.3% - and 2014-from +3.1% to +2.9% -, and the more cyclical companies that have posted results are cautious about the outlook for 2014. We should note that some economies are moving dangerously towards stagnation. Brazil , damaged by the populist policies of Rousseff , with soaring inflation, is poised to post virtually no growth in 2015 and India, with a growing current account deficit and high inflation in food prices, is a concern that I have mentioned before in this column.<br /><br />However, in between investor euphoria, the liquidity trap of monetary stimulus created by the eternal QE and imbalances in emerging countries, we had forgotten China. It is worth analysing some data.<br /><br />China continues to grow in a planned and optically spectacular way (9.1% annualized in the third quarter compared with the same period of 2012). The machine is doing 'okay' as long as the Government keeps it well oiled. It is the triumph of massive debt and central planning. Triumph? No, it is not . Even prime minister Li Keqiang, according to Reuters, referred to Chinese GDP as "man-made and for reference only ".<br /><br />A model of high debt and central planning that Spain implemented with disastrous results in the decade of "debt does not matter". &nbsp;<div><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0c-Z4aOly1U/Um5AEUCR_GI/AAAAAAAABRc/NzoLEt36dos/s1600/China+1.png"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0c-Z4aOly1U/Um5AEUCR_GI/AAAAAAAABRc/NzoLEt36dos/s320/China+1.png" /></a><br /><br />The Shibor (the Chinese interbank rate, similar to LIBOR) soared again last week, as it did in June. The interest rates in an excessively leveraged economy move back up again, despite past interventions of the People's Bank of China, putting at risk an economic system where the amount of non-performing loans and the true amount of provinces' debt are unknown.<br /><br />- Indeed, the Chinese provincial debt is not really known . Analysts' estimates move between $2.5 trillion and $5 trillion, between 30% and 60% of GDP. In the United States, for instance, it's less than 18%. This lack of transparency and information also shows how little control the central government has over <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/top10/2013-08/13/content_29703909.htm">the regions' debt</a>. Maybe that's why it has approved the creation of regional bad banks, to try to reduce systemic risk.<br /><br />- The private credit bubble, according to Credit Suisse , is above 178% of GDP, 26% above the acceptable maximum. Total debt reached 200% of GDP. Remember Spain in 2007? It was close to 300%. And the level of spending-investment- is 12% higher than Japan at the height of its stimulus policy. Investment to GDP exceeds 48%, almost 10% more than the countries that industrialized more rapidly in the twentieth century. Of course, many people justify this level of investment by the need to modernize the country. However, in infrastructure, China suffers from overecapacity in many areas. It has the same highway density as the UK or the U.S..<br /><br />- All this credit bubble would not be a problem if Chinese companies were making fabulous profits and margins were spectacular, which would make the debt easily payable. However, 48% of the Hang Seng Index (comprising the largest Chinese companies) generated returns below cost of capital in 2012 and almost 30% did not cover financial costs with free cash flow. Does that sound familiar to those who heard "debt does not matter because most is non-recourse" in peripheral Europe in 2007?. Net margins of Chinese companies are the lowest (2.5%) of all emerging countries (average 6%).<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fRYmHK1NxEY/Um5AIShtdDI/AAAAAAAABRk/u3yPlOpIwK4/s1600/China+2.png"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fRYmHK1NxEY/Um5AIShtdDI/AAAAAAAABRk/u3yPlOpIwK4/s320/China+2.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />- A real estate bubble uncomfortably similar to the Irish or Spanish. Real estate investment is 18.7% of GDP compared with Spain at the height of our bubble (22%) and Ireland (20%). The ghost towns that populate the Chinese geography are well known, but when growth has started to slow down, new housing construction has soared by again to keep the "growth by central mandate" plan, surpassing sales by 20%.<br /><br />- Aggressive borrowing process. Today China takes up to four times more debt than in 2010 to create one unit of GDP.<br /><br />So what's the problem? The arguments supporting or justifying the Chinese Model are: "You're a scaremonger, this has been the case since 2000." "While there is credit available and the government decides it, China will grow as much as needed, there is no problem." "As long as the non-performing loan risk is concentrated in its banks, there is no contagion to the rest of the world." "There is no bubble, only a moderation of growth." "As long as China grows above 5%, the rest of the world is fine."<br /><br />Surprise, it's the same we heard in 2007-2008 in Ireland or Spain. However, China has huge implications for global credit markets -as it's the second-largest buyer of U.S. treasury bonds-, and for the anaemic industrial recovery process on which Japan depends heavily to improve its exports.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Efk3FK5tEb8/Um5AM92AalI/AAAAAAAABRs/-WAqJrLCp_o/s1600/China+3.png"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Efk3FK5tEb8/Um5AM92AalI/AAAAAAAABRs/-WAqJrLCp_o/s320/China+3.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />These data, as Goldman Sachs ,UBS and Credit Suisse point out in its excellent report "China: Curb Your Enthusiasm", show an uncomfortable reality. The Chinese government is faced with two alternatives: to grow artificially leading to a financial crisis of unpredictable effects, or clean its banks of systemic risk, which unquestionably means to limit credit expansion, and thus stopping its growth-through-debt model.<br /><br />Non-performing loans in China now exceed $88 billion. A figure that seems surprisingly low, as it is "officially" only 1% of total loans, compared with 9% in peripheral Europe or 12% in Spain, but the ratio is disguised by the huge amount of new loans, and the methodology to account as non-performing. But everyone, including the central government recognizes that the magnitude of the problem is worrying .<br /><br />An entrepreneur friend of mine, when asked if he was considering expanding to China said, "China is like the lottery, you can win, but most pay more than they receive." How long can the China bubble last? Years, or months. But today it's not a matter of 'scaremongering' or unwarranted concerns. The combination of low margins, massive debt and economic multipliers plummeting alarmingly always ends up badly. How badly it will end depends on the decision of the Chinese government. Moderate the madness or head towards a financial crisis.</div></div>

Brent has stayed strong this week on the drying up of Libyan exports. No such supply issues in the US where crude stocks have risen well above the 5-yr range causing the Brent-WTI spread to widen abruptly.<br /><br />EIA this week: Crude stocks +4.09 mboe vs. +2 mboe expected. Gasoline stocks -1.71 mboe vs. +0.03 mboe expected. Demand 20.14 Mboepd, year-on-year +9.9% . US Crude oil production up +1,184 kboepd year-on-year. Peak what?.<br /><br />Coal slump continues, now at $82.00/mt, losing all its October gains as ample increase of exports from Australia and South Africa meet high inventory levels all over Europe and milder weather. We would not see switch from gas to coal at a meaningful level until coal reaches $81/mt according to Morgan Stanley.<br /><br />US gas continues to slide at $3.64/mmbtu. Weekly storage rose 38bcf, well below the 5-yr average of a 57bcf injection. Inventories are now 3,779 Bcf, narrowing the surplus versus the 5-yr average to 57bcf. Last week’s weather was 34% cooler than the 5-year average. Over the last month, the weather-adjusted Supply/Demand balance has been 0.4bcf/d oversupplied versus the 5-yr average.<br /><br />A drop below $3.50/mmbtu would prompt increased consumption in the power generation sector. Gas-fired generation becomes increasingly competitive with coal-fired power plants as gas prices drop, and as much as 1.5-2 Bcf/d of natural gas consumption can be lost and gained in the power generation sector as prices swing in the $3.25 to $4.25 /mmbtu range (according to UBS).<br /><br />UK gas is the only rock star commodity... Back at 69.70p/therm, above the resistance level of 69.50/th seen all month. Daily demand increased to 193 mcm from average month daily demand figure of 175 mcm. Despite acceptable storage levels, 4,600 mcm, prices have shot with demand increase.<br /><br />CO2 continues to collapse at €4.63/mt despite on-going talks and meetings expected in November at EU level to discuss strict measures to curb EUA oversupply. The debate in Brussels has already moved on from backloading to structural reform proposals, which could eventually lead to tightened system. Commission officials are increasingly sold on the idea of a flexible reserve mechanism, aimed at making the ETS a more responsive system so that a large over or under supply could not build up in future. Officials seem convinced that such reform should take effect in Phase III (2013-2020) though nothing will likely be agreed before 2015 and how this could work in practice is unclear. Don't bet on the EU to make a big change, and CO2 price reflects it. <br /><br />Power prices in Germany fall (again) to 37.35/MWh and Nordpool to €38/MWh. No real bullish argument either from weather or industrial demand anywhere in Europe except the UK where reserve margins remain tight (clean dark spreads at £26.5/MWh vs £24/MWh in September).<br /><br />In Southern Europe, demand continues to be weak. Power demand in Spain in October was down another 1.2% weather adjusted, with gas demand down 10.6%.</div>

The United Kingdom, throughout the Gordon Brown years, was the Keynesian stimulus experiment that the advocates inflation and devaluation always 'forget'. They talk a lot about Abenomics and Obama but forget the stimulus+inflation-led economic destruction of the early 2000s, and the hole in public finances it caused. A hole that the UK has not been able to dig itself out of, despite carrying out a brutal monetary stimulus policy where the Bank of England buys nearly 70% of the public debt issued.<br /><br />However, to the surprise of many experts, the United Kingdom appears to be starting to recover quickly. It is estimated that the economy grew by 1.5% in the first nine months, with a marked acceleration from quarter to quarter, to 3.2% annualized, and that will continue to advance by 3% in 2014.&nbsp;Given that in 2012 the economy grew by only 0.2%, the results are spectacular to say the least, especially considering that other members of the 'Money Printing Club' - Japan and the United States - continue to disappoint with very questionable macroeconomic results, from a massive trade deficit and debt in Japan, to lacklustre growth and weak labour market, according to the Federal Reserve itself, in the U.S..<br /><br />What is the miracle of the British economy? Probably a housing bubble of dangerous proportions, already warned by newspapers as ideologically diverse as the Daily Telegraph , The Guardian and City Am (" Subprime Britain", read an article).<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HqV8Ds2Lp7M/UndtICQVDZI/AAAAAAAABUc/WnpNXe0-OUA/s1600/UK+1.png"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HqV8Ds2Lp7M/UndtICQVDZI/AAAAAAAABUc/WnpNXe0-OUA/s320/UK+1.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />There are unquestionable positive elements:<br /><br />- The UK now exports more outside the European Union (52%) than inside, being less exposed to the crisis in the Eurozone. Having reached a record high in June 2013, and growing at 3% annually, exports are about 32% of GDP.<br /><br />- Car sales have soared and have almost returned to pre-crisis levels, while in the European Union these remain at depressed levels. The exchange rate pound-euro favours European car sales in the UK.<br /><br />- After the recent tax cuts and support for small and medium enterprises, the level of unemployment reached its lowest levels since 2009, 7.7%, despite increased immigration. In addition, consumption began to grow, with data from Coffer Peach showing sales increases in restaurants (+1.9% in August) and hotels (+4% in the first half of the year).<br /><br />- Government deficit starts to decrease significantly. Cutting taxes, attracting capital and laying the red carpet for entrepreneurs works. And has generated record tax revenues ("tax receipts hit record high of £1bn per week more than Labour grabbed" read the Daily Telegraph). 25 billion pounds more in revenues, according to HMRC. See below the graph of the UK government deficit (-10% to -5.8%).<br /><div><br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-275QsKII--s/UndtPD0Pf5I/AAAAAAAABUk/0zmScFkZGD8/s1600/UK+2.png"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-275QsKII--s/UndtPD0Pf5I/AAAAAAAABUk/0zmScFkZGD8/s320/UK+2.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />- However, all this data is positive but not comparable to the impact of the Help to Buy policy, also known in the UK as the 'Viagra of the housing bubble'. The effects were very fast. Home prices have surpassed the 2008 peak, and they had already risen significantly with the entry of foreign money coming out of the EU looking for a safehaven against the risk of the euro break-up. This saw up to 80% of the houses sold in some areas going to Greek, Spanish, Portuguese or Italian investors in 2011-2012, according Foxton's. Companies like Grafton, a construction material supplier, have seen their sales in the UK rise by 5.5%. Cemex commented that sales in the country grew by 9% in the second quarter. The demand for housing, according to Crest Nicholson, was up 46% since the implementation of the Help To Buy.... And the average salary of construction workers rose 20% in the first half of 2013.<br /><br />See the index of house prices from Nationwide:<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6Ov0jO2bSSU/UndtUejRpzI/AAAAAAAABUs/iPQ75iwRgW0/s1600/UK+3.png"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6Ov0jO2bSSU/UndtUejRpzI/AAAAAAAABUs/iPQ75iwRgW0/s320/UK+3.png" /></a><br /><br /><br />Is this all positive? Demand grows, the economy grows, house prices recover, people see 'perceived wealth' increase, more furniture and curtains are sold...<br /><br />But there are several warning signs:<br /><br />- The guarantee of cheap money from the Government increases the risk of bad payments. There have been 210 billion pounds in aid available in the Funding for Lending  and Help To Buy programs, while the ratio of debt to income soared for first-time buyers from 3 to 1 to 4.4 to 1 (The Daily Telegraph).<br /><br />- Most home sales -over 50% - are made ??without mortgage and sold to foreign investors looking to rent. But there is a lot of leverage hidden in these "yield-seeking" operations. Sometimes up to 75%. Maybe not mortgages, but loads of corporate debt. And in some cases, rental yields are as low as 2-3% (in Central London, for example). At the same time, rents have increased much faster than wages for five consecutive years, leading to an increased risk of default or exclusion, where, even if there is housing availability, conditions for rental are simply unaffordable.<br /><br />- In London the housing bubble seems well supported by two factors: the City and the arrival of foreign millionaires of any country. As a friend of a real estate agency says, "there is always a country that is doing well, and those people go to London as a first option." This is why London has become the most expensive city in the world, surpassing Tokyo. But that 'bubble expansive wave' is dissipated as one moves out of the M-25 (the ring road around London), which creates the risk of 'bubble implosion' as we saw in 2008. Prices soar starting in London and the shock waves reach up North, and when the bubble implodes, it impacts down to the South.<br /><br />Of course, the Bank of England is "carefully monitoring the risk of the creation of a possible bubble." It does not see danger today because transactions and mortgages signed are well below the highs of 2008, and because a large part is sold without any type of mortgage (but a lot of corporate debt). But that is where the risk lies... When those funds that buy real estate thinking of high rental yields find that there is an excess of unsold homes, which is never recognized as you all remember, corporate debt defaults start to rise. At the same time, the possibility of selling those houses becomes difficult because wages don't increase and the capacity of the majority of population to acquire just gets worse ... That is when the market sees the hidden stock of homes.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The argument that the UK needs to build even more houses to cope with demand and help lower prices doesn't stack up. Building is a pro-cyclical business. And demand cannot rise eternally with wages and disposable income falling or stale.<br /><br />Perhaps this time the house price rise is more sustainable growth, as some argue, as it is less aggressive in debt. I would be cautious. This time we are substituting mortgage risk for corporate debt risk.<br /><br />Economic growth supported by a disproportionate increase in the price of houses and thinking that these can only go higher because "we need to build much more to meet future demand," explodes aggressively on almost all occasions. This time, moreover, the risk is in the balance sheet of the government that guarantees the Help To Buy, and therefore, if it goes wrong, you will pay it in tax hikes.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>We have to keep an eye on this risk. But above all, a message to countries that do not attract hedge fund managers, Russian millionaires or Rock stars: Please do not copy the formula.</div><div><br /></div></div>

A method of payment where states can not interfere in the money supply, and where investors can find a safe haven from the assault on the saver that is the increased financial repression imposed by governments and central banks. Sure, but <b>my doubts come when the haven is virtual</b>, and therefore always subject to hacker attacks. In addition, there's the <b>risk of a confiscatory reaction</b> from states if it reaches a 'dangerously high "implementation. 'Free' currencies tend to end up being abolished or confiscated.<br /><div><br />For now, Bitcoin is not a currency, it is an exchange network. Like a financial asset, a future or a derivative. Unlike legal tender currencies, no one is forced to accept it as a method of payment. It is not dissimilar to a barter coupon. You accept it as payment for goods and services just the same way as you use something &nbsp;that is perceived as valuable by both parties, buyer and seller, be it a watch, a car or Bitcoin. As such, its value ??comes from the generalized perception of scarcity, future demand, liquidity and quality as a means to exchanging it for another currency, goods or services in the future.<br /><br />As a 'storage of value' asset it has <b>some similarities with a gold ETF</b>, but it is massively more volatile... and virtual. Therefore it is subject to extreme changes of perception with a supply and potential demand that is difficult to estimate.<br /><br />However, it has <b>no real similarity with physical gold</b>, having no history of transactions in times of extreme crisis. Everyone knows that gold can be exchanged for goods and services in case of a global catastrophe. Nobody knows yet how you create virtual storage of value.<br /><br />To be a currency, Bitcoin must go a long way in implementation, and be accepted globally for large and meaningful commercial transactions. <br /><br /><b>Is Bitcoin a speculative bubble? A pyramid scheme, a Ponzi scheme?</b><br /><br />I finally received a good report with a detailed analysis approach ('Bitcoin, A First Assessment' by Bank of America Merrill Lynch ) that seeks to clarify the risks and opportunities of this virtual phenomenon.<br /><br />According to Merrill Lynch, assuming Bitcoin becomes a widespread means of payment for transfers and e-commerce, an approach to its valuation could be reached through the addition of:<br /><br />- The average capitalization of established means of payment such as Western Union, MoneyGram and Euronet, <b>c$4.5 billion</b>.<br /><br />- The expectation that Bitcoin could capture 10% of global e-commerce, and the U.S. investment bank estimates this at $<b>5 billion</b>.<br /><br />That is, around <b>$9.5 billion capitalization, ie, below the market level, </b>which stands above $13 billion.<br /><br />The first part of the valuation analysis seems appropriate in a conservative scenario, but some could say that Bitcoin, having the benefit of a restricted supply, should capitalize above Western Union.<br /><br />But it is the second part of the sum which is more complex to analyse. To reach $5 billion, Merrill Lynch assumes that Bitcoin would accumulate 10% of on-line residential sales in the U.S., and extrapolates it to the rest of the world. In the U.S. the total e-commerce market is $224 billion and the domestic sector (households) accounts for approximately $10 billion, of which 10% would potentially be absorbed by Bitcoin. If we assume that the U.S. is close to 20% of global GDP and a similar degree of penetration of both trade and on-line commerce of Bitcoin in the world, Merrill's analysts arrive at the figure of $5 billion capitalization. However, according to my own analysis, that number could be much higher if we include companies using Bitcoin aggressively. If we add companies with 10% implementation, this part could reach $50 billion capitalization, assuming other electronic payment penetration levels.<br /><br />Such an assessment would indicate that <b>Bitcoin is either nearly 30% above its fundamental value, or up to 420% undervalued</b>, depending on the penetration assumptions.<br /><br />That is the dilemma of analysing Bitcoin, to understand the ability to penetrate markets that today are huge and where a space can be generated for this method of payment without falling into the risks of:<br /><br />- Being a threat to states and their control over currency and the money supply. In a world where central banks and governments have made financial repression as a last resort to support excessive debt spending, the use of legislation to attack any means that threatens their main weapon of economic policy should not be underestimated. Bitcoin, even in the middle of the valuation range, would be far from becoming a 'problem' like that.<br /><br />- Confiscation of assets Roosevelt-style as we have seen in the past with gold, and other paradigms of government actions to steal the savings of investors in 'safe havens'. Being a virtual asset makes this very difficult, but not impossible.<br /><br />For Bitcoin to be a bubble, global electronic commerce estimates should be much lower than the current maximum capitalization, ie the perception of demand unachievable in a fairly conservative analysis. That risk is not there looking at sales trends of global on-line commerce.<br /><br />In addition, to be a bubble, Bitcoin should meet the requirement of having a rapid and increasing supply well above demand. Bitcoin supply is limited to 21 million by 2140.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p79r3ZHEcEE/UqWlLOf-wHI/AAAAAAAABfk/HuCin9X0T-0/s1600/bitcoin+2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p79r3ZHEcEE/UqWlLOf-wHI/AAAAAAAABfk/HuCin9X0T-0/s320/bitcoin+2.png" width="290" /></a></div><br />To be a Ponzi scheme it should meet the following criteria:<br /><br />- That profitability granted to existing holders of Bitcoin is 'guaranteed' and coming from the additional coins purchased by new investors, ie, to make the basis of 'new investors' only growing. That is not the case, the valuation of Bitcoin it fixed by demand and supply generated by a multitude of buyers and sellers, and sellers have no false guarantee or allegedly safe "return".<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TtL_zdTOuzg/UqWles_NU3I/AAAAAAAABfs/5sQibi9leyg/s1600/bitcoin+3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="183" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TtL_zdTOuzg/UqWles_NU3I/AAAAAAAABfs/5sQibi9leyg/s320/bitcoin+3.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />- That price dynamics is uniform, opaque, controlled by a single operator and providing a false sense of 'security', ie it only goes 'up' until new buyers stop falling in the pyramid scheme and it explodes. Bitcoin buyers are aware of the volatility and possibility of selling at a loss. Bitcoin has seen huge rises in price and massive &nbsp;falls, it behaves more like a financial start-up, an asset where price is being checked every day according to the potential supply and demand.<br /><br /><br />Therefore, it is not like a Ponzi scheme.<br /><br />Bitcoin, for valuation purposes, is equivalent to a tech startup or a junior explorer-miner. Its value only transpires when it begins to dispel doubts about its implementation as a combination of means of payment and safe haven.<br /><br />To achieve the potential and penetration needed to justify much higher prices, there are two things to look for:<br /><br />- The enormous volatility, with moves of 30-40% in one day, makes it difficult for large companies and massive consumers to accept it quickly. Volatility itself prevents its penetration into the mass market. To be a universally accepted means of payment it should have similar levels of volatility to those established currencies or gold. That's why I say it's still not a currency, but a volatile financial asset .<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eHTrYJQGFcs/UqWloGah3eI/AAAAAAAABf0/QaB60NbscVw/s1600/bitcoin+4.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="160" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eHTrYJQGFcs/UqWloGah3eI/AAAAAAAABf0/QaB60NbscVw/s320/bitcoin+4.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />- The length and quality of exchange. Bitcoin has a major advantage, supply is limited, and to avoid manipulation by a bank or state, there is no centralized validation system (clearing) that is why each transaction is analysed and delayed, to avoid double counting. Well, for large transactions this means a wait of up to fifty minutes until a payment is confirmed, which greatly limits the mass deployment in companies and trade. Furthermore, several of the servers have been 'hacked'. One such exchange, Bitcoinica lost 18,547 bitcoins after a cyber attack. BIPS in Europe lost 1,195 after a security issue. <br /><br />When transactions are immediate, safe and not subject to huge volatility, valuation of Bitcoin could start to make sense.<br /><br />There are still many doubts to clarify. If you find it difficult to understand the phenomenon, it is best to avoid it, not ride a wave dependent on variables with huge fluctuations.  I don't own any Bitcoin. I always thought that if something has a gazillion percent of upside potential, I may let the first massive rise to those that accept the risk that goes from 'experiment' to 'reality'.<br /><br />What I find interesting is that Bitcoin shows that more people are scared and looking for ways to get out of the vicious circle of financial repression and devaluation of currencies. The implementation of an 'intervention-free currency' or means of payment can only be positive. And, if Bitcoin or any other free currency ends up being widely used, it may restore sanity to those governments that engage in this race of currency destruction they want to sell us as 'social' and that in reality is just a massive transfer of wealth from savers to the indebted states. </div><div><br /></div></div>

Long-term estimates for Chinese coal demand, for the year 2035, range from 3.66 billion tons of coal equivalent, up from 2.29 billion tons in 2010, to as low as 1.51 billion tons, depending on Beijing's environmental policies.<br /><br /><b>IEA medium term coal market report:</b>&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>.

China is to account for 60% of new global demand, without reaching its peak within the next 5 years. <br />. India will rival China as the top importer in the next 5 years. <br />. Despite the slightly slower pace of growth, however, coal will meet more of the increase in global primary energy than oil or gas.<br /><br /><b>CO2</b> at €4.9/mt stays weak after the market discounted the EU backloading vote, which addresses little of the oversupply of EUAs. The EU Parliament voted through the approval for the backloading of 900m tn of CO2 permits. &nbsp;Backloading anyway doesn’t address the structural oversupply that exists in the ETS of more than 2b tn. Following that another vote is due by the EU Ministers next week (December 16th) and then the Environment Committee will have to go over the details with another vote at the EU Parliament for final approval due next year.

The larger the outlays are, the more actual savings are diverted from wealth generators - Frank Shostak</blockquote><br />The economic news of the week in Europe have reduced the euphoria about a possible recovery. France went into recession in the third quarter and general Eurozone data is weaker than expected.<br /><br />In my new book <a href="http://www.amazon.es/Viaje-libertad-econ%C3%B3mica-esclaviza-austeridad/dp/8423417395">Journey to Economic Freedom</a> &nbsp;(Deusto) I devoted a chapter to the mistakes in economic policies of many countries in the European Union, because they were copied from France. Stagnation, high taxation and lack of reforms. &nbsp;In order to maintain at all costs a hypertrophied state and bloated administrations, funds are spent on useless schemes at the expense of those &nbsp;who generate wealth.<br /><br />At the smallest hint of a recovery we see that countries, instead of continuing with reforms, decide to relax and fall back into recession.<br /><br />And now governments are worried about...deflation. Why? Let's see...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3vLKosjofmI/Up3l-jsyyDI/AAAAAAAABas/KZmxUaURt-o/s1600/deflation+2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="116" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3vLKosjofmI/Up3l-jsyyDI/AAAAAAAABas/KZmxUaURt-o/s320/deflation+2.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vjv9M7Dwauc/Up3l-nSvsII/AAAAAAAABaw/Izewded0gSA/s1600/deflation+1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="101" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vjv9M7Dwauc/Up3l-nSvsII/AAAAAAAABaw/Izewded0gSA/s320/deflation+1.png" width="320" /></a></div>Risk for peripherals<br /><br />The risk to the recovery of Spain and peripheral Europe could come from an impact on exports. Spain exported to the larger economies of Europe 50% of its goods. In the first half of 2013, an increase of 8% of exports in Spain, although sales to France fell 1.7% to Germany 0.6% and Italy 0.4%. Seems some peripherals depend less on the EU partners to export.<br /><br /><br />Foreign investment in Spain between January and June 2013 also shows an important differentiator component on the past. Foreign investment of residents (ie, Spaniards bringing outside money) is only 4.9% of the total, so 95.1% comes from foreign investors .<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kbEIc9R6M0I/Up3l-k2tIEI/AAAAAAAABa0/43Y2cZ2qSkE/s1600/deflation+3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="294" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kbEIc9R6M0I/Up3l-k2tIEI/AAAAAAAABa0/43Y2cZ2qSkE/s320/deflation+3.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />However, in the interviews I've had this week the question that was repeated again and again was that the greatest concern regarding the stagnation of the EU is the "risk of deflation."<br /><br />First we must clarify <b>that in most European countries and in Spain there is no deflation, there is disinflation due to badly managed industrial plans and overcapacity .</b><br /><br />When you have invested (spent) hundreds of billions of euros in "industrial plans" and productive capacity, especially in energy, car industry, textile, retail and infrastructure, what we are experiencing is a reduction of prices due to competition between oversized sectors, an overcapacity of up to 40% in some cases. On the other hand, inflation exists in other elements, very relevant to the industry and consumption, such as energy costs.<br /><br />The "alleged risk of deflation" is the excuse of governments to justify greater financial repression . Trying to create false inflation through rate cuts while citizens have less purchasing power, or through monetary stimulus plans when taxes rise leads nowhere. Look at Japan, 17 consecutive months of real wage reductions.<br /><br /><b>Prices fall because we built massive productive capacity for a demand that never arrived and because the disposable income of citizens has been destroyed by confiscatory taxation.</b><br /><br />To reactivate the economy governments should return money to the pockets of citizens who have stoically accepted and paid interventionist policies and supported schemes and incentives that have led the EU to spend up to 3% of GDP to destroy 4.5 million jobs and sink the economy.<br /><br />The economy is still not recovering in Europe, the transmission belt for monetary policy is broken, debt, both in relative and absolute terms, continues to grow, employment is not improving and now they tell us that we enter into deflation.<br /><br />First, credit to the private sector still has not improved because all available credit is crowded out by government debt, making the financial system more risky and therefore more fragile against any sovereign risk.<br /><br />Wages are still falling, and to think that forcing Germany to stimulate its domestic demand will have a ripple effect on the periphery is wrong empirically, as we mentioned in this column some months ago, where we showed that the multiplier effect of attracting foreign capital and direct financial investment is three times higher than internal domestic demand stimulus.<br /><br />This disinflation, the European Japanisation of which I already warned in 2012 is a dire consequence of interventionist policies, which lead to de-industrialization and demand collapse.<br /><br />Combating possible deflation risk with more interventionist policies while still curtailing the consumption capacity of citizens with higher taxes only leads us to enlarge the debt hole.<br /><br />In addition, the voices calling for monetary stimulus forget that the velocity of money, which measures economic activity, collapses, creating a transfer of money to financial assets, stocks and bonds, but the collapse of productive investment. According to Citigroup , the velocity of money in the United States &nbsp;and United Kingdom has fallen to levels of the mid-60s while nominal GDP is at 2001 levels. But the stock market is at historic highs and high risk bonds, at minimum yields. That is, we create 'wealth illusion' in financial risk assets while sustaining GDP artificially, but destroy wealth creation and employment .<br /><br />We have to stop the vicious circle of spending, debt, impoverishment, financial repression, less wealth, less investment, higher unemployment and more spending and pass into a virtuous cycle of saving, budgetary restraint, improved disposable income, consumption , investment and employment.<br /><br />Prosperity does not come from unicorn breeding, but consumption and productive investment.</div>

However, in the 70s he sporadically wrote gems like this evocative Christmas song, particularly coming from a person who has never lived outside of California. This song remained unpublished and only available on bootlegs for many years. For me one of Brian Wilson's masterpieces. We love you, Brian!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0BVypgYrxo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0BVypgYrxo</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Somewhere children outside, Screamin' down a daredevil slide, Rosy-cheeked bundles of cold-weather clothes."</blockquote><br /><b>2) "Do They Know It's Christmas" (Band Aid single )</b><br /><br />Bob Geldof ( Boomtown Rats ) and Midge Ure ( Ultravox ) composed one of the few Christmas songs that does not fall into empty clichés, and one of the catchiest choruses in pop history. Although the artists involved have done more damage to the ozone layer with their hairspray excess than the entire coal industry, this song is just perfect.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjQzJAKxTrE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjQzJAKxTrE</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas / The greatest gift they'll get this year is life."</blockquote><br /><b>3) "Merry Christmas (I Don't Want to Fight Tonight)" (The Ramones, single )</b><br /><br />The Ramones were not at their best artistic moment when they released this single, but they made ??a hymn to reconciliation and forgiveness, with a catchy melody that reminded us of their three first great and essential albums.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y5GtaTrPHM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y5GtaTrPHM</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"I loved you from the start/ 'cause Christmas is not the time for breaking each other's hearts."</blockquote><br /><b>4) "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" (John Lennon, single ) + "Once Upon A Long Ago" (Paul McCartney, All The Best! )</b><br /><br />The Beatles, together and separately, made ??several Christmas songs. Together, "Christmas Time Is Here Again", is not among their best. It is a simple and fun song, but nothing else. George Harrison made ??the terrible "Ding Dong Ding Dong" and Ringo Starr recorded several pop carols with mixed results ("I Wanna Be Santa Claus" being the best). But it was John Lennon with "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" the one that recorded the best Beatles' Christmas song. Paul McCartney made ??many, with Wings and solo (which comes to being the same thing). My favourite is not his biggest holiday hit "Wonderful Christmastime", but the darker and more pessimistic "Once Upon A Long Ago".<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8Vfp48laS8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8Vfp48laS8</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"So this is Xmas, And what have you done, Another year over and a new one just begun."</blockquote><div><br /></div><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBsSUptatMw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBsSUptatMw</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Playing guitars on an empty stage, counting the bars of an iron cage, Tell me darling, what can it mean? Once upon a long ago, children searched for treasure."</blockquote><div><b>5) 'Winter Wonderland "(Darlene Love, Phil Spector's "A Christmas Gift For You")</b></div><br />Phil Spector's "A Christmas Gift For You" is the best pop Christmas album in history, no doubt for me. A genius at the top of his game. He might have been a tyrant and a murderer, but he was an amazing producer and composer. As any good dictator, he gathered in a single album all the bands and artists he worked with, and note after note, instrument after instrument, created an album that is still as exciting today as it must have been in its day. A friend gave it to me as a present and I thought "how tacky, an album of Christmas carols by 60s pop stars". How wrong I was. I appreciate it now as one of the best musical gifts ever.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAC3jp8Z5c4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAC3jp8Z5c4</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"In the meadow we can build a snowman / Then pretend that he is Parson Brown / He'll say, "Are you married?" we'll say "No man, But you can do the job when you're in town!".</blockquote><br /><b>6) "Mistress for Christmas" (AC/DC "Razor's Edge")</b><br /><br />If you don't like AC/DC you will hate this song. Loud. Sexist. Politically incorrect. But if you do not like AC/DC you are the enemy, LOL. This song was recorded during their weakest artistic period, but concentrates all the best of the group. A killer riff murderer, a rowdy and politically incorrect lyric and a thundering beat.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mOBUUhsRwc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mOBUUhsRwc</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"I like female form in minimum dress, Money to spend with a capital "S", Get a date with the woman in red"</blockquote><br /><b>7) "Santa's Got An Airplane" (Beach Boys "Christmas Album, Christmas '77 and extended edition")</b><br /><br />When Brian Wilson, composer of all their hits, fell into depression and mental illness, the Beach Boys disappeared from the music world as a relevant act. During the mid 70's, Mike Love came up with the bright idea of recycling part of their flop disastrous albums, Landlocked, which was rejected by the record company, and MIU, best forgotten as it contains the worst songs in the band's history, and change the lyrics to Christmas songs. Unfortunately this 1977 Christmas album was also rejected and was not published until many years later. From this record you can save this wonderful song, combining crazy hippy messages, drug references and nods to Christmas. Essential.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aHGvdamu1I">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aHGvdamu1I</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"He skydives down to the chimney with Ease / Parachutes a package to the whole family / It's Santa's Air Special delivery to under your tree."</blockquote><br /><b>8) "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" (Bruce Springsteen, live single 1978)</b><br /><br />How great is the Boss?. Taken from one of his concerts in 1978, when the E Street Band was in the prime of its strengths, this fun version of the classic Christmas song concentrates in a few minutes all the reasons why Springsteen and his group were the best live experience in Rock&nbsp;between 1975 and 1985. May Clarence Clemons and Danny&nbsp;Federici rest in peace, they made ??us happy for decades. Today the band is still excellent, but these memories...<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rebS3FABeck">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rebS3FABeck</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"He sees you when you're sleeping / He knows when you're awake / He knows if you've been bad or good, So be good for goodness sake".</blockquote><br /><b>9) 'Father Christmas' (The Kinks, single )</b><br /><br />It is curious that this list of great Christmas songs includes many tracks created during periods of low creativity and slump in popular success for some of the bands. The holiday muse seems to appear when the gold records become plywood ones. This song is another example. The Kinks were in a period of popularity downturn but their albums and lyrics were still wonderful. Ray Davies delivers one of his best and most cynical lyrics, removing the clichés of syrupy Christmas spirit.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-oVPVsCqs4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-oVPVsCqs4</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Father Christmas, give us some money / Don't mess around with those silly toys / We'll beat you up if you do not hand it over / We want your bread so do not make us annoyed / Give all the toys to the little rich boys ".</blockquote><br /><b>10) "Christmas" (The Who's "Tommy")</b><br /><br />Pete Townshend wrote the first successful rock opera (not the first chronologically, the Pretty Things own that honour) and within it we can find this little song about Christmas for the deaf and mute boy, Tommy, as sung by his family.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDriHKfb6x8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDriHKfb6x8</a><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.

John Paul Getty</blockquote><br />Fans of monetary stimulus always ignore the biggest and best push for the economy. Cheap energy. Finding oil and gas.<br /><br />The United States have achieved an economic stimulus equivalent to 1.3% of GDP thanks to the energy revolution brought by fracking. It is a very significant positive effect, both on the supply and demand side.<br /><br />- On the supply side, it has led the U.S. to be energy independent in gas and in oil very shortly. In October 2013, domestic crude oil production exceeded imports for the first time since 1995 (7.74 million barrels a day compared with imports of 7.57 million barrels per day). In fact, imports of crude oil in North America have dropped to the lowest level of the past 17 ??years.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E9rlJ3YySFg/Up39jzAT43I/AAAAAAAABbk/LzR19CoFYb0/s1600/Excess+Oil.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="157" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E9rlJ3YySFg/Up39jzAT43I/AAAAAAAABbk/LzR19CoFYb0/s320/Excess+Oil.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />- On the demand side, although the economy is growing and industrial production increases, technological efficiency is improving consumption very significantly consumption. In 2008, the United States spent 10% of gross domestic product in energy. In 2013, it will not reach 8.5%.<br /><br />At the close of this article, the spread between U.S. benchmark oil (West Texas Intermediate) and the European benchmark (Brent) stood at nearly $15/bbl. The lack of infrastructure does not allow to evacuate and export the surplus from the U.S. to the world, and that isolates the U.S. and Canada price as separate and autonomous market dynamics.<br /><br />The spread between West Texas Intermediate and Brent is likely to remain at $15/bbl. The lack of infrastructure does not allow evacuating and exporting the surplus from the U.S. to the world, and the Keystone filling is not enough to offset the rise of production.<br /><br />Total product demand in the US on a trailing four week basis is 20.1m b/d, +5.6% y/y. Gasoline demand is up 3.3%, distillate demand growth + 0.1% and jet fuel demand is up 8.1%.<br /><br />At 386mb crude stocks are well above the upper limit of the average range for December. Gasoline inventories are in the upper half of the average range. Distillate stocks are below the lower limit of the average range for this time of year. <br /><div><br /></div>The price of gas in U.S. is $ 3.9/ mmbtu compared to the European average of $ 8.5 / mmbtu. More than twice. Meanwhile, in Japan, energy costs have skyrocketed in 2013 and the price at which the country imports liquefied natural gas exceeds $ 15/mmbtu ... five times more expensive than the U.S. gas.<br /><br />Not only the U.S. imports less, but the cost is lower than that of its competitors in the OECD countries. It is the way to energy independence in the U.S. I already commented in 2012 here.<br /><br />The effect produced by this energy revolution is twofold:<br /><br />- It greatly reduces the "geopolitical premium" to be added to the price of crude . Even though Brent reflects an obvious geopolitical risk, it is much smaller than in the past because the balance between supply and demand is very well covered. That the price of Brent is "only" $110 a barrel in an environment of decent demand growth and supply problems in Libya, Syria, Iraq and Iran is a clear proof of how well the market is supplied .<br /><br />Brent price dynamics is lateral, despite supply problems in Libya due to internal protests, which led the country to export less than 90,000 barrels per day (compared to the country's capacity of 1.25 million barrels per day), sanctions to Iran (which led the country to export about 1 million barrels a day, compared with its capacity of 2.5 million) and the political difficulties to boost production in Iraq after the war.&nbsp;In fact, Iraq is likely to slash its production guidance by 35%. Meanwhile, Iran is aiming at adding 500kbpd to supply, but technical challenges remain, more important than sanction lifting. At the OPEC meeting, Iran stated that it was ready to open its doors to the oil majors from Europe and the US, but the seven companies named by Iran to boost oil output are unanimously sceptical about the growth targets set by the country (BP, RDS, Total, ENI, Statoil, Exxon and Conoco).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W_xSM_hxMC8/Up39i9rIheI/AAAAAAAABbY/nyjopag8Dqg/s1600/Excess+Oil+2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="259" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W_xSM_hxMC8/Up39i9rIheI/AAAAAAAABbY/nyjopag8Dqg/s320/Excess+Oil+2.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Not only the spare capacity of OPEC countries is adequate to address specific risks, but the oil price still includes a negative impact of production incidents - unexpected cuts to supply from military or political crises - of 2.7 million barrels a day. If those unexpected cuts are normalized, the geopolitical premium in oil prices will fall further .<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AoHat1S49Wk/Up39ljNV-XI/AAAAAAAABcA/yVdptkF5yig/s1600/Excess+Oil+3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="280" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AoHat1S49Wk/Up39ljNV-XI/AAAAAAAABcA/yVdptkF5yig/s320/Excess+Oil+3.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">OPEC held its meeting for the half year and, unsurprisingly, maintained its production quota of 30 mbpd.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">The return to normal production in Libya could add 1m bpd, but the future rise in production in Iraq is under threat, and I see it impossible to take the country's production from 3mbpd to 4mbpd in 2014 or mid-2015. A possible lifting of the embargo on Iran might enable the country to produce and export an additional 500kbpd.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;">As such, it is virtually impossible that, even with Libya and Iran returning, OPEC production would reach 33 mb/d. Therefore the call on OPEC stays at 29-30 mbpd in 2014. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Emirates are expected to balance the market cutting part of the production that they increased to offset the Iran embargo. It requires a maximum cut of 1.1mbpd to tighten the market aggressively.</div><div><br /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W_xSM_hxMC8/Up39i9rIheI/AAAAAAAABbY/nyjopag8Dqg/s1600/Excess+Oil+2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="259" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W_xSM_hxMC8/Up39i9rIheI/AAAAAAAABbY/nyjopag8Dqg/s320/Excess+Oil+2.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />There is enough spare capacity and the incremental production comes from so-called "safe" countries, the U.S. in particular. Of the newly added production capacity in the oil value chain -1.3 million barrels per day in 2013 and 1.7 million in 2014- most comes from North America (including Canada), at a low cost and with an EROEI higher than 8x, ie, competitive and sustainable. This creates greater stability and less risk.<br /><br /><br />It is an environment where price is acceptable for producers and consumers, where the "oil burden" in the OECD -cost of foreign-imported oil- does not reach 6.5% of gross domestic product. The possibility of excess supply in the next three years is not small. There is plenty of oil and the extra barrels that arrive to the system come from countries with lower political difficulties.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Yj2jNuxr7vc/Up39iztnNAI/AAAAAAAABbc/ixuhEvvKZCE/s1600/Excess+Oil+5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Yj2jNuxr7vc/Up39iztnNAI/AAAAAAAABbc/ixuhEvvKZCE/s320/Excess+Oil+5.jpg" width="309" /></a></div><br />The EIA (Energy Information Administration) announced that in the second quarter of 2013 global oil production exceeded demand. Although this dynamic might change, as many analysts expect, it will not get to 55% of the average difference between consumption and production of the last five years.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pZd1vOCs3Ls/Up39jTGQ-hI/AAAAAAAABbg/B63ftyCCRW4/s1600/Excess+Oil+6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="188" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pZd1vOCs3Ls/Up39jTGQ-hI/AAAAAAAABbg/B63ftyCCRW4/s320/Excess+Oil+6.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />In my opinion, the supply of crude oil and liquids will probably exceed demand growth estimates -1.1 million barrels per day in 2013 and 1.2 in 2014 -. Why? Because this increase depends critically on China to continue to grow in a way that many consider questionable, as I explained in my article "Careful with China", and the "efficiency" effect is already part of the policy of the Chinese Communist Party itself. Crude imports from China fell by 13.8% in 2013 (4.8 million barrels/day to October).<br /><br />What does this mean?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-evtutPFWe-w/Up39jp4MMjI/AAAAAAAABbw/1dXjIN_hi3Q/s1600/Excess+Oil+7.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="221" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-evtutPFWe-w/Up39jp4MMjI/AAAAAAAABbw/1dXjIN_hi3Q/s320/Excess+Oil+7.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>The incremental oil demand comes mostly from emerging countries which , as we all know, tend to suffer abrupt periods of expansion and decline. In fact, my estimates of demand growth indicate an extremely modest increase, which would lead to oil prices evolving with little more than inflation.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HT1PTbrC1i8/Up39k54rCwI/AAAAAAAABb4/vETVX4KsDfA/s1600/Excess+oil+4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HT1PTbrC1i8/Up39k54rCwI/AAAAAAAABb4/vETVX4KsDfA/s320/Excess+oil+4.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />That the OECD is facing a mid-term future where oil-price shocks are becoming less frequent and have less impact, as the effect of new technologies -renewables- and efficiency take hold.<br /><br />The surprise may be that in 2014 crude prices continue losing that "geopolitical premium" while the US energy revolution continues. A "real stimulus" for OECD countries. Yes, I know, the naysayers will say that oil is running out, that liquids do not count, that all is a lie, that demand will always grow as if technology and efficiency were inexistent, but the reality is different.<br /><br />The last barrel of oil will not cost millions of dollars. It will be worth zero. Because by then, if the threats of depletion were remotely true-and they are not- oil would have been replaced as major source of energy.<br /><br />Never bet against human ingenuity. Even the most optimistic would have never estimated the success of the energy revolution that has occurred in the U.S..<br /><br />The oil market is well supplied and the impact of shocks is falling. I am sorry for the naysayers, doom-forecasters, we are going to have plenty of oil for many, many decades.<br /><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">For companies, dividends are under threat:<o:p></o:p></span></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB"><br /></span></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Over the last 4 quarters, Europe’s five oil majors have generated negative Free Cash Flow of -$1.5bn and declared dividends of $35bn.

Nevertheless, it sold several million copies. The mirage of our days may be the expectation of 2.9% growth in the United States in 2014. And it also sells a lot.<br /><br />The US is growing. All is well. Unemployment is low. Expansionary policy works. Does it? Not only it is not, but the most important economists of the Federal Reserve are warning about it.<br /><br />Look at yesterday's GDP by categories: The "headline"&nbsp;+3.6% growth hides a meagre&nbsp;+1.9% ex-inventories. Q3 Consumer Spending +1.4%, was the weakest since December 2009. Business Inventory added 1.7% to +3.6% GDP, the most since 2011. In fact,&nbsp;<b>real final sales (core GDP, ex-inventories) was actually revised down to just 1.9%.</b> (Graph from Business Insider)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mDKXDkZIFM0/UqGb1S1eEbI/AAAAAAAABc8/ITxXaH__iyE/s1600/US+MIRAGE+6.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mDKXDkZIFM0/UqGb1S1eEbI/AAAAAAAABc8/ITxXaH__iyE/s320/US+MIRAGE+6.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />The Federal Reserve acknowledged in its last meeting that the macroeconomic data is still disappointing, with weak growth and poor employment. This graph shows it, but the stock market is rising and house prices are rocketing... "Perception of wealth" they call it. Sure, for those who already own stocks or property. Meanwhile more than 65% of property sales are made without mortgage...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Tsu7zyWC2V8/UqGdU6Oj7KI/AAAAAAAABdI/_tiHKJ4zo7k/s1600/US+MIRAGE+1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="190" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Tsu7zyWC2V8/UqGdU6Oj7KI/AAAAAAAABdI/_tiHKJ4zo7k/s320/US+MIRAGE+1.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />The perverse incentive to flood markets with easy money generates a massively leveraged economy (check margin debt, at record highs), moves capital to the financial sector and sinks productive investment. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is becoming more like a soufflé , filled with air . Not only companies spend less, but the money is used to buy back stock, pay dividends and exchange capital in mergers and acquisitions, and not for added productive investment.<br /><br />Between 1996 and 2006 the largest companies in the U.S. (S &amp; P 500) invested about one trillion dollars per year, of which 70% was devoted to capex and R&amp;D while 30% to buyback and dividends. Since 2009 the annual number of total invested capital has soared to over $2.3 trillion, but 45% is used to buy back shares and pay dividends. In fact, neither the figure of productive investment or R&amp;D have increased substantially, inflation-adjusted, since 1998. That is, the 'free' money from the expansionary policy is used &nbsp;for protection, reducing the number of outstanding shares, merge and return cash to shareholders, not to expand organically &nbsp;(data from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley).<br /><br />The U.S. has created nearly half of all the money supply of its history in the past five years, and has lived the longest period ever seen without raising interest rates, and yet the labour participation rate (percentage of civil population of the United States with over 16 years of age or more who have a job or are actively looking for one) has fallen to 1978 levels, 62.8%. Some explain this due to "the demographic effect". However, adjusting for these demographic changes -there are fewer young workers and the older ones are living longer-, the labour force participation and employment has not improved since 2010 while the country engaged in money printing like crazy. Improving unemployment by 'taking people off the lists', as in Europe in the early 90s. Meanwhile, almost half of the working population in the U.S. earns less than $40,000 per annum.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ASW4z68--I0/UqHrOrUoAwI/AAAAAAAABeE/r28A8lYuvB4/s1600/US+mirage+7.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="232" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ASW4z68--I0/UqHrOrUoAwI/AAAAAAAABeE/r28A8lYuvB4/s320/US+mirage+7.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />From Michael Purves: "Payrolls this week report came in with an impressive 203k gain and a 7.0% unemployment print. More importantly the jobs additions drew from a wide variety of sectors, including manufacturing, and not the lower wage and more temporary job additions we have seen in earlier reports. <br /><br />The underemployment rate (U-6) also fell from 13.8% to 13.2%, representing the sharpest percentage drop &nbsp;since 2008. &nbsp; The most significant aspect of this report is not the numbers per se, but that the numbers were achieved in the context of notably higher interest rates. &nbsp;However, there are still notable signs of &nbsp;weakness: the participation rate (despite an uptick this morning) is still in a down trend, and we are still not seeing a significant improvement in average hourly earnings, or average weekly hours".<br /><br />Additionally, personal income decreased 0.1% and disposable personal income (DPI) decreased 0.2% in October.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gevcAogSzlA/UqHs7SISqxI/AAAAAAAABeQ/Dghjwkt_Ti0/s1600/US+MIRAGE+8.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="166" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gevcAogSzlA/UqHs7SISqxI/AAAAAAAABeQ/Dghjwkt_Ti0/s320/US+MIRAGE+8.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Monetary policy is proving to be a key driver of massive inequality, and benefiting only those that held assets or have access to massive debt.<br /><br />The greatest swindle since the miracle medicine men of the Wild West is to say that monetary policy is redistributive and social. But do not worry, they say, "next year, it will be better", "Just wait." Look at the Hiring Plans Index since 2011 (graphs from MS).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RH_bNq6zd_w/UqGki1vLFzI/AAAAAAAABdY/yWiJidaPf8U/s1600/US+MIRAGE+2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="224" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RH_bNq6zd_w/UqGki1vLFzI/AAAAAAAABdY/yWiJidaPf8U/s320/US+MIRAGE+2.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />The balance of the U.S. Federal Reserve is rapidly approaching a staggering $4 trillion dollars, buying about a billion a year in bonds, yet the economy is growing well below its potential ... but also that potential is deteriorating .<br /><br />QE does not create jobs exhibit 1:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ncVcw1MLqQc/UqnZRA2uohI/AAAAAAAABg4/NTVndVLCugQ/s1600/QE+Jobs+2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="191" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ncVcw1MLqQc/UqnZRA2uohI/AAAAAAAABg4/NTVndVLCugQ/s320/QE+Jobs+2.png" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Exhibit 2: Federal Reserve Balance Sheet Expansion vs Job Creation</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IRCDAc-jRRo/UqnZceDuaSI/AAAAAAAABhA/G_Px3A0RM14/s1600/QE+Jobs+.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="229" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IRCDAc-jRRo/UqnZceDuaSI/AAAAAAAABhA/G_Px3A0RM14/s320/QE+Jobs+.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />In the last two weeks I've read two excellent reports from Federal reserve economists William English and David Wilcox warning about the deterioration of the actual and potential growth of the United States. The &nbsp;graph of one of these reports shows how the correlation between potential and real GDP has broken, well below the trend from 2000 to 2007.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BoRFFOs61XI/UqGk2KUEEcI/AAAAAAAABdg/hNw2DhJ7uzQ/s1600/US+MIRAGE+3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="260" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BoRFFOs61XI/UqGk2KUEEcI/AAAAAAAABdg/hNw2DhJ7uzQ/s320/US+MIRAGE+3.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Companies do not invest in productive activities and job creation because conditions for confidence are simply not there. Artificially low rates and printing money may deceive a few analysts, but not presidents and CEOs of companies that have been able to be leaders and global competitors despite any government interference.<br /><br />Tax increases and financial repression destroy consumption, money velocity and job creation in the medium term.<br /><br />Goldman Sachs estimates that in 2014 capex and productive investment will grow by 9%. Analysing estimates and guidance for 2014 of most S&amp;P 500 companies, I doubt it. At best, it will be flat year-on-year.<br /><br />Government cannot replace private sector capex. Despite the low government bond yields and eternal lift of the debt ceiling, the U.S. continues to generate a massive deficit, projected at around $744 billion for Fiscal Year 2014. To 'fill' the loss of productive investment, assuming -which is a lot- that governments would spend wisely- the deficit would have to shoot another half a trillion dollars, and with it comes higher tax increases, more financial repression and... less productive investment.<br /><br />True, banks are stronger and have less risk and government is borrowing at low rates. Of course they are, with a QE that is an equivalent of 6.7% of US GDP as an annual gift.<br /><br />Increasing money supply by 6-7% to grow GDP by 2% is not growth, it's stretching the pizza dough. However, a problem of wrong incentives, creating fake money and artificially low rates not only dilutes the real growth but impairs its potential one. The solution that Keynesian economists offer? ... Repeat. "Until investors give in" as Paul Krugman says. More fuel to the fire.<br /><br />As growth is poor, what they propose is more booze to the alcoholic. Low rates forever. Yes, many members of the U.S. central bank, like Charles Plosser, &nbsp;expressed doubts about the effectiveness of monetary policy, and begin to propose measures to control the madness limiting the ability of the Fed to buy assets and expand its balance sheet, but these are still voices in the desert. If you really think that forcing the machine will revive investment and job creation because it is decided by a committee, it will not happen. Until the job creators clearly see the opportunities, investment will remain low.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IUG6zmYwfuc/UqGnj_HcY4I/AAAAAAAABds/svPT2-Zuu9M/s1600/US+MIRAGE+4.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="87" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IUG6zmYwfuc/UqGnj_HcY4I/AAAAAAAABds/svPT2-Zuu9M/s320/US+MIRAGE+4.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Reasons for concern:<br /><br />- Credit conditions are deteriorating alarmingly, which leads me to believe that productive investment will stagnate in 2014 . Estimates of increase of 9% do not agree with any of the messages thrown by the companies that published results and guidance.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--895TIap2tY/UqGnpPC4OrI/AAAAAAAABd0/UGhAQjLr7EQ/s1600/US+MIRAGE+5.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="209" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--895TIap2tY/UqGnpPC4OrI/AAAAAAAABd0/UGhAQjLr7EQ/s320/US+MIRAGE+5.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />- Deterioration of the leading indicators of job creation, new businesses, corporate margins and capex have accelerated since September and came into contraction long before the government shutdown.<br /><br />- Estimates of profits in the industrial and consumer sector have fallen between 8% and 10% for 2014.<br /><br />- In March, another drama on account of the debt ceiling and overspending &nbsp;and no small risk of tax hikes. With the popularity of President Obama at a minimum-37% -, the likelihood of tax increases to 'the rich', which is always translated into 'tax hikes for all', is high.<br /><br />- The so-called Obamacare -mistakenly sold as the panacea of universal public health-, means about 52 billion dollars in new taxes to small businesses in particular, and the lowest estimate of the negative impact on employment that I have read is 800,000 people .<br /><br />Yes, I know. For the stock market investor most of this is irrelevant. The worse, the better, and $85 billion of monthly asset purchases by the Federal Reserve, even if it is trimmed, makes everyone happy because the 'helicopter money' only helps the financial sector and the state, so we will 'party like it's 1999' for a while. Furthermore, investors are protected by many companies who do not fall into the trap of easy money, because they are the first to suffer when the music stops. <br /><br />I am sure that the innovative spirit of the country will prevail, but to estimate its economic development through the moves of a stock market impacted by share repurchases and 'laughing gas money' may be an illusion. Richard Koo warned that the U.S. is engaged in "the QE trap" from which you can not get out easily or comfortably. As Fleetwood Mac ...

Brent up 7% ytd at $111.38/bbl an<span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">d WTI at $99m14/bbl. The differential at $12.25. Demand growth has been better than expected and supply disruptions took 800kbpd of oil in the system. Looking to 2014 I see less supply risks and healthier demand, bringing the call on OPEC down to 29mmbpd. US will be the lion share of non-OPEC supply, keeping a wide WTI discount because of it. 2015 will see US as biggest oil producer above Saudi Arabia.</span></div><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div></span><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><div style="text-align: left;">UK gas at 69p/th ends the year up 6% yoy. The picture of tight supply and inventories plus most LNG absorbed by Japan will likely ease in 2014, to see a more moderate picture of supply-demand helped by cheaper spot LNG as japanese nuclear comes back gradually.</div></span><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div></span><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><div style="text-align: left;">Coal at $82.40/mt ends the year down 13.3% and 2014 sees a similar picture of oversupply and poor demand growth. Demand to increase by 1.5% versus supply at 3.5% is not bullish.</div></span><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div></span><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><div style="text-align: left;">CO2 crashed 30% in 2013 and ends saved partially by EU efforts to contain oversupply. At €4.67/mt, backloading only addressed a small part of the oversupply of EUAs and renewables continue to eat out of thermal generation while industrial production doesn't pick up in Europe. A flat 2014 is likely.</div></span><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div></span><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><div style="text-align: left;">German power prices at €36.70/mwh down 16% ytd, Nordpool at €32/mwh down 15% ytd... The picture is not bullish for 2014 because of the same reasons as CO2, but power prices seem to have bottomed out and the curve reflects a small inflation into 2015 as EU reduces commitment to Kyoto in favour of growth policies.</div></span><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div></span><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><div style="text-align: left;">2014 doesn't look like a year of mass commodity inflation, which bodes well for the recovery, and prices remain attractive for consumers and producers. With the oil burden at less than 5-6% of global GDP and gas well supplied and within the trading range, it's a good environment for everyone without causing a 2008 supply shock that halts the economy.</div></span></span></div>

Thomas Sowell</blockquote><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uiA1F7Stev0/Us_Wuoczx2I/AAAAAAAABl4/zEtOiEBD1ak/s1600/Spain+bond+yield+collapse.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uiA1F7Stev0/Us_Wuoczx2I/AAAAAAAABl4/zEtOiEBD1ak/s1600/Spain+bond+yield+collapse.jpg" height="193" width="320" /></a></div><span lang="EN-GB"><br /></span>Spanish bond yields have fallen to pre-crisis levels despite debt to GDP reaching c100%, a deficit that will be above the target 6.5% and refinancing needs of c€224bn in 2014. The "Draghi put", added to much better comps on unemployment (fallen by 147k in 2013), consumer spending (+2% in December) and added to expectations of an 0.5%-1% growth in GDP have helped. <br /><br />But challenges remain. Debt (public and private above 300% of GDP), unemployment (26%) are still too high, and 0.5-1% growth is simply not enough.<br /><br />. Spanish banks’ dependence on the ECB will fall from the €220.5bn of November but is still very high. In that month the Spanish Banks long-term ECB borrowings dropped by €12.0bn.<br /><br />. Bank Non-Performing Loan Ratio. This ratio likely continued to rise in November (from 13.0% in October). In the next few months, the NPL ratio should continue to rise, although at a slower pace.<br /><br />. Taxes: 40 tax raises between 2011 and 2014. And raised again in the beginning of 2014 to try to collect one billion euro more, increasing Social Security contributions as well, affecting mostly SMEs and self-employed.<br /><br />Prime Minister Rajoy will be in Washington (13 and 14-January). On Monday he will meet with Christiane Lagarde just a few days before the IMF releases the update of its 2014 growth forecast. The IMF could raise its forecast for Spain from the current +0.2%. On Tuesday, he will meet with the US Chamber of Commerce.<br /><br />I read different analysis of Spain's growth potential. Among all OECD countries, Spain is the only one that shows more divergence between expected growth (+0.5-1%) and its potential (+3% according to BBVA, Goldman Sachs and Merill Lynch). This is the opportunity cost of holding on to the 2004 model of state intervention and bureaucracy.<br /><br />I estimate Spain’s growth for 2014 at 1% and assume 250k net job creation, but this is far away from its potential. Only by laying out the red carpet to job creation and improving the opportunities to do business, Spain would attract direct financial investments of 50 billion euro and would create much more new net jobs.<br /><div><br /></div><div>By lowering SMEs and self-employed taxes, the UK did not only increase its revenue collection by 24 billion pounds, it also reduced the unemployment rate to 7%... being a net receiver of immigration. The formula: “business is great” and low taxes. Meanwhile, in Spain, we keep trying to hunt the unicorns of &nbsp;“recovering tax revenues” and telling ourselves that “we don’t have a spending problem”. <br /><br />At the peak of the real estate bubble Spain never collected more than 412 billion euro of tax revenues. However, it spends above 70 billion euro more than this historical high tax receipts of 2007, which will never return. A minimum of 30 billion euro per annum of higher expenses than bubble-peak revenues even if we deduct aid to banks and one-offs.</div><div><br /></div><div>I talk about it in my book “Viaje a la Libertad Economica" ("Journey to economic freedom”). In Spain, tax revenues have not collapsed because of fraud or the black economy, but due to the enormous dependency on construction and civil works which reached almost 20% GDP including services and grids for a demand growth that never arrived. A bubble of overcapacity to inflate artificially the country's GDP.<br /><br />And this GDP, artificially increased by “stimulating internal demand” brought as a consequence a 300% of debt. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The problem is such inflated GDP figure (c20% according to independent analysts) is the same GDP that is used to tell us that the country collects less taxes than the other countries.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Using ratios on the grounds of an artificial GDP to justify bubble spending and confiscatory taxes. It is the same subterfuge of me selling to myself something that I don’t need and I can’t afford, with debt, and then say that my business is growing, justifying by this way an unacceptable spending level.<br /><br />Spain's 2014 budget doesn’t correct that spending problem yet, and public spending remains above 2007 levels, meanwhile families' disposable income and economic activity has fallen to 2004 levels, being optimistic. It's “the public spend aristocracy”.&nbsp;</div><div><br />According to the 2014 Budget data Spain will be spending 10 billion euro in subsidies; 23 billion in “coordination and finance relationships with territorial authorities”; 690 million in State foreign action; 497 million in development cooperation; 131 million in “cultural diffusion abroad”; in “peripheral State administration” 275 million; in “news coverage” 55 million; another 83 million in meteorology (yes, I swear); actions “to prevent climate change” another 42 million; official cars spend raises 1.6% to 240 million; the mutual healthcare, which is parallel to public healthcare, means another 2 billion. Yet we hear that there is no scope for further cuts. <br /><br />But the problem is that we don’t give solutions for the two problems which are obstructing the economic recovery:<br /><br />- A "Sheriff’s of Nottingham" taxation system that is more worried about collecting the last coin and sustaining, at all cost, the unsustainable spending, instead of creating good conditions for economic growth and with them generate more tax revenues. When I read “reform” to “increase tax bases” “reduce deductions” it really means “raise taxes”. Spain is the country where fiscal pressure has increased more since 1965 after Turkey. Fiscal pressure at 40% ranks among the highest in the EU (<a href="http://www.libremercado.com/2013-01-15/el-esfuerzo-fiscal-en-espana-es-el-mas-alto-de-la-eurozona-1276479317/">read here</a>)</div><div><br />- Legal uncertainty perception. If the tax and legal environment are not clear and predictable it will be very hard to attract financial investment to create jobs and put capital in the economy for the long-term. Not to buy bonds and shares, but investing in sectors capable of making Spain recover real growth. If the system is seen ad unpredictable and risks of retroactive changes, long term investment doesn't arrive. Spain lost ten positions in the ranking of "doing business" of the Heritage Foundation (46 from 36 before).<br /><br />- Useless spend sustains a level of bureaucracy whose objective is to justify itself with endless rules (state, region, local) and ridiculous procedures. I recommend you to read the “additional competences” given to the regional authorities or the unproductive subsidies, for example. This bureaucracy and complexity acts as a block to new investment and job creation. Between 2008 and 2011 public spending&nbsp;in the Eurozone&nbsp;increased almost 7% to nearly 4.65€ billion. In southern countries, the most affected by the so-called “austerity”, at least in theory, the evolution is similar: From 2008 public spending has grown 8.6% in France, 4% in Spain, 3% in Italy and 7.8% in Portugal.&nbsp;</div><div><br />However, economic activity and disposable income have fallen to 2004 levels. Instead of considering that spending must be adapted to the economic cycles and that prosperity always had come from saving, we start to thinking that an excessive spending problem will be fixed with more spending.  </div><div>To spending there is always a reason, the "position rent" is created. Once this bureaucratic entity is created &nbsp;justifying it is easier than restricting/cutting it. Look at Spain's loss-making public companies. Only four out of 4.000 have been closed.&nbsp;</div><div><br />However, there is never a margin to lower taxes and boost the economy. There is nothing more permanent than a “temporal” raise of taxes. Then, when the country gets into depression, the "solution offered" is more public spending as the “way out of the crisis” which has been created by excessive spending in the first place.&nbsp;</div><div><br />Everyone sees the enormous potential of Spain. Growing 1% in 2014 its fine. Thinking that this is enough and we don’t have to reduce more superfluous spending is dangerous. <br /><br />2014 will be much better than consensus estimates. I don’t doubt it. But it could be much better. There is a huge potential and, if Spain wants, it can surpass it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Further read: "Spain, bottoming out"&nbsp;<a href="http://energyandmoney.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/spain-bottoming-out.html">http://energyandmoney.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/spain-bottoming-out.html</a></div></div>
