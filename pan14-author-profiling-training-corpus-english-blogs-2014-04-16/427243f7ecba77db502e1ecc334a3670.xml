I am no longer waiting for classes to start, waiting to hear back about English classes, waiting for information about my internship, it’s all over. Now, everything has begun.

This is probably the longest break I&#8217;ve taken from this blog. I have legitimate reasons for my long absence in the blogosphere. It&#8217;s this awful thing called Graduate School.

I’ve got the entire routine down, memorized, and I almost hate that because the trip is an enormous hassle.

I didn’t want something lame &#8211; - which I must admit, that’s what I got &#8211; - or something cliché that I feel most ex-pat blogs &#8230; <a href="http://grahamcruise.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/madrid-with-50-american-students/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=grahamcruise.wordpress.com&#038;blog=15801294&#038;post=2570&#038;subd=grahamcruise&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Well to begin, I had a month there where I wasn’t writing because I was going through some major transitions.
