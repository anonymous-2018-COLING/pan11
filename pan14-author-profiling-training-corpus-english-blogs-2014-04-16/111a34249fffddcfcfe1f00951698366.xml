font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">I was back down a pound today from yesterday.&nbsp; Good way to start the day!&nbsp; I'm hoping that&nbsp;I continue to trend in that direction.&nbsp; However it was going to be hard today because of what was on tap for dinner.&nbsp; I don't really need to speak much to my breakfast or lunch (itâ€™s outlined below in the recap).&nbsp; But dinner, well that was a treat for me.&nbsp; Dawn told me early in the day that she was making stuffed peppers.&nbsp; When I got the news I was like a kid on Christmas Eve!&nbsp; Stuffed peppers are one of my favorite meals and I could probably eat 6 of them with no problem.&nbsp; However for those that have had them know they are stuffed with rice which means lots of carbs!&nbsp; It wasn't going to matter; I had been looking forward to dinner all day and knew I was going to enjoy myself.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;

We had some dinner rolls and a&nbsp;salad to go with the peppers.&nbsp; I didn't go overboard and had one and a half to go along with my salad and roll.&nbsp; This worked out because now I have 4 leftover I can enjoy this week for lunch.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;

I didn't go out for a run because Tuesdays are normally a day I give my legs a rest, but I have a feeling that I should have gone.</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;

It's been hard to of late just because of everything we have been doing.  Plus all my posts seem to cover about the same stuff, so they must be boring to read as I know they are boring to write.<br /><br />However don't worry, I'm not giving this up.  I will continue to post about my weight and the journey to break 200.  I have 32 pounds to go and know I can do it.  My original goal was to break 200 by my 35th birthday, however with only 16 days left I don't think that's going to happen.  Im aiming for being at 220 by that time.  12 pounds in 16 days is a reach, but I think I can do it (as long as my allergies get better).<br /><br />So for now going forward I will post something when I feel it's needed, such as a good weight number, or big family event, etc.  I would also like to mix my personal life and it's adventures in to this blog.  Afterall anything I do is part of this journey.<br /><br />Till next time..........

This was not what I had planned and sure as heck not what I wanted! &nbsp;So right then I made the call that today was going to be the last day this non focused, non determined Bryan would be around. &nbsp;I told myself "pig out all you want today because come tomorrow its time to get down to business". &nbsp;So come dinner time it hit me that I needed to end the day with the same way I did the night before my journey started. &nbsp;I needed to stuff my face with something that would leave a mark for the rest of the night and leave me feeling like crap. &nbsp;For those that remember it was Filberto's that did the trick last time. &nbsp;So tonight's "final meal" was yet again Filberto's. &nbsp;I got a Steak &amp; Egg Burrito and 3 rolled tacos with cheese &amp; sour cream. &nbsp;I would never eat this much from there and normally can barley finish my burrito, but the plan was to pretty much make myself feel horrible so the meal would stick fresh in my mind. &nbsp;Well it did the trick, and I couldn't even finish everything. &nbsp;But I know for a fact that come tomorrow and all next week I will still be thinking about that meal!</span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Another thing I decided to do to help lose the weight and kick start it again is grow my beard. &nbsp;Everyone knows that I can grow a pretty awesome beard and grow it pretty quickly. &nbsp;It had been a good 4 or 5 days since I last shaved, so today when I went in to clean up decided that I would grow out my beard and not shave it till I get back to my lowest point of 225 pounds. &nbsp;This is great motivation because its summer time in Arizona. &nbsp;Who the heck wants a beard in this heat! &nbsp;However it will only be a face beard as I will keep the neck clean. &nbsp;Come on, I'm not a total idiot!</span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">So with that said wish me luck (again) as I get back on track and finish what I started a year ago this month. &nbsp;Tomorrow is gong to be a great day for me!</span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Till tomorrow.......</span></div>

I'm going to keep up on this blog and post more often! &nbsp;I am however trying something new where each week I give myself a goal. &nbsp;Something that I know I need to do better at or improve upon. &nbsp;This week's goal, September 10th - 16th, will be to not eat any fast food or drink soda. &nbsp;Maybe this will help drop some pounds.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span"
