A guide to human rights for small and medium-sized enterprises&#8221;. I had the honor to attend the presentation of the first draft last September in Brussels. It&#8217;s a short, reader-friendly document, and I encourage small companies to read it, because [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=businesswithcommonsense.wordpress.com&#038;blog=32060817&#038;post=132&#038;subd=businesswithcommonsense&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

This is how a software for sustainability reporting was described recently. It cannot get any &#8220;wronger&#8221;. From a stakeholders perspective, what they demand is relevant information in order to get a true picture of the company&#8217;s overall performance and its contribution to the social [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=businesswithcommonsense.wordpress.com&#038;blog=32060817&#038;post=145&#038;subd=businesswithcommonsense&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

This is a great occasion to reflect on the role of sustainability advisors and about whom CSR consultants are accountable to. As a CSR advisor I am usually hired on behalf [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=businesswithcommonsense.wordpress.com&#038;blog=32060817&#038;post=154&#038;subd=businesswithcommonsense&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Personally I really like this definition of corporate social responsibility. If companies had been conducted in an ethical way, we would not be stuck in the current crisis of trust and lack of transparency. Ethical management is a burning question that is reflected on a [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=businesswithcommonsense.wordpress.com&#038;blog=32060817&#038;post=161&#038;subd=businesswithcommonsense&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

This is the result of the poll I published some weeks ago. This option reached 58,4% of the votes. The rest of the options were*: Society and the common good, with 10% of the votes.

And, while I am resting, I hope I&#8217;ll have time to find out why so many of the so called sustainable companies (you know, the ones that perform so well at indexes such as the DJSI), are still whether socially responsible not sustainable. I think I have a hint.

This is a very good sign, yet, is it enough? Does it mean that companies are actually becoming more sustainable? Critics argue that CSR strategies and reports tend to mask other activities that are genuinely contrary to the benefit of planet and society.

In my previous post I analysed the shortcomings of the implementation of CSR strategies.  Now, how could we solve these shortcomings? For me there are some key factors: CSR Reporting fails to give a true picture of companies.
